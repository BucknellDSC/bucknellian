Lifestyles,"By Michael M cGandy Staff Writer Historically the relationship between Bucknell students, espe cially those who live off-campus, and the residents of the Borough of Lewisburg has been marked by tension. On the streets and in the neighborhoods of Lewisburg, the differing lifestyles and perceptions of students and local residents per ennially bring them into conflict over such issues as parties, noise level, and property maintenance. ""I think there is always going to be a conflict between student lifestyles and resident lifestyles,"" said Nada Gray, Lewisburg Bor ough Manager. This continuing ten sion between students and resi dents, though, does have its intense periods and its lulls. Presently the University and the Borough of Lewisburg are attempting to mend and improve relations after a stormy month of September last year. According to John Dunlop, dean of student life, the 1989-90 academic year ""began with a bang,"" marked by frequent citations served to Bucknell students for noise disturbance and a rising voice of protest amongst local residents. rains that plagued the Susquehana Valley this summer caused numer ous delays for campus construction projects. Paving of the new parking lot behind Fraternity Row, for example, was delayed until yesterday. The underpass is the latest in a series of measures to optimize safety at the heavily trafficked intersection at the Route 15 entrance to the campus on Moore Avenue.

Sometimes described as the hub of the Univer sity and formerly named the Uni versity Center, the newly rededi cated Langone Center is typically the site where incoming students spend hours upon their arrival to Bucknell. The Center is also under going a major renovation project which adds to the usual turmoil found on the ground floor level. Indeed, despite the name change, the Langone Center remains very much the center of the University for students. Within its By Andrew Cohen Staff Writer Bucknell's Greek system faces a major overhaul this year. On May 12, 1990, the Board of Trustees approved all but one of President Sojka's recommenda tions for improving Bucknell's Greek system. Throughout this year, Sojka, with the aid of stu dents and faculty, will determine means for implementing these recommendations. Sojka announced his wide- ranging proposals for the ""social- residential system"" at an ""Open Forum"" on May 1. Sojka's recom mendations are intended to gener ally enhance the ""social residential system,"" however, the campus was most affected by those recommen dations specifically concerning the Greek system. Under Sojka's plan, fresh men will be able to attend all ""open"" fraternity and sorority par ties in '91-'92. According to Ed Dadez, Associate Dean of Residen tial Life, this year freshmen may visit fraternity houses or sorority suites for the first six weeks of school excluding parties. Last year freshmen were prohibited from fre quenting fraternities and sororities during the first six weeks. Addi tionally, Greek organizations would be limited to two ""closed,"" or invitation-only, parties a month. Sojka's rush proposals also promise to put a new face on the Greek system. After this year, only upperclassmen will be allowed to rush. Rush will take place in '91- '92 during the first ten days of school or anytime after. Also, Sojka proposed that every eligible rushee be guaranteed a bid in some By David Murray Staff Writer Because of a delay caused by the discovery of asbestos, the new Bison, located across from the Bookstore in the Elaine Langone Center, will not open until early November. ""Because of the exten sive nature of the construction, the engineering firm suggested that we should remove it,"" said Mary Dor sey, acting director of the Langone Center. 'T h e removal ate up all of June and most of July,"" said Barry Maxwell, vice president for administration. After the asbestos was brick walls students purchase their books, receive their mail, attend classes, and take their meals. On the floors of the Center one can find a comfortable comer in which to study as well as go to the offices of Residential Life to work out some bureaucratic difficulty. The new Bison and Bullseye being con structed on the ground floor will provide a space for students to eat, socialize, and recreate that was hitherto unknown at Bucknell. Center Renamed The creation of a new Bison and Bullseye is the first major pro ject undertaken in the Center since it was renamed to honor Elaine Langone, wife of Kenneth Langone ' 57 . Originally dedicated in 1970, the Center was rededicated on a weekend in May when the Univer- Greek organization, though not necessarily the organization of the rushee's choice. Living in fraternity houses, and to a lesser extent, sorority suites, will be much different once Sojka's proposals are implemented. All Greek organizations living in ""social-residential"" units will be responsible for hiring live-in house managers. Additionally all stu dents wishing to live off-campus will need written permission from By Bob Ritter Staff Writer As students return for the fall semester, the echoes of hammers and saws can still be heard across the campus. The start of the $9.75 million Biology Building construc tion project is the largest element in a flury of construction that includes the Bison/Bullseye renovation, the Route 15 underpass, the new uphill parking lot, the new Bucknell West intramural fields and the Psychol ogy primate lab renovations. When all of the current activity subsibes, what will be next on the University drawing board? Barry Maxwell, vice presi dent for administration, explained that all major capital improvements arc determined by a construction priority committee, which evaluates all construction requests on a yearly basis, assigning them to one of three categories of urgency. Among the university to do so. This directly affects the ten fraternities that own their houses --  three fra ternity houses are owned by the university, and one fraternity (Kappa Alpha Psi) does not have a house yet. Fraternity members will now have to apply for permission to live in their own houses. Sojka has not yet provided a criteria for who may or may not live off cam pus, which has fraternity members worried that Sojka could use this to the items on this year's highest pri ority list is the renovation of Trax Hall, which Maxwell expects to be approved for next year. Renovation plans include air-conditioned social space on the first floor and two-room doubles, changes designed to accomodate a larger attempt at class-integrated housing ""choke"" fraternity houses of live-in brothers. These changes arc the result of a long process which involved all parts of the Bucknell commu nity.

Bucknellian,August 31 1990
W elcom e to Bucknell,"Welcome class of 1994. By now you ve bought your books, your schedule is for the most part set, and you have a few budding friendships. Your R.A., along with the rest of Residential Life have told what you can not do while you're here at Bucknell. And, invariably, they have given you an overly optimistic characterization of what you may accom plish during your years at this fine institution. What we have presented on these four pages is a short glimpse of what Bucknell is. These are the happen ings of a university entering its second century of existence: construction, academia and the on-going dilemma of how to grapple with student life. Act 31, and the university's interpretational enforcement of the Commonwealth's law, precludes us from drinking in the pnvacy of our own dormitory rooms, crowding into fraternity house basements to socialize and have a beer - and in some views, from generally having a good time. But alas, we are adjusting, albeit slowly. The Greek system, a long-standing and revered tradition here at Bucknell, has sustained some pretty heavy damage, mostly in terms of lofty criticism by faculty, staff and community. Most Greeks and alumni are upset, yet seem to be adapting to the notion of restructuring. Again, the administration and the often obscure ""powers that be embodied in the Board of Trustees, have dictated a very drastic change. The ball has now been handed down to us. We are to work within a predecided framework to restructure ""our"" system. The Bison/Bullseye renovation project is slated for completion in early November. And the same folks who are bringing you playfair and exciting dinners with celebrities like Gary Sojka and Charlotte Jacobsen Weddle, are planning all kinds of neat activities with which you may occupy your time during ^our stay here at Bucknell. This, you must think, is the good news. It's change - student space seems to be receiving the priority it should have received years ago; students will now have an updated social space all to themselves. It's about time. The really good news, other than the fact that the University has spent over $10 million in the past year building buildings, is that opportunities for you abound at Bucknell. Whether it's running for class representative in the Bucknell Student Government (BSG), running track, joining a fraternity or sorority or becoming a member of one of the other organizations on campus - there is a veritable plethora of opportunity. You have the chance to be political, journalistic or even artsy. This is what Bucknell is all about. Opportu nity. Opportunity for individual growth, to explore the vast wealth of knowledge that is our faculty and staff to finally seek out those deeper things in life and yourself. You have only four years in which to cover this ground Carpe Diem. This is what you can do at Bucknell. You can effect change on campus and better student life. More impor tantly, you can expand your own horizons. While we can't go as far as to say that ""What you put into Bucknell you will get back out, as Residential Life staffers will try to firmly impress upon you, we do believe in the con cept of opportunity and student empowerment. This is your chance, make the most of it. Don't fall into the trap set for you that is orientation. Orient yourselves, and form your own perspectives. Recognize Bucknell University for what it is, and what it means to you. We urge you to take notice of what is around you. Make your decisions wisely and plot your course with care. ;"

Town-Gown,"From page 1 Dunlop. Indeed, Dunlop is of the opinion that the whole tenor of town-student relations is largely improving. Dunlop cites the coop erative effort of town officials, local landlords, concerned students, and the University's administration as the cause of this positive devel opment and increased communica tion between parties representing the Borough and the University on the Town-Gown Committee. Student Rentals Traditionally, a segment of the student population has lived off campus in rental units on streets adjacent to the campus. Leases passed from student to student for years creating what amounts to a student neighborhood comprised of St. George, S l Catherine, South 7th, and South 6th streets. Accord ing to Gray, before even consider ing the behavior of student resi dents, there are certain patterns inherent in student rentals which detract from a residential area. Primarily there is what she calls a ""cycle of neglect"" Some landlords who rent to students do so for two reasons--higher rents can be asked since students are con sidered to be more affluent and less maintenance can be offered since students are less demanding than a family-oriented resident. Students themselves, according to Gray, not only ask less of their landlord in terms of maintenance, but often neglect to maintain their residence since they lack the experience of having to be responsible for a home. The result of this cycle is that there are neighborhoods in Lewis burg which have been poorly main tained and the landlord and future renters cannot be expected to improve the condition of the unit. The second negative aspect of student neighborhoods is that they are abandoned during school holidays and breaks. As busy and vibrant as the South 6th Street neighborhood may be during the fall and spring terms, it is desolate during the summer ~his sense of a transient population is largely not considered to be conducive to attracting families and other more permanent residents to these areas. Indeed, according to Gray, it is the goal of the Borough and par ticularly the Housing Authority of Union County to encourage a more stable residency base in Lewisburg. ""It would be nice to have more family-owned or owner- operator housing in Lewisburg,"" Gray said, ""but in moving towards that we may have already gone as far as we can go."" Having passed Borough ordinances stipulating that no more than three unrelated per sons can live in a residence and calling for stricter property codes, the Borough had hoped to limit the expansion of student rentals. While it is unclear how suc cessful these ordinances will be, it is the case that both this year and last year, student rentals were not only found in the South 6th Street neighborhood, but there were pock ets on Market, South Fifth, and South Fourth streets and on other blocks of St. Catherine Street. ""I don't know how you can achieve an influx of owner- operated housing in Lewisburg with an open market without get ting involved in homesteading and government financing,"" Gray said. The Housing Authority of Union County is looking at the possibility of public financing, according to Gray, but they are not at the stage of serious planning. Increased Conflict While these issues concern ing the demographics of residential neighborhoods in Lewisburg are of ongoing importance to town-gown relations, it is the more particular and immediate issues of parties, noise levels, and public drunken ness that aroused the protest of the Borough community. With refer ence to these complaints from the Borough community, according to Dunlop, unruly student behavior at, and traveling to and from parties in town is the direct cause. In-town parties at student ren tal and students patronizing the bar are both typical student behaviors that are to be expected by Borough residents, and yet the behavior involved in these activities evoke an unprecedented negative response. Considering letters and opinion articles that appeared in The Bucknellian during that period there appeared to be two new fac tors which may have exacerbated the already-existing the conflict between students and the local community. The first is that social life on campus began to change radically as fraternities began to strictly enforce University policies against under-twenty-one drinking and became less of a focal point for socializing and drinking. One, per haps predictable, result was that more students, including many freshmen, went off-campus to engage in those activities where they would not be strictly moni tored by campus security forces, including Residential Assistants and administrators from the office of Residential Life. In addition to an increase in off-campus parties and the number of people attending them, the increasingly spread out locations of student rentals brought students and their parties into contact with more local residents than before. The result of these two trends in student social life was that more Lewisburg residents were affected by students, often negatively, creat ing a larger and more vociferous body of complaint. The response of the Borough was to call on the Uni versity to control its students, accompanied by Chief of Police Bob Heiter's vows to arrest any unruly students in town. Student Neighbors Both Gray and Dunlop are of the opinion that these sorts of stu dent-resident conflicts are not indicative of students in general, but of a small minority of ""prob lem students. Unfortunately, according to Dunlop, the behavior of a few students gives a bad repu tation to the Bucknell student body as a whole. ''Misdeeds and stories of mis- deeds are like rabbits, they multi ply,"" Dunlop said suggesting that those misdeeds have been applied to more students than they should be. Gray concurred stating that the relationship between student renters and their neighbors who are more permanent residents cannot be assessed through generalities. ""It depends on the behavior of individ ual students in individual units,"" she said. Gray herself has had stu dent neighbors over the years and found many to be fine, while others were quite poor. What is necessary is commu nication between student renters and their neighbors. It is important, Gray said, for students and local residents to ""get to know each other as people before they know each other as problems."" According to Gray this responsibility lies with both the student and the local resident. Four-Year Residency Both Dunlop and Gray stated that, while tensions in town-gown From page 1 second floor of the Langone Cen ter, while space in the Scullery will be used to provide additional Bison seating. To supplement food service available in the Bison itself. Hank Ross, director of dining services, predicted that ""in the interim, we'll cook burgers and things on a gas grill on the grass outside"" the Lan gone Center. He also suggested ""putting a cart on the mall up by the library"" which will sell coffee, drinks, and pastries during the breakfast hours. Ross believes such stop-gap measures will be well received, relations may continue to exist, the Borough and the University are unified in their desire to ease the conflict and establish a basis for improved student-resident relations in the future. The new four-year residency requirement that accom panied a package of recommenda tions approved by the trustees relat ing to the Greek issue appears to be an effort on the part of the Univer sity to gain more control over what sort of student lives off campus and is in close contact with the Lewis burg community. The four-year residency requirement, originally proposed by President Gary Sojka in the spring, stipulates that the University can demand that a student live in cam pus housing throughout his or her time at Bucknell. Students, as a result, would have to request per mission from Residential Life to rent an apartment or house in Lewisburg. While Sojka has stated that this mechanism would be used sparingly to prevent ""problem"" stu- ""due to the fact that we have such an understanding student body."" He is enthusiastic, too, that ""a lot of stuff's happening in the Bison."" Food service available in the new Bison will be greatly expanded compared to the service formerly available. Ross said he plans to send out a proposed menu, ""so peo ple are aware of what to expect"" He anticipates take-out pizza and char-broiled foods, frozen yogurt and a salad bar. Additionally, he plans spe cialty events like Mexican night and seafood night On certain even ings, Ross plans a ""bistro kind of menu, with table service"" available. He also hopes to use glass and china utensils to replace the dispos- dents from living in town, it has also been suggested in discussions on campus that this policy might be a safety net for the University which may be facing declining enrollments along with other col leges and universities. Considering the possibility of empty dormitory beds, the Univer sity could use the four-year resi dency requirement to ensure that its residence halls are filled. At present, though, the policy is likely only to be used to restrain students who have been cited for extreme or chronic cases of misconduct. Insofar as the four-year resi dency requirement, to be instituted in the next academic year, Gray said that Borough officials are pleased with the step the University has taken. 'It will make it more of a reward to live off-campus,"" Gray stated, based on student behavior, academics, and attitude."" The new University policy, according to Gray, should act to ""filter out troublemakers."" able products previously utilized. Dorsey, also believes the new Bison ""should be worth waiting for. Along with the plans of dining services, Dorsey said that many programs are planned for the new space, including live entertainment on weekend nights and feature film showings during the week. Before the new space is completed. Uni versity social programming will be held in alternate locations such as the Terrace Room, the Langone Center Forum, and Larison Dining Hall. 8 Details on the project's progress are currently located on the walls enclosing the construction area."

Interview,
A&S Dean Gerdes prepares,
in curriculum,
changes,"By Michael McGandy Staff Writer ""I think that one thing which is distinct about the position of dean is that the dean is the one that makes sure that the day-to-day issues are dealt with,"" said Dean of Arts and Sciences Eugenia Gerdes, who was appointed last spring. But while the office of the dean may concentrate on the day-to-day events of Bucknell, Gerdes has some plans that may significantly affect the University. Gerdes, who has been at Bucknell for fourteen years as a professor of psychology and two years as an administrator, expressed particular interest in reju venating an active concern for the quality of teaching on the part of the University. More importantly, though, Gerdes is already partici pating in an effort to revise the Uni versity's general education program. These ""day-to-day"" concerns such as faculty-student ratios, teaching loads, and residential col leges, Gerdes stated, ""if taken together do have a significant impact on the institution and make it necessary that we step back and examine our principles."" Two principles that Gerdes identified as central to the Bucknell education were quality teaching and critical thinking, and she is undertaking projects to support and augment both. ""It is very clear that we are interested in how our faculty teaches,"" Gerdes said. ""This is the place where the dean's office has to play a leading role."" Gerdes cited the ""mentor pro gram"" that was adopted recently by the faculty which would provide teaching assistance for the junior faculty teacher from a senior faculty member outside of his or her department. ""It is okay for a faculty mem ber to be looking for ways to improve their teaching,"" Gerdes said. ""It docs not amount to a per sonal weakness because we were not taught how to teach."" Gerdes said that most graduate programs do very little to develop the teach ing talents of its students who arc soon to become professors. The most important task of the teacher, according to Gerdes, is to develop their students' ability to think critically. Responding to a faculty that is disappointed in the level of critical thinking in the stu dent body, Gerdes has undertaken the task to coordinate a new general education program for the University. ""We are saying to the faculty,"" Gerdes commented, ""if you arc disappointed with the criti cal thinking of your students, help us develop those skills in students."" The initial outcome of this effort is a pilot program of Founda tion Seminars that is being offered this semester for the class of 1994. These courses are inter-disciplinary programs which will require that students approach the topics at hand from a number of perspec tives. Examples of topics are ""Zen and the Arts,"" ""Learning in an Information Age,"" and ""Darwin ism: The Lamp and its Shadow."" The class size is to be capped at around fifteen students, with the instructor serving as advisor to most of the students enrolled in the class Gerdes said that the effort arose out of the desire to institu-"
Sojka --,"tionally answer the question of what it means to be educated. ""We have to state more explicity that students have to see the world from a variety of perspectives,"" Gerdes said, ""not just the ones they came to Bucknell with."" According to Gerdes a key component of these Foundation Seminars will be addressing issues of race, class, and gender which can often become secondary issues amongst Buck- nell's relatively homogeneous stu dent body. Explicitly addressing such issues is part of a larger national trend within universities respond ing both to recognized absences in their curriculum and an attempt to use education to combat the ignor ance that leads to violence against minority populations on campus. Gerdes said that, while the situation at Bucknell is much less severe than at other institutions, ""there is an overt sense among some students of 'I'm in the major ity--my views are right and the others are wrong.'"" Jimmy King/File Photo Dean Eugenia Gerdes ""The issues are there,"" Gerdes stated, ""and although Buck nell is relatively homogeneous the world is not that way."" Beyond this initial year, Gerdes said that there are tentative plans to develop a program based on the principles of the Foundation Seminars for a larger general edu cation program that would replace the present system of distribution requirements. This general outline of the Foundation Seminars resembles that of the Freshman Advisory Seminars and Gerdes noted that ""the Foundation Seminars may not be too far from their original pur pose."" Gerdes said that the Univer sity had not provided enough insti tutional support for the"
FAS,"program and, as a result, it has not fulfilled the hopes that people origi nally had for it. A memorandum from the General Education Committee, of which Gerdes is a member, detail ing the objectives and initial stages of planning for the Foundation Seminars was mailed to faculty in March and has met with a response that Gerdes called ""mixed."" Gerdes did say that people who were involved with FAS or the residen tial colleges seemed to be more favorably inclined toward the program. Questions have been raised as to whether the program would be more historically oriented or more concerned with current affairs and crises--both approaches have a body of adherents. There is also the criticism that the approach sup ported by Gerdes strays too far from a ""great-books"" conception of general education. Gerdes says that she has already been told by critics that this plan for creating a general educa tion program on the plan of the Foundation Seminars would repre sent anything but general education. Looking ahead, as a plan for the development of the larger gen eral education plan out of this pilot project, Gerdes expressed what she called ""a very tentative plan"" for a system based on clusters of courses. ""Instead of taking four humanities but the University not taking an interest in which four the student takes, there wold be a theme."" The goal of such a cluster program would be, according to Gerdes, ""not to go on in a particular field, but to think and deal with the world."" ""Right now, with our general education requirement, we do not ask that there be any coherence in the student's program,"" Gerdes said. On more general issues con cerning her new office Gerdes said that she understood the position of the dean to be, primarily, the level of administration that is directly in contact with faculty and students and responsible for mediating the concerns of these groups. As a mediator and mutual representative of the interests of the administration, the faculty, and the students it is sometimes difficult to see how the dean can be an autono mous position. Part of being dean, according to Gerdes, is ""keeping things in line with the thinking of the people in the higher levels of administration. The dean's deci sions have to fit into that context."" Yet there is more to the posi tion than mediation. ""There is a delicate balance,"" Gerdes added, ""in having to be part of a total administrative picture and dealing actively with issues. I must be able to understand the issues from those three perspective [administration, faculty, and student] and be seen as having some integrity of my own."" Gerdes said that her long experience at Bucknell as both a faculty member and an administra tor have given her the ability to understand the differing perspec tives on the issues that concern the University. Asked about recent tensions between the faculty and the admin istration surrounding issues of teaching, scholarship, and recent decisions by the University Review Committee, Gerdes said, ""I per ceive the situation as somewhat better than it was a couple of years ago."" ""It might just be a fact of life,"" Gerdes said with reference to the distance that lies between the faculty and administration. ""When there arc different roles there tends to be some reservation about peo ple in roles other than your own."" ""Differences between people can be extreme or they can be mini mal, but they cannot be completely removed,"" Gerdes stated. She went on to say that the problems facing Bucknell were actually part of larger national trends in higher education. From page 1 faculty meeting. Jenks argued that the Greek system is sexist, elitist, racist, and anti-intellectual. The motion was tabled until the faculty received the report from the Greek Review Comittee (GRC), formed because of incidentswhich occurred during 1988-89. The report con cluded that Bucknell's Greek sys tem should be retained with minor changes. But the faculty disagreed with the report, and they over whelmingly approved Jenks' motion. After a long review pro cess, in which Sojka had to weigh the views of the student body, the faculty, and the approximately 800 alumni who wrote to him, Sojka delivered his recommendations to the Board of Trustees on May 1. His proposals elicited a backlash from the faculty because they did not feel that the measures taken properly dealt with the charges of sexism, elitism, racism, and anti- intellectualism. They then circu lated a petition condemning elitist organizations on campus. However, this protest did not significantly affect the Trustees' decision. Sojka's recommendations were reviewed by a special comittee of five trustees. This committee approved all of Sojka's recommen dations, except one which would have required a minimum GPA of 2.5 to rush, as opposed to the 2.0 minimum for participation in all other campus groups. Finally, the Board of Trustees adopted all of the committee's recommendations except the 2.5 GPA.

As far as the new name of the Center gaining currency amongst the University community, Asso ciate Vice President for Student Life Charlotte Jacobsen Weddle said that the process would undoubtedly take time. In speaking with upperclassmen, Jacobsen Weddle found many who state that, to them, the building would always be the University Center. Others have taken to calling the building the L.C., and some have begun to refer to the Elaine Langone Center as the E.L.C. (pronounced elk). Stating that ""the student ver nacular comes from its own ori gins,"" Jacobsen Weddle believes that students will eventually arrive at a term which will satisfy their tastes and eventually gain wide spread usage. What is important, according to Jacobsen Weddle, is that the Center continues to serve as the center of the University. Jacobsen Weddle referred to the Center as being ""the living room of the Uni versity"" where students, faculty, administrators, and staff meet on an"
Plans --,"From page 1 At the same time, the campus space committee is beginning its evalua tion to determine the future use of Taylor Hall, the Botany Building and the Old Bison, all of which will be vacated when the new science complex is completed. One propo sal suggests relocating the person nel department and the career development center to the Botany building. Maxwell expects that the most likely use includes a combina tion of administrative staff offices and classroom space. He did clearly state that there is no truth to the long-standing rumor that Taylor Hall will become an ""executive egalitarian basis over meals and at meetings. Part of the Family Both Elaine and Kenneth Langone, who were the focus of the May rededication ceremony for the Center, recognize Bucknell as being highly significant in their lives. As an alumnus Mr. Langone remained closely associated with the University and was elected to the board of trustees and named chair of national giving in 1981. Mrs. Langone, according to her friends and family, shared her hus band's dedication to Bucknell. Married in 1956, the Langones lived in an apartment on Market Street during Mr. Langone's senior year at Bucknell. ""Bucknell University has been a par of our family,"" Mrs. Langone said in May as she acknowledged the gesture Mr. Lan gone and the University made in renaming the Center in her honor. Beyond offering the Univer sity an opportunity to name this central building something more colorful than the ""University Cen ter,"" the rcdcdication is important relative to the University's endow ment According to University pol icy, at least fifty percent of the orig- building"" housing the top adminis trators and academic deans. The new campus landscape master plan is also expected early this semester, according to Max well. Included in the report will be recommendations for on-hill park ing and green space. Included in the report will be recommendations for the Olin-Dana quad. Plans to remove the road between the build ings and landscape the area have been discussed. While the master plan will not specifically address the issue of dwindling open space as a campus-wide issue, Maxwell said, ""[The Univeristy community] is concerned about the loss of green space, and we share that concern."""
Underpass--,"From page 1 very fortunate to this point [that there have been no accidents],"" Naugle said in a May interview with The Bucknellian. University administration, students, and the engineering firm constructing the underpass have all expressed concern about the safety of persons using the underpass. As specified in a February memoran dum, Barry Maxwell, vice presi dent for administration, explained that several measures are being taken to insure the safety of stu dents. These safety measures include 24-hour video security monitoring and ""push-to-talk""-type microphones that will provide direct contact with Bucknell Secur ity. It is the opinion of those involved in the project that this combination of security measures will provide students with a signifi cantly safer means of access to and from Bucknell West. The construction of the underpass, though hindered by inclement weather during the sum mer, is on budget and only two weeks behind schedule, according to Naugle. He said, ""all that's left is the finish work"" and that should be completed in about two weeks."

New alcohol policy implemented,
Student groups find problems with,
BSG od hoc committee formed to,"Colin Bridgewater/The Bucknellian President Sojka addresses the Trustee Implementation Planning task force as steering committee co-chair Charlotte Jacobsen looks on. By Andrew Cohen Staff Writer Bucknell's new alcohol pol icy was put into affect on Septem ber 7, 1990. The policy, authored by John P. Dunlop, Dean of Stu dents, and approved by President Sojka, completely outlines the uni versity's rules governing alcohol, and sanctions for violations. The policy, which all stu dents received by campus mail, is dated August 31. According to Dunlop though, students did not receive the policy until September 6, making Friday September 7, the first full day that students were aware of the policy. The policy includes manda tory punishments for both individu als and groups that increase with each violation. Dunlop will be issu ing an addendum for group sanc tions. As the policy stands now, groups face two weeks for their first violation. Dunlop's addendum will stiffen the penalty to two weeks of social probation for each infraction that occurs during a group's first violation. For exam ple, an unregistered party carries four violations: 1) not registering the party; 2) failure to hire a secur ity monitor; 3) failure to hire a bar tender; and 4) alcohol outside of the segregated drinking area. Each violation in this scenario would result in two weeks social proba tion, and thus the group would face eight total weeks of social probation. Dunlop concedes that Act 31 played a major role in the new pol-"
new penalties,

investigate,"icy. "" Misuse of alcohol is an increasing concern to the Univer sity as it was to society in general and state legislatures... [The legisla ture made] it very clear that they passed Act 31 for universities. They know drinking has been very very prevalent"" Some student groups have voiced concern over certain aspects of the policy. Specifically, Buck nell Student Government (BSG) unanimously passed a motion to create an ad hoc committee to look into where money collected from fines will go, and possible alterna tives for group sanctions. Currently, money collected from both individual and group fines is being held in escrow. According to George Smirnoff, author of the motion, the committee will attempt to come up with a fair system for dispensing this money to campus groups. Smirnoff also expressed con cern over the issue of mandatory sanctions for group violations. He noted that compulsory punishments only punish the fact that some vio lation was committed while they fail to "" punish the [specific] crime."" While Dunlop and BSG had come close to reaching agreement on all other aspects o f the policy, See P O L IC Y , page 5"
Caf worker charged in,
"theft of $8,000 in goods",
T.I.P. begins work on social/,
residential recommendations,"By Andrew Cohen and Bob Ritter Staff Writers Students, faculty, administra tors, and alumni met to discuss the future of Bucknell's "" social- residential"" system on Sunday Sep tember 9,1990. The 83 people who attended the meeting, now mem bers o f the Trustee Implementation Planning (TIP) task force, arc charged with the task of developing a vehicle for instituting the social reforms that the trustees enacted on May 12, 1990. Many faculty mem bers stayed away from the work shop because of dissatisfaction with the proposals being discussed. Dave Skena '92, president of Buck nell Student Government (BSG), and Charlotte Jacobsen-Weddle, vice president for student life, will co-chair the task force's steering committee. President Gary Sojka formally opened the meeting by stressing the importance of student participation in deciding their own future. "" It has to be a student led thing, but there has to be structure... Students are to lead us to the answers that we want."" Skena and Jacobsen have attempted to develop such a struc ture by creating five task teams focusing on different areas of the plan: Changes in the Greek System, Residential Changes, Social Changes, the Freshman Year Expe rience, and the Residency Require ment Each team was given target completion dates for its recommen dation to Sojka. Sojka must then approve the recommendations or send them back to the particular task team to be reworked. (Each task team chose a chair at the meet ing on Sunday to serve on the Steering Committee with Skena and Jacobsen). According to Jacobsen- Weddle, the teams will have open weekly meetings. She described the Task Force as "" very much a sun shine process where we're open in our discussions and deliberations."" Though she did add that ""executive sessions"" might sometimes be neccessary.

Ferraro cleared of,
criminal charges,"By Michael M cGandy Staff Writer In response to the arrest of a Bucknell employee for the theft of food products this July, Dining Ser vices and the Office o f Security and Safety have formulated a new sys tem to oversee the procurement and use of consumable goods. Accord ing to Hank Ross, director of din ing services, these additional secur ity measures will include locked containers and bins, the accounting for items as they are transferred from the warehouse to the Langone Center, and a closer regulation of who holds keys. The employee who is accused of removing these items from the cafeteria, Jerry Lee Yordy, waived his right to a preliminary hearing on Sept. 6. Based upon his and his defense counsel's decision to waive this hearing, Yordy will face charges of theft and receiving sto len property-- both are determined to be felony 3-- in Union County Court. At a meeting between Yordy, Photo by Ashley Chertkof Tim M urrell leaves Bucknell today after eight year of service to the university in the Office of Security and Safety"
Murrell takes job at,
Butler University,"By Theresa Kane Staff Writer Timothy Murrell ends four years of service to the University as Director of Security and Safety today. Starting Monday, September 17th he begins work at Butler Uni versity in Indianapolis, Indiana in the capacity of Director of Public Safety. According to Murrell, Buck nell is conducting a national search for his replacement. In the mean time Michael Amarante, Patrol Supervisor, will be Acting Director. When asked if someone currently on the Security and Safety staff would be considered for the posi tion, Barry Maxwell, vice-president for administration, stated that there are "" no internal or local candidates."" Murrell says that he has ""enjoyed his time at Bucknell"" and is proud of what has been accom plished in the last four years espe cially the installation of a central ized life-safety alarm system, the publication of crime prevention materials, and improved relations with the Lewisburg police. As Murrell leaves, he says See M U R R E L L , page 2 By Travis Elliott Staff Writer Bucknell University wres tling coach Robert Ferraro was cleared of a worthless check charge at a preliminary hearing held in August. Milton District Justice Wil liam Kear ruled that the prosecu tion had failed to prove that Fer raro, the president o f Decathlon Athletics in Milton, knowingly approved a check for which there were not sufficient funds. According to the testimony of Decathlon employee Jan Clemens, she wrote the $1,300 check at Fer raro's request to BTR Inc. on March 20 to cover back rent due on Decathlon's Milton office. Clemens also testified that sufficient funds were available to cover the check until another employee wrote more checks which could not be covered on March 21. BTR official Richard Bower- sox testified that when the check was returned for insufficient funds, he sent a certified letter to Decath lon, but that letter was returned unopened. Bowersox then notified Milton police Detective Charles Dugan Jr. who subsequently filed the charge against Ferraro. In response to the charge Fer raro said, ""A  false police report was filed by the Milton police, and I intend to find out why."" Bowersox also filed a civil suit on behalf of BTR, Inc. which ended in a judgement against Decathlon for $3,289.50 in past due rent. In a similar suit, Allison of Rochester, Inc. was awarded $747.92 for past due invoices that Decathlon had failed to pay. Fur thermore, Ferraro and Michael Conners, Decathlon co-owner, were named as co-defendants in a civil suit filed by Duane Dotta for $4,054.90 in unpaid invoices. In March of 1988, Ferraro was charged with setting up, main taining, and selling or exposing for sale a lottery numbers game, all in violation of Section 5512 of the Pennsylvania crimes code, a misde meanor of the first degree. The pro gram, which was a fund- raiser for the Bucknell wrestling club, involved the sale of calendars which were informally linked to the Pennsylvania State Lottery. How ever, the case was dismissed when Ferraro relumed the participants' monies and explained that he was unaware o f the illegality of the fund-raising operation. Ferraro has been the wres tling coach at Bucknell for 17 years. In 1986 and again in 1988, he was chosen as coach of the year in the East Coast Conference. In addition, Ferraro posted his 100th win while coaching at Bucknell on Feb. 10,1988. Buffalo Township police force on July 3, Yordy admitted that he had taken items from the then Univer sity Center. According to the statement of probable cause found in the public record, over $8,000 in goods were determined to have been removed by Yordy between March and May 1990. As of May 5, Security and Dining Services had been alerted Yordy had been distributing goods such as bleach, ketchup, olives, and coffee to the Winfield Auction Center and Stahl Sale Galleries in West Buffalo Township. O f this total dollar figure, $4,219 in goods was found stored on Yordy's prop erty in Winfield. Ross was unable to add many particulars to the case as he said he had been away during the time Yordy's arrest But Ross did say that he had noticed increased usage of certain items which were typi cally not depleted at a high rate. "" Finally, I did not know where these items were going or what was happening to them,"" Ross said. These incidences of not being able to account for items were exacerbated by the sheer volume of food and non-food products that is used by Dining Services. Ross esti mated that in food alone Dining Services spends over $1.75 million every year. The new security measures are meant to diminish the possibil ity that persons can casually remove food from the cafeteria as Yordy did. Officer James Middle- ton of Security and Safety stated that "" the procedure put in place will make that type of activity unlikely See T H E F T , page 2"
Recycling program,
enters second phase,"By Bob Minnich Staff Writer The second phase of a cam pus-wide recycling program was implemented this fall. Residents of Hunt, the Gateways, Bucknell West, and freshman residence halls will find recycling bins in and around their buildings. The driving force behind the recycling project is Penny Puska- rich '92, President of Earth Action. She began planning for the project in January, with the help of George Trutt, Physical Plant Supervisor. She stayed on campus this past summer as well. Puskarich worked with faculty, staff, administration, and physical plant employees to imple ment the plan. Puskarich credits the physical plant and custodial staffs for their cooperation. "" They've helped in working out the bugs in the system,"" she said. According to Puskarich, the University is recycling aluminum and steel cans, three colors of glass, plastic milk, soda, and deter gent bottles, office paper, newspa per, and corrugated cardboard. Puskarich stated that know ing the proper way to recycle is important. Glass bottles should be rinsed out and separated into clear, amber, and green piles. Caps need not be taken off plastic containers but newspapers must be separated from the glossy ads that often accompany them. In addition, glue, staples, and tape should be removed from office and desk paper. Phase One of the plan began with recycling efforts at the Lan gone Center, the computer center, See R E C Y C L IN G , page 3"

524-9225,"Ross stated that he had thought that Yordy might have been involved with someone else in his activity. He added, though, that ""the things which were taken were those products which were readily available to him,"" which"
Murrell,"might suggest that he acted alone. Yordy, who has worked for Dining Services since 1982, has not implicated anyone else in his activ ity and has yet to publicly testify beyond his admission before the East Buffalo Township police."

The alarms alert security if an outside door is propped open after hours. Work was begun yesterday in Hunt Hall; eventually every resi dence hall will have these alarms. Also, the alarm monitoring system will soon be changed. Cur rently from 8 A.M. to 4 P.M. the switchboard monitors alarms and from 4 P.M. to 8 A.M. Security and Safety takes on this responsibility. According to Murrell, with the completion of the Rt. 15 underpass will come a full-time dispatching system and the switchboard will be relieved of day-time monitoring duty."

"More campus parking created,",
demand continues to increase,"By Bob Ritter Staff Writer After great anticipation and nine months of delays, the new uphill parking lot behind fraternity row was opened last week, adding 94 student parking spaces and 64 staff spaces. Although the new lot will help case overcrowding, auto mobile registration figures reveal that uphill student parking is still overcrowded. The Office of Security and Safety has issued 545 red parking decals to students residing in Swartz, Kress, Trax and Roberts Halls, while only 358 parking spaces arc available for those stu dents. There arc a total of 154 blue, or open, spaces available in the new parking lot and the stadium lot, but these spaces arc not enough to erase the deficit on the hill. While the total number of Univer sity-controlled student parking spaces on campus exccdes the number of decals issued, Richard McGinnis, associate professor of civil engineering and chairman of the parking committee, noted that this total docs not include on-street parking on campus, including 170 spaces along Moore Avenue. McGinnis explained that these spaces alone ensure that there arc more than enough parking spaces on campus. Despite the problems uphill, McGinnis said that ""no new parking projects are planned at this time,"" since all registered vehicles can be accommodated on campus. The parking committee's first meeting of the semester is scheduled for next week. Among the topics on the agenda, McGinnis said that the relocation of staff parking behind Trax ""is something we should talk about."" When asked about a plan which would switch the 41 staff and service spaces in the Trax lot with the 40 red decal spaces in the new parking lot, McGinnis said, ""That's certainly a possibility, [since] it would add 50 percent to the parking for Kress, Trax and Roberts."" He said such a proposal had not been considered previously because ""we decided not to make any plans until after the opening"" of the new parking lot. McGinnis said the parking committee will also be discussing methods for combatting chronic abusers of campus parking, includ ing the possible use of a ""boot,"" a device which locks onto a car's wheel, preventing the car from being moved. He said the proposal calls for the ""boot"" to be used on vehicles belonging to students with eight or more parking tickets, as well as unauthorized vehicles belonging to freshmen. In extreme cases towing may also be used. McGinnis justified the proposed measures, saying, ""If [students] arc abusing parking privclcgcs, they shouldn't take spaces from someone abiding by the rules."" McGinnis also said that an open forum for the campus community will be held before any changes are finalized. Among other proposals may be a plan to block out a row of parking spaces in Buckncll West nearest to the intramural fields for blue (open) spaces. McGinnis said, ""It really doesn't make sense to have all yellow [spaces] out there"" since visitors to Buckncll West cur rently have no place to park legally."
Air quality forces staff out of Marts,"Photo by Nancy Leon StafT in the finance department have had to relocate to the Chemistry building due to poor air quality. By Natalie Dunlap Problems with the indoor air quality at Marts Hall have caused discomfort for members of the finance department and have led to their relocation to the basement of the Chemistry Building. Two rooms on the fiyst floor of Marts Hall arc the normal loca tion of the finance department. Members of this department were experiencing what Charlotte Han- sclman, manager of financial ser vices, described as ""typical upper respiratory symptoms."" These symptoms included watery eyes, irritated nose, sore throat, sinus headaches, and occasional chest pains. People with previous aller gies generally were affected most by the air in this area of Marts. Hansclman, who experi enced these discomforts herself, said that approximately 12 of the 15 members of the finance depart ment experienced some form of these symptoms. Generally the symptoms were ""short-lived,"" and once out of that area of the build ing, people did not suffer any discomfort. At this point, the source of the indoor air quality problem remains unknown. Dennis Hawley, assistant director of the physical plant, is coordinating the investiga tions in Marts Hall. Three different indoor air quality consultants have looked into the situation. Such steps such as changing air filters, adjusting air flow, and putting more fresh air into that section of the building have been attempted. Most recently, experts have looked for microbiological growth in the air and are now waiting for the results of these tests. Hansclman is pleased that ""all steps have been taken"" in these investigations and that the univer sity as well as other outside organ izations have been ""doing every thing possible"" to find the source of the problem. Barry Maxwell, vice president for administration, also praised the progression of the situation when he commented that ""the finance office staff has been remarkably understanding and cooperative through this frustrat ing process."" While Marts Hall is going through what Hansclman referred to as the ""sick building syn drome,"" the finance department has been temporarily relocated to the lower level of the chemistry building. The offices that can be found there are Student Accounts, the Cashier, the Check Cashing Window, Student Payroll, and the Director of Accounting and Busi ness Services."
Recycling,"From page 1 and various offices. This falls efforts encompass Phase Two. Phase Three will further expand the program to include fraternities. Phase Four will involve uphill resi dence halls. Trutt says that Puskarich will continue as the student repre sentative meeting with students, resident assistants, and the Intcr- Fratcmity Council to help the Buckncll community recycle properly. According to Trutt, the main aim of the program is to decrease the amount of trash generated by the University and to comply with Act 101, a Pennsylvania law man dating that municipalities and insti tutions like Buckncll begin recy cling efforts. The program currently costs the university money, but in the long run the funds collected from the recyclable goods and the money saved in gar bage hauling costs will more than make up for it. Buckncll generates 1700 tons of trash a year, enough to fill Davis Gym twice. The University pays $42/ ton to haul the trash away, amounting to a total of over $70,000/ year. Puskarich stated that with a successful plan, the amount of trash could decrease by as much as thirty percent. Both Puskarich and Ben Marsh, Associate Professor of Geography, urge everyone to beware of packaging when shop ping. According to Marsh, a com mon misconception is that ""you can do anything as long as you recycle."" Marsh and Pushkarich suggested that as consumers we beware of products that are over- packaged and buy ones that do not have several layers of wrapping. Bringing canvas bags to the book store and grocery store is a simple way to avoid non-biodcgradablc bags. Puskarich received praise from Trutt and Marsh for her work in the project. Marsh stated that ""Penny did an extraordinary job in helping the University."" He also praised the ""impressive coopera tion from the University."" Puskarich said that first year students are cooperating with the program. She said society as a whole must change its attitude and Laura Landsiedel/The Bucknellian Newspaper, glass, plastics and aluminum cans are all included in the University's recycling program. adopt a new set of ""three R's"" : reduce waste, reuse products, and recycle.

Electrical fires strike,
SAE and 7th St. House,"By Tara G. Gilligan An electrical fire reported at 6:45 a.m. on Aug. 20 damaged the walls and ceiling of the kitchen at Sigma Alpha Epsilon. The fire was attributed to an over-loaded extension cord, used to plug in two industrial-size kitchen appliances. Because the fire broke out several weeks before the start of school, no students were present at the time of the fire. Jim McCormick, Director of Safety, said the extension cord, which was attached to both an upright freezer and an industrial refrigerator, melted, starting the fire. Firemen extinguished the blaze before it spread to other parts the house. Costs of the damage are not available. The university and the Sigma Alpha Epsilon chapter are currently discussing who will pay for damages. Because the fire was not caused by faulty wiring, McCormick said, ""I think the fra ternity should be held responsible for any damages; replacing any equipment that was lost."" Chris Daniels, president of SAE, said, ""Right now we're working with the university just to take care of the slight damage."" Daniels expressed concern over the safety of students in the fraternity. ""What we're concerned about is just the wiring in the kitchen,"" he said. According to Gerry Com- merford, Assistant Dean for Hous ing, the fire was not the result of deficient wiring in the building. ""The university has a premium on safety. All of our buildings arc up to date, and all of the wiring is up to date,"" he said. In addition to the fire at SAE, the university has been plagued by other minor electrical fires. A fire which broke out on Apr. 20 in a third floor bedroom at the Seventh Street House also resulted from an overworked extension cord. Electrical fires such as these are not new to the campus. According to McCormick, an aver age of five or six electrical fires break out on campus each year. McCormick cited a number of causes for these electrical fires. ""We can run the whole gambit: smoking in bed, the use of candles, unattended pots on a stove,"" McCormick said, listing a few of the causes of dormitory fires. No students have been hurt in any of the campus fires. In the event of a fire, sprinkler systems in all of the buildings would be acti vated. All residential buildings with wood rooms arc equipped with up to date smoke detectors and sprinklers. Both McCormick and Com- merford have worked on programs to reduce the threat of fire. During the summer, the university sent students a list of appliances, such as toaster ovens and microwaves, to leave at home. Commcrford said ""the safety and security are only as good as the people living in the facilities. Our staff can only do so much."" The first step in reducing the number of fires, McCormick said, would be to ""stop cooking in our rooms. No cooking appliances in the rooms."" ""We do fire safely inspec tions throughout the course of the year,"" Commcrford said. But because students know about the inspections in advance, they arc not entirely effective, according to Commcrford. He said that many students remove cooking appli ances from their rooms prior to the inspection. mittce arc sponsoring a concert on September 21 from 4:30 to 8:00 P.

The two German govern ments stated that Germany will not develop nuclear weapons.

After a meeting with Presi dent F.W. dcKlerk, Mandela said that he may reverse the ANC's decision against an armed struggle. Members of the Zulu tribe, loyal to chief Mangosuthu Bulhe- lczi, are fighting ANC supporters, mostly members of the Xhosha tribe. The six weeks of fighting have left 34 killed."

Democrats want to raise taxes on the wealthiest Americans, while Republicans and the administration want a capital gains tax cut, which would increase revenue. Democrats counter that it would raise revenue by encouraging stock and real estate transactions, but would cost the federal government revenue in future years. Furthermore, the capi tal gains cut would benefit wealthy Americans disproportionately. Democrats and Republicans arc working to beat a fiscal dead line approaching in October, after which automatic cuts of $100 bil lion would go into effect."

Policy,"From page 1 sanctions for group viola tions were ""left up in the air"" when the spring semester ended. Because of the urgency to have the policy in effect by this fall, Dunlop opted for group sanctions that would act as a deterrent by revealing the ""exact mag nitude of the consequences."" According to Dunlop, the policy would have been incomplete had the univer sity merely written prohibi tions into the policy without allowing students the benefit of knowing the consequences. This does not preclude another form of group pun ishment as long as there is a system where students arc aware of the consequences for breaking the rules, and as long as President Sojka gives his approval. 160 i 140-"

T.I.P.,"From page 1 ccss, which he said has ""lost sight of the basic principles of Sojka's recommendations."" Later this week, Peeler, academic coordina tor for the residential colleges, said that he would participate in the review process because of ""my obligation to that program."" Peeler, however, attacked the lack of structure in the implemen tation process, citing the ""real dan ger of losing sight of the principles and the goals of the University without constant attention from the steering committee."" [The com plete text of Peeler's letter appears below). Some other TIP members also expressed reservations about the structure of the task force. While Peeler feels the co- chairpersons ""certainly have the best of intentions"", another mem ber explained, ""[Jacobscn-Wcddlc] seems to be trying to steer our committee's focus through 'polite suggestions.'"" Among the 83 members of the University community present at the TIP workshop there were less than a dozen faculty members. Peeler blamed the ""msuffient atten tion to [the faculty's] principles in the recommendations, [causing] a great many to feel rather marginalized."" Two of the principle partici pants in last year's review process had paid little attention to the TIP process, but echoed Peeler's com ments about faculty involvement. George Jcnks, collection develop ment librarian and the author of the faculty motion to abolish the Greek system, said, ""I don't suppose much is going to happen, but I think they're trying to get many to participate. There's not great enthusiasm, [since] the whole pro cedure is counter to what the faculty wanted."" Steve Becker, chairman and associate professor of physics, also an outspoken critic of the Sojka recommendations, said that ""the faculty arc loo busy doing other things."" Becker went on to say that the Trustees ""are meddling in cam pus affairs, [since they] shouldn't be approving detailed recommendations."" Speaking about the faculty members who stayed away from the workshop, Skcna said, ""It's unfortunate we don't have their opinions to hear, [but] 1 don't ques tion their dedication to the Univer sity. They also realize that by not getting involved it will be easier to comment on the implementation plan."" Sojka stressed the importance of the TIP task force, alluding to adage that ""Tomorrow may never come, [and] I hope you, like me, arc beginning to realize that."" How ever, Sojka was also quick to stress the opportunities that the task force has, calling the process ""an extraor dinary opportunity, an opportunity not to get by, not to smooth things out, not to take care of business... but an opportunity to make Buck- ncll a university for other universi ties to emulate."" Sojka explained that the problems that the University is dealing with arc the same problems that plague society as a whole. ""Social intcrractions are the one area where we seem to make no real progress... The social problems that bedevil humanity today are the same ones we dealt with in the cave, and you have an opportunity [to change them]."" Sojka went on to describe the TIP task force as ""hands on social science."" Jacobsen echoed Sojka's tone by stressing the uni versity's ""goals for the develop ment of students as total persons... [who] have some awareness of value that will in fact make society a better place."""

Objections to TIP voiced,"Dear Charlotte Jacobsen Weddle: I want to express as clearly as I can my principal concerns with the TIP process. First, as I said Sunday, the structure of the implementation process carries the grave danger of losing sight of the underlying princi ples that should be served (i.c. the mission and goals of the university, the principles articulated by Gary Sojka in his report to the Board (adopted by the Board)). I am not sure, with an essentially toothless steering committee, that we will get the kind of rigorous, careful thinking that is necessary here. Second, I think the constitution of the task groups is likely, in at least some cases, to lead to proposals calculated to vitiate or indeed eviscerate the purposes of the President's proposals. There is no assurance at all that advocates of fundamental change will have an adequate voice in some of these groups. The Steering Committee has no authority; it is left to the president alone to assure that the reforms really serve their osten sible purposes. The idea that students should be principally responsible for redesigning the social/rcsidcntial life that students have largely shaped heretofore docs not serve the mission of the university very well. How can we expect these same students, unaided by us, to produce anything better? Are we not educators? Finally, I am very concerned that the procedure you project allows no opportunity to cither the BSG or the Faculty for input. The report simply goes to the President. I would urge that a step be added, prior to the report to the President And in the same vein, I would urge that we go beyond the annual report mechanism to provide for a full view of the situation after three or four years.

Student center survives the test of time,
"Since its construction, the former",
UC has been a big topic of conversation.,"By Sue Basalla Staff Writer For many of us, the renaming of the University Center as the Elaine Langone Center last spring seemed redundant and ridiculous. ""What's wrong with calling it the UC?"" we asked. ""We can't just start saying 'Langone Center' when it's the same old place!"" After all of these years, who's going to say, ""Yea, I stopped off at the Langone Center to get my mail?"" It just doesn't sound right. And so we kept calling that cornerstone of our campus, that hub of our hometown, that essential everyday edifice, the ""UC."" Nobody could stop us. You'd think that we'd built the place ourselves and Elaine was trying to steal the credit. But now, back on campus after summer vacation, we hear the new freshmen (those misguided youths) actually using the new name in sentences like, ""I think the biology lab is in the basement of the Langone Center."" Suddenly, we realize that in a few years everyone will be saying ""Langone Center"" and call us old fogeys for clinging to the out-dated ""UC."" Why do we care if a 20 year- old building is renamed? Obvi ously, we (like all humans) resist change. So imagine how the cam pus reacted to the construction of the UC in the first place. Seeing the grassy hill on the comer of Moore Avenue and 7th Street taken over by a hulking brick monster wasn't a simple transition for the Bucknel- lians of the 60's and 70's. Everyone agreed that a cam pus center was needed, but when it was completed in 1970, not every one approved of the building itself. B.U.C. (Before the Univer sity Center), the Bison squatted next to Vcddcr, the Bookstore crowded itself into Carnegie and three cafeterias stretched across Lartson, Swartz and Cooley Halls. Most of the Kress art collection hung in the Bertrand Library. The various clubs and committees took refuge in the dimly lit comers of dormitories and class buildings. Yet, this new all- cncompassing campus center was not received without some trepida tion. According to George Jenks, librarian at the time of construction, the new University Center was described by a professor of his acquaintance as architecturally sim ilar to ""an Albanian railway sta tion."" Others suggested that paint ing the UC arches golden would complete the building's resem blance to a McDonald's. As time passed, however, people grew accustomed to the UC. Jim Hammerlee, director of student activities during the early years of the UC, commented that it was ""the first major building on campus with a different kind of architecture. At first there was some feeling that the new building intruded, but now it is generally well-received."" Within a few years, the name Langone will grow familiar and smooth on our tongues, just as the UC building's harsh edges have blended into the background of grassy hills. Time will take care of it all...until the biology building is finished. Courtest of University Archives"

Masonry and student life,
"""All of us are going to be bricks",
"as we work to implement the trustee's plan""",
--  Ed Dadez,"Bricks. We arc all bricks. Bricks in a process that is to give ""vitality and beauty to this master plan [of a University system]"" in the words of Charlotte Jacobsen Weddle. Bricks arc regular, hard, consistent and inanimate objects. Bricks don't vary too much on the whole. They're heated and molded into the desired shape. Bricks are commonplace and dull. Bricks lack imagination, they're all the same size and shape. But best of all, bricks all fit nicely into place. Trustee Implementation Planning (TIP) is all about bricks it seems -- and their mason. It's about homoge neity, regularity and a good, tight fit. Our social-residential system, one of the most significant aspects of student life at our fine University, is being shaped. It's being molded to fit a blueprint and it's been assigned a specific time schedule. The future of student life at Buckncll, a university in it's second century, is being determined in six short months. Participation in this grand scheme is by the few: the fraternity and sorority presidents, representatives from the offices of Student and Residential Life, delegates from Buckncll Student Government (BSG) and a handful of interested students, alumni and neighbors from the Lcwisburg community. A nice grouping of truly concerned individuals, but not a representative group of all of the concerns on this campus. Where are the throngs of students that paraded around campus last semester? Where are those that marched on the Academic Quad or compiled reports on the ""isms"" of our flawed system? Have you forgotten the cause that you were fighting for? After a full house in Vaughan Literature Auditorium last semester, fewer than a dozen members of the faculty arc involved in TIP. Where has the concern of the faculty gone? What happened to their genuine effort to ""improve"" our University? Inaction, they must know, speaks for itself. Most faculty don't want their hands sullied by such work. ""If it can't be my way, I will have no part,"" they are saying. They have washed their hands of the problems and their concerns with our social-residential system. They have given up and moved on. What then arc we left with? What is TIP? TIP is made up of the few, only the most concerned. Those will ing to offer their time and input on an issue that should be very dear to our community. But without all compo nents of our community represented, without all of the data and points of view available, how can TIP be expected to satisfy all of those who arc and will be affected? Instead of becoming involved, many students and faculty have turned a blind eye. Instead of working within the system to effect change, they have chosen not to participate, leaving the task of recreating a social/ residential system at Buckncll to the mason and her bricks."

"Senior questions Gift Drive,",
chairman Daniels responds,"Dear Chris: I really appreciated getting the letter concerning the Senior Gift Drive. I'm glad to hear some body is doing something for Buck ncll. If I were to give money to this wonderful cause, what in the world would it be spent on? What's the purpose of this Gift Drive? Who's going to benefit, and in what ways? How is this a class project, and why should I contribute? I think that you did not include very vital aspects of this campaign in your recruitment letter. I will let you know that with out this information I see no reason at all why I should even consider helping or contributing to this effort. Why did your letter state that a steering committee composed of 15 classmates has been established? There arc only 12 listed on the sheet that was included with your letter. Besides, I think that the wording of your letter needed to be more carefully written: ""While financial contributions arc an inte gral aspect of this program..."" If the financial contributions arc not the primary aspect of this program, then what is happening to the money? I'm sorry to be so critical of your letter, but after reading it, it has not informed me of why I should get involved. It only tells me why I shouldn't be involved.

C-3059,"Dear Mike: I would like to express my appreciation for your letter regard ing the Senior Gift Drive. The questions that you have addressed in your letter are legitimate con cerns that many seniors must be asking themselves when they hear about this project. I trust that this letter will provide a better under standing of the Senior Gift Drive and its extraordinary value to the University and local communities. The Senior Gift Drive has become an annual tradition at Bucknell. It was first established 22 years ago when the Class of 1968 raised $12,000 in a 10-year pro gram. At that time, all the money donated was placed in a holding fund. During the 10th year reunion, the class voted on a tangible gift to be donated to Bucknell in the name of their class. Since then, although the tra dition has remained, the program itself has undergone several changes. In 1989, the designation of the gift changed. Rather than placing our money in a holding fund, it will be given to the Annual Giving Program. The money that is pledged annually will be spent annually. We are now able to choose how our money is spent and to see the immediate results of our gifts. Our donations can be allo cated to any of four funds: The Annual Fund, The Association For The Arts, The Bison Club, and the Engineering Fund. The Annual Fund is used to meet the pressing needs of the University. Money donated to this fund goes toward maintaining the University's prop erty and facilities, scholarship funds, or the addition of computers around campus. The Association For The Arts provides funding for the performing arts endowment, gallery exhibits, the poetry pro gram, or any concert offered to the University and local communities. The Bison Club provides money for Bucknell's athletic programs. It goes toward athletic facilities and the modem equipment available to students free of charge, recruiting, and team travel. Those who choose to donate to this fund may specify that their money goes to a specific sport For example, if I want to donate to women's soccer, I may do so. The Engineering Fund is used to update and improve the College of Engineering. The field of engineering is constantly chang ing and new equipment must be purchased to maintain the high quality of education in the depart ment. The money that we pledge and eventually donate over the next five years will be factored into the budget of the fund we specify. On a more personal note, Bucknell University has provided us with an outstanding education. We will always cherish the friend ships we've made, as well as the opportunities for personal growth and achievement which Bucknell has provided us. To Michael and the rest of my classmates, I hope I've provided an adequate explana tion of the Senior Gift Drive and trust that you will give back to a place that gave you so much.

Freshman speaks out,
on sexism and racism,"Dear Editor: Here we arc at Buckncll Uni versity in the year 1990; going into the twenty-first century, and we are still perpetrating racism and sex ism. I thought that the reason we came to this fine institution was to get the best education possible, so that our generation could make a difference. Maybe at this point I need to define ""Education."" The American Heritage Dictionary says that to educate is ""(1) To provide with esp. formal schooling; teach. (2) To stimulate or develop the mental or moral growth of."" Let me also define the word moral: ""(1) Of or concerned with the discernment or instruction of what is good and evil. (2) Being or acting in accordance of good behavior. (3) Arising from con science. (4) Having psychological rather than tangible effects."" We came here to learn how to become the next leaders of this country, but the behaviors and alti tudes we display arc that of ignor ant people. The following examples will depict what I am referring to. The majority of the students, Amer ican and foreign, walk past each other for three and four years with out giving each other a ""smile"" or even saying ""hello."" Do you think this is leadership material? In the cafeteria, we sit at the same tables with each other and rudely exclude other races and sexes of people from joining into general conversa tions. Do you think this is leader ship material? We purposely refuse to give eye contact to those who are making an effort to be friendly or to speak, pretending that they are not there or that we don't see them. When you do things like that, it shows how ersatz you really are, and it bums the hell out of me. I am a Freshman here at Buckncll University, and on many occasions I have been made to feel like I did not belong because of my race and sometimes because of my gender. There is a perpetuating dis play of separatism on this campus that needs to cease immediately. This is not adult behavior, nor is it the behavior of any person who is learning to become a professional in any field. The only thing that you will learn from this type of behavior is how to become a good twenty-first century bigot. My tuition is the same as everyone else here. My class assignments are made the same as everyone else here, and my goals arc the same as everyone else here, that is to get ""my degree."" We do not have to love each other, but we must respect each other, and live together while we are here. It is possible for me to learn from you, and for you to learn from me. Do not let old attitudes and lies stop our ""growth."" We can take a better quality of life to our new communities when we leave here if we start now. Let go of the fear and labels; let us get to know each other and share our experience, strength and hope with each other. It is not necessary to act superior, or think of yourself as being superior, to feel good about yourself. Let us all show some human kindness toward each other. Then go out into the world and make a difference. We are the peo ple who have the opportunity to make sexism and racism a thing of the past So please, listen to your conscience; if you don't have one, try some of my suggestions and you will develop one. I implore you, to let the buck of hatred and indifference stop here. Juarrannetta McNabb '94 September 8,1990 September 14, 1990 Bucknellian page 9"

Bison Tales,"- \ By Peter Lalos and Marc Haimes Here I am sedately standing in line waiting to be fed while making sure no one from the elevator tries to sleaze in without waiting; and you know, there is something about owning an ID card that really scares me. Of course I have a lot of lime to contemplate the matter now because this particular caf line seems to be moving along with the same rapid momentum as Great Aunt Agnus (the one with the walker) the time I tried to help her across Route 70.. . But that incident happened a long time ago, and the Mack truck company did settle out of court. I just wish I hadn't left my key chain with the handy card holder attachment in the emergency room that day, because later on at dinner I discov ered I was missing something very, very impor tant ..... (Windchimes and flashback theme). So there wc arc in line at the caf discussing schedules and making conspicuous glances at this one girl who was so hot that the other day at Play fair, she received a standing ovation without even requesting one. At last the time came for me to present my vital card, so it could be run through that little slider thingcc. Right pocket empty, left pocket.. . . No, that's my Bison Beverage Buster, it's not here! I've lost my student I.D. (the first four notes of Beethoven's fifth strike in the background)! I pleasantly explained my situation to Bertha, the jolly woman working the machine, while my Playfair scope rolled her eyes and resorted to perus ing her ""What's Happening"" for the third time. I politely asked Bertha if just this once, considering I was on a 7-3 meal plan, she could be so kind as to let me pass by. Well, Bertha looked at me as if I had neglected to place my tray in every second bin on the conveyor belt, and coldly stated that if I didn't have my ID, she needed cash. Otherwise I should quit holding up the line and get lost Me: (reaching into pocket): Will I get the money back?"" Bertha: (sighing): Do you know your social security number? Me: (shifting nervously): Well uh. . . 215- 11... 215-11...I kind of forgot it, but I'll still get my money back, right? Bertha: (after two minutes of hysterical laughter): Not. Humbled, I handed over all my money (including the dollar I had been saving for the Wednesday night showing of ""Steel Magnolias""), slouched through the door, and took the first drip ping wet tray that popped up. . . a RED one (Bee thoven's fifth is again heard off in the distance). I quickly began piling food on my tray in an effort to catch up to my group. You know, for six bucks you would think they'd let me get stuffed shells AND ""chicken"" nuggets at the same time. After deciding on the shells and taking a small salad with lettuce, ham, and tomato, but no cheese, I grabbed two or three dozen shot-glass size drinking cups and proceeded to fill them with various juices and sodas (its always a culture shock going home for the holidays and having to drink just one bever age out of one normally-sized container). Then I picked up my utensils along with fifty or sixty nap kins and went over to the salad dressing bar. You ever wonder why they have a salad dressing bar, but no salad bar? I tried to get close enough to the ""light"" Italian dressing (or was that chocolate sauce? I never can tell) to scoop some on my salad without making a mess; unfortunately some jerk had plopped a huge tray of food down on the ledge right by the dressing bins and gone off in search of an extra pat of butter, blocking everyone's access to the drcssing/chocolate sauce (I'm still not sure yet). After a few minutes of contorting my body into various positions in vain efforts to get at the ladle, I gave up and went to sit down. But WHAT'S THIS?!? WHERE THE HELL DID MY FRIENDS GO, WHERE ARE THEY?!?! I clutched my tray, eyes searching wildly, as millions of people turned to note my lost expression and the fact that I was.. . ALONE! Okay, keep calm, start walking down an aisle, and LOOK like you know where you're going; keep an car out for them in case they're call ing me. I CAN'T FIND THEM!!! God, I must look so stupid right now... I was squinting so hard during this futile search for my friends that I failed to notice another tray-carrying student who had also been ditched. He was trying to break the land speed record in circling the perimeter of the caf, praying that his friends (who were already cutting into their cream of broc coli soup) would notice him. He didn't see me either. Unknowingly, I backed toward him... Una ware, he came directly at me. Then it happened, I tuuut ........... To be continued... V_"

Environmental problems,
need more than rhetoric,"By Mary Smolka Earlier this summer, I was flipping around the channels on the T.V., and came across a rather interesting program on VH1. It wasn't a program, really--more like a thirty minute political com mercial. Clips of stars talking about the environment were mixed in with pictures of oil spills, contami nated beaches and smog. Every few minutes you were told to ""Vote against pollution. Vote for the Big Green."" At first, I was glad to sec that stars were cither, since the program never mentioned exactly what the ""Big Green"" was, or what it entailed. This lack and distortion of facts seemed to characterize the entire program. I remember one spokesman saying in his ""your- childrcn-will-dic-of-cancer-if-you- don't-do-this"" voice, ""Remember, if you're over 21, vote for the ""Big Green."" Over 21? As I recall, 18 year olds were given the right to vote almost a generation ago. Why should wc trust their facts on envi ronmental damage when they can't even get the voting age right? ducers of this show would have you think. Vote for the ""Big Green"" and all your environmental problems will be solved. To really clean up the earth, we're going to need a lot more than empty rhetoric. We're going to need action. Co-operative action. Instead of telling people to go it on their own, celebrities should encourage the public to work with the scientists and engineers who have the background to understand the technical effects of pollution. Pollution became such a problem in the first place because . of a lack of encouraging people to exer cise their right to vote. For whatever rea son, people look up to singers _________ and actors, and trust them more than they trust the ordinary Joe. I was heartened by the fact that these stars would use their fame and rec ognition to encourage civic responsibility. But the more I watched, the more disappointed I became. This was not an intelligent, political dis course--it was an appeal to your emotions, plain and simple. This is fine if you're picking out china pat terns, but when it come to dealing with highly complex issues such as the environment, a simple ""We're good, you're bad"" isn't going to do anyone any good. Who among us is going to stand up and say ""I love pollution! Soil my beaches! Destroy my lungs! Build a toxic waste dump in my backyard! Please!"" No one, of course. So, we're agreed. Pollution is bad, clean is good. Where do we go from there?"" That's the question this pro gram failed to answer, except to say ""Vote for the Big Green."" And this wasn't much of an answer"
...when it comes to dealing with highly com,
"plex issues such as the environment, a sim",
"ple ""We're good, you're bad"" isn't going to",
do anyone any good.,"""It's lime to stop listening to the so-called 'experts' and start tak ing care of the environment our own way,"" Jane Fonda suggested. I would like to suggest to her that one of the true hallmarks of a wise person is knowing when one is in over one's head. Yes, there arc many things that ordinary citizens can do that will make the world a cleaner place; however, many of the problems wc face arc complex and technical, and require a certain amount of technical knowledge to even understand, much less unravel. But that's not what the pro information. Nobody knew that prolonged exposure to chemicals could be harmful. Nobody knew that unlincd landfills could leak contaminants to surrounding groundwater. Nobody knew that there was a threshold amount of garbage the world could absorb before it began fighting back. Lack of information and knowledge caused the problem of environmental damage. It is only by increasing our knowledge and disseminating our information to all sectors that we can meet the chal lenges the environment presents us. Editor's note: Mary Smolka '90 is employed by Eli Lilly in Indianapo lis as an environmental engineer."

Parent attacks University's administration,"Dear President Sojka: This letter is being addressed to you as you have made it very clear, over the past four years, that you arc the sole responsible person on the Buckncll campus for any and all matters pertaining to academic excel- _____ lcnce, social life, tenure and promotion, fund raising, ad nau seam. In my opinion, the uni- ---- versity would have been better served if you had persevered mag nificently at the traditional role of a college president: a fund raiser. No, you have to become embroiled in a tenure dispute with the Economics Department. Your redeeming grace is that you appear to be an advocate for the student as opposed to the ball and chain that is your Vice President for Student Life, Dr. Jacobsen. My son, Brian I.

I think it was brilliant beyond mag nificence your choice of a week day evening, an evening that a not- so-wcalthy working parent paying for tuition could find a burden to attend. Knowing the pitiful endow ment that Buckncll is heir to, I trust that the turn-out was small enough to avoid unnecessary expense.

Yes. I feel so fortunate that I quit teaching on the college level 18 years ago, because if Buckncll is any example, the level of higher education and its administration and teaching and respect for its students has regressed and, judging from the pathetic attempt at a graduation cer emony, that fine art has made no advances either. Am I - proud that my son has gradu ated from Buck ncll University?

Freshman,
Forum,"By Richard Polt and James Joseph A wise man once said that a body whose voice remains unheard for too long will inevitably lose its power of speech. In giv ing the freshmen a forum through which they can be heard we have chosen not to remain silent. This is the first of many commentaries which will be published weekly under a designated freshmen col umn. In addition to expressing our personal opinions, wc hope to articulate the views of the Class of 1994. As Buckncll University faces a new decade, a plethora of poli cies and ideas will be considered and actually implemented. Immersed in this flux of ideas and opinions, we feel that wc arc a ""transition"" class subject to the decisions of the administration and the upperclassmen. Upon the announcement of new proposals and plans, the students who compose the Class of '94 cannot be caught tongue-tied. It is true that freshmen lack the insight and experience to change campus policy. However, in an environment where wc total one quarter of the undergraduate population, our voice needs to be heard. By varying the subject matter and tone of this column from week to week, we hope to cover many aspects of campus life. Among these topics are student parking, the lack of freshman auto mobile privileges, the Greek system, as well as issues outside of Buckncll. The intent of our column is not to condemn school related issues, but to critique them in a constructive fashion. Though we have been here for only two weeks, wc have already found a host of topics on which wc are eager to write. If there arc any particular issues which you would like us to address, please contact cither of us through The Bucknellian. Wc would appreciate any feedback you wish to share during the coming weeks. Our long journey together begins now. force upperclassmen into repetition because there can be no compro mise. Just possibly, the Dean will remember my son's rather irate reaction. Will I recommend Bucknell University to a future applicant? Only if he/she is majoring in engi neering and even then I wish him/ letter? I want no more communica tions from Bucknell University. I want no more ""money begs."" (Less than two weeks from graduation I receive a ""beg"" from something called Bucknell Parents or some such organization.) I'm afraid the notion of having to continue to pay Buckncll for the ""privilege"" of my son's degree is more than normally offensive to me. No more ""wouldn't I be interested in partici pating in."" Just like you world renowned place- _____ ment service, parent skill input question naires, etc., please don't bother-they #-- don't work. I particularly never want to be exposed to the inane written mewlings of Dr. Charlotte Jacobsen. In my opinion, the woman is embarrassment to her position, and every student I've spoken to agrees. OOPS! I forgot. Students don't count. Gordon R. Caudill June 25,1990"

Improvisational artist holds workshop,--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our Man-Made 9de(C,"By Ashley Shrader This week the Bucknell Department of Theatre and Dance and the Bucknell Association for the Arts hosted guest improvisa tional artist Richard Bull to help kick off the departments' new Improvisational/Movcmcnt for Actors course. Bull has spent the past week working with the Buck nell Dance Company and other theatre and dance students in com position, jazz, modem dance, and TH393 Seminar in Contemporary Performance. The grand finale of this residency will be a joint improvisational dance concert with the five-member Richard Bull Dance Theatre (Cynthia Novack, George Russell, Vicki Kurtz, Sally Souders, and Richard Bull). The concert will be held in Tustin Stu dio Theatre today, at 5:00 p.m. (admission is free). Bull also worked with the Bucknell Dance Company and utilized improvisa tional techniques which will lead to a piece slated for the company's Fall Dance Concert. Richard Bull began his professional life as a jazz pianist, and then turned to dance as a per former, choreographer, and direc tor. He has also worked as an edu cator at New York University, SUNY Brockport, and Wesleyan University. The Richard Bull Dance Theatre is a company of danccr/actors who work with chore ographic and theatrical improvisa tion. In daily rehearsals movement ideas and textual concepts are explored, developed, and eventu ally organized into scenarios which become repertory works. Spontane ity and invention continue even when a work is ""finished,"" and no two concert performances of the same work are identical. The pro cess is very much like the process used in jazz music. Audiences share in the exciting immediacy of this creative, interactive experi ence. So, if you arc not participat ing on stage, you can still become an integral part of this unique per formance today at 5:00 p.m. in Tus tin Studio Theatre. courtesy of Doan Ann McAdams Improvisational artist Richard Bull worked with the students of TH393 this past week. Bull was hosted by the Department of Thea tre and Dance and the Bucknell Association for the Arts.

Dante Painters featured in Gallery,"The works of five major American abstract painters will be exhibited in Bucknell University's Center Gallery Sept. 14 to Oct. 28. ""Primal Denouements: The Dante Painters,"" features the works of Linda Gentile, Peter Pinchbeck, Richard Pugliese, Edwin Ruda and Joe Walcntini, artists who meet weekly at New York's Cafe Dante. According to Robert Metz ger, Center Gallery director, the five artists have been influenced by the philosophy of French writer Mcrlcau-Ponty, who saw painting as an expression of vision and existence. ""Merleau-Ponty was a phi losopher who wrote that painters see not only the object they're painting, but they see themselves while they're painting,"" said Metz ger. ""In other words, the painter is a part of the painting."" Metzger is working with the Pennsylvania State University's Philosophy Department to present the exhibit. In addition, an interdis ciplinary panel discussion featuring the artists and philosophers Vero- nique Foti, Glen Mazis, Edward Casey, Galen Johnson and Gary Shapiro will be held Friday, Sept. 14, at 8 p.m. in the Langonc Center Gallery Theatre. There will be an opening reception in the Center Gallery immediately following the panel discussion; both events arc open to the public. The exhibit and the panel discussion are part of the 15th annual conference of the Merleau- Ponty Circle at Penn State, Sept. 13-15.

Struggling field hockey looks to improve,"Peter Ho/The Bucknellian The field hockey team has had a shaky start to its season, losing the first three games, including this match against West Chester 3-0. attacks, West Chester's Celeste Williams scored with six minutes remaining to provide the Rams' first score. Throughout the second half the Rams' defense blanketed the Lady Bison by not allowing them to establish any sustained offensive opportunities. The one-sidedness that characterized the second half could be seen in the statistics, as West Chester outshot Bucknell 9-3, while also possessing an 11-1 advantage in comers. The Lady Bison were perplexed by the Rams' attack and surrendered the second goal of the game off of a West Chester comer with five minutes remaining. A third Ram score just a minute later put the game out of reach for the Bison. Saturday, Bucknell traveled to play former East Coast Confer ence rival Hofstra. Though the Lady Bison again played strong at the outset of the game, the Lady Dutchmen scored a 1-0 victory. The Lady Bison's only let down came in the first half, when they gave up a penalty stroke to Hofstra. Kristen Cipullo sent the ball past a sprawling Ward into the back of the net, giving Hofstra a lead they would never relinquish. Coach Averill felt the game ""should've been a Bucknell win."" Bucknell will travel to the nation's capital this weekend, look ing to notch their first win after three consecutive setbacks tomor row when they face American University. Sunday the Lady Bison will take on Georgetown, an old rival who should prove to provide a for midable challenge for Bucknell, as they hope to crack the win column for the first time in 1990. carried into halftime. Although Bucknell played impressively to start the second half, they could not convert any offensive attacks into scores. Mich igan State turned the momentum into their favor by hounding the Lady Bison with their tenacious style of play. With ten minutes remaining, the Spartans got the break they were looking for. State's Sharon Hill pushed her pass across the goalmouth to teammate Brigid Kiley, who followed through for the goal, knotting the game at 1-1. The Spartans quickly capitalized again on a shocked Bucknell squad, as Lisa Besser shuffled one past Lady Bison goalie Danielle Ward '93 in a chaotic moment following a comer pass for what turned out to be the winning score. The Lady Bison, however, quickly regrouped and pushed the ball deep into the Michigan State zone with a resurgent offensive counterattack. Less than three min utes remained when the Spartans jeopardized their lead by giving up a penalty stroke to Bucknell. Sweeper Katrina Mueller '93 aimed for the comer and let go on one her patented rocket shots, but the shot careened just outside the post ena bling the Spartans to hang on for the win. Bucknell coach Jen Averill commented, ""We dominated this game, we just could not take advan tage of all the opportunities we had."" The Lady Bison came into their September 6 match against the West Chester, looking to avenge last year's shutout loss to the Rams, but West Chester again proved to be too much for the Lady Bison, as Bucknell fell 3-0. Bucknell looked to assert themselves early on, but once again found themselves dead locked in a midfield game. After both defenses weathered opposing By Scooter Van Kirk and Julie McCausland Staff Writers The Bucknell women's field hockey team this year will feature an extraordinary amount of youth, returning no players with more than two seasons of college experience. But last year's graduation did little to dissolve the Lady Bison's nucleus of starters, co-captained by Jeanette Aurand '92 and Meghan Clark '92. Bucknell will also be supplemented with seven talented freshman, many of whom will be major contributors this fall."

Experience guides volleyball,"Laura Landsledel/The Bucknellian The women's soccer team, recognized this year as a varsity sport for the first time, hopes to improve with experience."
W om en's soccer,
earns varsity status,"By Todd Bianchine Staff Writer The women's volleyball team is putting the frustration that went along with last year's 2-26 overall record behind them, and they are bringing a positive attitude along with a new coach and new league into the 1990 season. Coach Cindy Opalski, who in four years at Clarion University compiled an overall record of 92- 46 and one league championship, will be at the helm replacing former coach, Vicki May. The Lady Bison will also be participating in the Patriot League this year as it begins its first full season of play. ""We played most of the teams that are in the conference last year,"" said Kara Forosisky '92. ""We know we're a good team and we should do real well in the league."" Coach Opalski has a young but experienced squad, as the Lady Bison lost only one player to gradu ation last year. Among the starters for Opalski this season are co captains Kristin Colbert '91 at mid dle hitter and Forosisky at outside hitter. ""As captains Kristin and I try to set an example on the court and in practice. We serve as role mod els for the other players and we just try and keep everyone motivated and focused,"" said Forosisky. The other starters include setter Dee Scinta '92, who was named to the Colonial League All- Tournament team last fall, Kath leen Sullivan '92 at middle hitter, Sarah Mcsaros '93 at outside hitter, and Mary Jordan '93 at right side hitter. When the Lady Bison need the big play on defense, Tammy Windfelder '92 and Lori Ludwick '94 will be called on as the team's defensive specialists. Rounding out the team are juniors Meghan Kin ney and Stacy Sontheimer, and freshmen Jen Carter and Colleen Conway, who will look for playing time in their first season of play. Last weekend the team trav eled to Loyola to participate in the Lady Greyhounds preseason tour nament. Bucknell fell to the host team 15-4,7-15,15-2,15-6. Forosi sky led the team with seven kills and one block, while Mesaros served up three aces in the defeat. The situation did not improve in the team's second match, as Cleveland State rolled to a three games to none victory over the Lady Bison. Bright spots were the performances of Colbert, who posted 10 kills, and Forosisky, who put down nine. Play improved for the Lady Bison in their third match as they shut down St. Francis 15-9, 15-11, 15- 10. The team combined for 35 kills, led by Forosisky's nine, and 11 aces, of which Mesaros had five. Scinta had a total of 67 assists in the tournament, 30 in the St. Fran cis match. ""I thought we did well see ing as how they were our first matches of the season,"" states Foro sisky. ""We're still juggling the lineup to see what works."" The Lady Bison will get a chance to avenge their losses to Loyola and Cleveland State as Bucknell will hold its annual invita tional tournament this weekend. Other teams in the tournament include St. Francis and Rider Uni versity. The matches will start Fri day at 6 p.m., and conclude on Saturday. Wholesome Foods O' Ultamlns innondine Toys"

The Bucknellian,
x-1520,"by Anne Taback The Bucknell women's soc cer team made history last Thurs day when they played Dickinson College in their first ever varsity game. Despite the loss of that game, and the loss of the following game to Bloomsburg University, Head Coach Toby Lovccchio was not discouraged. According to Lovccchio, when dealing with a team that had an excellent record last year as a club, the main adjust ment for returning players is a mental one. With a club sport, explained Coach Lovecchio, the players ""don't have to be as seri ous, whereas when you become a varsity sport, you have to take it seriously."" Lovecchio also feels that there is ""more competition,"" and that ""coming from a club sport to a varsity team they need all the help they can get, but I know they won't give up."" After all, ""the tran sition won't happen overnight."" In the September 6 game against Dickinson, the Lady Bison fell behind early when the Red Devils scored at 5:12 in the first half, and again early in the second half. The Lady Bison closed the lead to one goal when Christine Fields '94 scored off an assist from Amy Krause '91. However, at 85:53, Dickinson scored again and went on to win the game by a 3-1 margin. Bridget Collins '94, started in net for Bucknell, and made fourteen saves. Kim Fekel '93 came off the bench to relieve Collins, and made five saves. On September 8, the Lady Bison lost their second game of the season to Bloomsburg by a score of 4-1. Midfielder Christina Baselga '91 scored the only goal of the game for Bucknell on a sec ond period penalty kick. Fekel played a strong game in net, recording 22 saves. Although it is Bloomsburg's first varsity season as well, Lovccchio commented that ""they played like they'd been a varsity team for awhile."" But the coach also added that following the one day of practice between games the team ""improved tremen dously, although the score wasn't evident of that. The ladies showed confidence."" He added that ""they played as well as I expected, and beyond. After that game they felt that they'd played better than Thursday."" The team hopes this confi dence will carry into tomorrows game against Delaware. Lovccchio feels that the week of extensive practice between games will help. He said that the Lady Bison will be prepared when they clash with the Blue Hens on Saturday."

From lempiri,
An armchair QB's guide to the NFL,"By M ark Griffith and Eric Smith Staff Writers Can the San Francisco 49crs three-peat as world champions is the most debated question among football fans as the 1990 N FL season begins. Another hot topic is whether an A FC team can even compete in a Super Bow l-let alone win it. This season promises to be interesting as these and other developments will be focused upon in the following five months of football action. Parity appears prominent this year, as we see noteworthy improvements from the Jets, Chargers, Buccaneers, Falcons and Lions. So without further ado, we present our 1990 fearless football forecast (teams listed in projected order of finish): When looking at the A FC East, one has to wonder how the Buffalo Bills will not end up on top. In what has to be the weakest division in the league, Buffalo should cruise to its third consecutive division title. Corne lius Bennett, Bruce Smith and Shane Conlan lead a particularly strong defensive unit. The only question is whether or not quarterback Jim Kelly will live up to the superstar potential that has haunted him throughout his NFL career. The Miami Dolphins only hope is that Dan Marino can aver age five touchdowns per game, because this defense will give up at least four. Without Eric Dickerson for the first six weeks of the season, the Indianapolis Colts will be lucky to win two games during this stretch. Indy will have to rely on its above average defense, and hope for a quick professional adjustment by rookie quarterback Jeff George. Will Blair Thomas be the New York Jets savior? Not with this offensive line. But his addition, as well as off season coaching changes could make the Jets a .500 team. The offensively inept New England Patriots, on the other hand, made no substantial moves since last year's dismal season, and .500 is but a distant dream. The A FC  Central promises to be a Dawg fight with all four teams possessing legitimate shots at playoff berths. The Cleveland Browns should vault back to the top of this division on tough defense and an explosive offense. Bemie Kosar, if healthy, has several weapons in agile receiver Reggie Langhomc and running backs Kevin Mack and Eric Met calf. One can also expect to see the Cincinnati Bcngals in the thick of things at season's end. James Brooks is a proven runner on a powerful offensive squad that will see wild card action in January. Though the Pittsburgh Stcclcrs and Houston Oilers each have wild card chances, both will need offensive help. The dcfcnsc-oricntcd Stcclcrs continue to have a mediocre quarterback controlling the offense. The running duo of Merrill Hoge and Tim Worley will need All-Pro performances to compensate for Bubbyball. Jack Pardee's run-and-shoot in Houston must mature before serious division hopes can be considered. The A F C  West poses a problem, as we have a split decision: one vote goes to the Kansas City Chiefs. Last year's conference- leading defense will pave the way for Marty Schottcnhcimer's gallant return to post-season play. The tandem of rookie Percy Snow and All-Pro Derrick Thomas should give the Chiefs that distinction once again. Although the offense is hampered by an average quarterback, the hard running of Chris tian Okoye will provide the needed offensive punch. Our other prognosti cator goes with the Los Angeles Raiders. The Silver and Black, under coach Art Shell, will play old Raider defense, no matter what city they're in. Combined with the likes of Bo Jackson and the speed of Willie Gault and Tim Brown, the offense will be dynamite. A strong year out of Jay Schrocdcr is all that is needed to lead L.A . to the top of the division. The Denver Broncos must wonder what it takes to win the big one. Low morale will be their downfall. Behind the offensive leadership of John El way and the help of Mile High Stadium, the Broncos will look to a wild-card spot. The San Diego Chargers look to youth in a season that may hold many surprises. A solid defense lead by linebacker Billy Ray Smith and rookie lineman Junior Scau may ambush unsuspecting oppo nents. Offensively the Chargers arc led by QB Billy Joe Tolliver, but with a weak offensive line, scoring will be tough. The Seattle Scahawks arc a tcamsinking fast. A poor offense and a pitiful defense will result in a nightmare. Look for three wins as a milestone. The N FC East is always a tough division with fierce rivalries. Look for the New York Giants to reign supreme. Any defense that has Lawrence Taylor, Pepper Johnson, and Carl Banks will dominate a game. Combined with the crafty wisdom of Phil Simms and good look ing running of rookie Rodney Hampton, the Giants oflcnse can com pete with any team. Strong offensive line play will result in a Giants division crown. On the heals of the Giants will be the Washington Red skins. QB Mark Rypien could blossom into one of the leagues best with the help of wide-outs Gary Clark, Art Monk, and Ricky Sanders. The defense, behind veterans Wilbur Marshall and Charles Mann, appears strong enough to stop anyone. Look for a strong showing come play-off time. The Philadelphia Eagles, though remaining competitive this sea son, will encounter some difficulties. A strong pass rush behind line man Reggie White cannot overcome problems in the secondary. Look for Randall Cunningham to be productive when flushed from the pocket, but contain Randall and you contain the offense. The Dallas Cowboys and Phoenix Cardinals will battle for basement rights. Dallas needs two more years and six more draft picks before a winning season is in sight, while the Cardinals best hope might be for another change of scenery. In the NFC Central the Green Bay Packers should pull out ahead. With a little Majik, the Packer offense will role. Add to this the NFC leading receiver in Sterling Sharpe, and the offense will have the punch needed to win. Linebacker Tim Harris anchors a good defense that can stop the run. If the defensive line can apply some pressure on opposing quarterbacks, look out for the Pack. The Minnesota Vikings, Chicago Bears, Detroit Lions, and Tampa Bay Buccaneers all pose a minor threat to Green Bay. The Vikings have become the team with all the potential but no production. Run Hcrschcl Walker from the I-formation and the Vikings might surprise people. The Bears arc in need of a quar terback. Jim Harbaugh won't cut it, but running backs Neal Anderson and rookie Johnny Bailey might help. In addition, Dan Hampton's ten knee operations can no longer anchor the defense. Barry Sanders and the run and shoot could make things interesting in Motown, but they are still lacking the defensive talent to talk of post-season possibilities. It is a crucial year for Vinny Tcstaverdc to prove he can play in the NFL. Another year of experience for Testavcrdc and the addition of rookie Keith McCants make the Bucs an improved team, but not quite playoff material. Most fans attention will be focused on the NFC West this season as the San Francisco 49crs attempt for their third consecutive Super Bowl championship. How can one pick against them? Not only do they field one of the most talented teams in the league, but their discipline and sense of team play is unparalleled. The leadership of Joe Montana will give the Niners the division title once again. Early season injuries will keep the Los Angeles Rams from winning the division this year, but they are an assured wild card team and will be extremely tough in the playoffs. The Ram offensive line should give quarterback Jim Ever ett the time he needs to connect with deep threats Flipper Anderson and Henry Ellard. No clear sense of leadership will haunt the New Orleans Saints this season. How long will the unproven John Fourcade lead the offense? A  quarterback controversy will develop between Bobby Hebert and Fourcade if the Saints do not win early. The biggest prob lem facing Jerry Glanvillc and his Atlanta Falcons is their presence in the NFC West. A  definitely improved team, but still a cellar dweller. This brings us to Super Bowl X X V . Here arc our individual predictions: Eric sees the Rams over the Chiefs. Mark thinks the Giants over the Raiders. Beg to differ?

Athlete of the Week,"# Senior wide receiver Lester Erb receives Athlete of the Week honors after scoring three touchdowns in a 42-29 loss to Hofstra last Saturday. Erb reached the end zone on his first two pass receptions-- a 13- yardcr and a 44-yardcr. He then opened up the second half with an explosive 75-yard kickoff return for his eleventh career touchdown with the Bison. A three-time lcttcrman for Buck nell, Erb has caught 63 passes for 1162 yards during his distin guished career with the Bison."

Cross-country to face,
Connecticut tomorrow,"By Jennifer Walsh The Bucknell men's cross country team placed first in the Sep tember 8 Lafayette Invitational Tourney, a five-mile race in which Bucknell accumulated 40 points and defeated LaSalle by two points. Thomas Wuchcnich '92, Judd Jardcn '93, David Howard '93, Tom Eaglcson '93, and Todd Vincent '92 were the five top finishers for the Bison. Wuchcnich placed fourth, just 30 seconds behind LaSalle's Schwind, who won the meet in 26:18. Buckncll's Jardcn, Howard, Eaglcson, and Vincent came in sev enth, eighth, tenth, and eleventh, respectively. LaSalle finished a close sec ond in this preliminary meet, tally ing 42 points as the Explorers placed two of the top three runners. However, some of Buckncll's lead ing runners did not compete in this preliminary race. Next week should provide a clear perspective on the season's outlook, as the men's team will compete in their first official meet of the season, against Rutgers, Manhattan, and Connecticut. In running against a team as strong as Connecticut, Bucknell will face a tough test to increase its 167 dual-match consecutive win ning streak which dates back to 1974. The Bison's 16-year stretch is one of the most impressive in the history of N C A A  athletics. The runners, however, don't anticipate to feel much pressure due to "" the streak."" Norbert Bcrenyi '91 asserted, ""W e'd like to keep the streak going, but that won't be foremost on our minds. Everyone will just be looking to run as well as they possibly can."" As far as strategy is con cerned, Bcrenyi said that the Bison would ""pretty much just be keying in on U-Conn in general-- not indi vidual runners."" Tomorrow's meet will also mark the first race for the woman's cross-country team this season. The women will compete against teams from Connecticut, Rutgers, and George Mason."
Tennis defeats UMBC,"By Chris Mosunic The yellow ball bounced in Buckncll's favor during the women's tennis match last Sunday, at the University of Maryland Balti more County. UM BC was hounded by Buckncll's strong offense and winning attitude. The Lady Bison crushed the opposition in 18 straight sets cn route to a 9-0 victory. In second- singles, Kymm Carlson '94 cruised to a 6-1, 6-0 win. Kim Thompson '93 also breezed through her fourth-singles match 6-1, 6-0. Thompson and Carlson then teamed up to capture the first- doubles match, once again by the score of 6-1,6-0. To many o f the players this seemed to be a preliminary warm up to their big match against Army tomorrow. As Elizabeth Murphy commented, ""The match was a big confidence booster for us. Army will be tougher but we don't know exactly what to expect - this being their first year with women's tennis as a varsity sport."" Coach Rose Ewan is working the team harder than ever in antici pation of the upcoming battle with Army."

Men's soccer jumps to 3-0,"By Chad Brown With 24 years of experience, Buckncll men's soccer coach Craig Reynolds has learned to be prudent when making predictions on an upcoming season. One lucky Colin Bridgewater/The Bucknellian Tri-captain Kirk Lorie '91 unleashes a long throw-in last week against Susquehanna. Lorie is oneof the four starting Bucknell defenders who have helped shut down the opposition. bounce here or there can often make the difference between vic tory and defeat. Coach Reynolds' 1990 team is taking this season one game at a time, in hopes that the ball will bounce in their favor. The Bison seemingly have a nice mix of youth and experience to start out this season. The team is led by senior tri- captains Terry Pclino, Brandon Poe, and Kirk Lorie. Lorie and Poe should provide defensive stability to an otherwise young and inexperi enced backficld. ""I am concerned about our defense,"" says Reynolds. ""We need to eliminate errors and minimize mental mistakes."" Yet, through three games to date, the defense seems to be hold ing up well, achieving shutouts over Dickinson College (1-0), Sus quehanna University (8-0), and Temple University (1-0). Temple provided the most trying contest, warranting Reynolds to describe the game as ""winning the hard way."" One strength the Bison seem to be developing is their depth in goal. Returning for Buckncll is Scott Racck '91, who had five shut outs for the team last year. Mark Wriglcy '94 is also having an out standing fall while seeing plenty of action in the net. Reynolds is giv ing them equal lime, and will let the test of time dictate who will remain as the keeper for the dura tion of the season. Pclino is the leader of a solid midfield corps that has many returning contributors. Reynolds is optimistic about his midfielders, and thinks they will be successful if they ""arc consistent and keep the game quick and simple."" The offense is fronted by last year's scoring leader, Ken Gulick '91. Gulick has already earned Patriot League Player of the Week honors this season for his hat trick against Susquehanna. Backing him is Chad Heilman '92 who had a score in the Susquehanna game, as well as the lone goal in the Dickin son contest. Reynolds is concerned that ""sometimes we hold the ball too long and fail to take advantage of the opportunities created by the opponents' mistakes."" ""As a team I feel that we are mentally tough and can hold off the pressure of a tight one gaol game,"" assesses Reynolds. ""We need to keep fighting and play con sistently at a level better than our opponents. I feel we can beat any team on our schedule, but also, we could lose to any team on the schedule."" Buckncll will be tested early in the fall campaign as they travel for road games tomorrow at Lehigh and Tuesday versus Drexcl. ""These next six games arc crucial for us,"" insists Reynolds. ""We need to get off to a good start."" So far, with a 3-0 record and three shutouts under their belts, it appears that the Bison arc well on their way. Colin Bridgewater/The Bucknellian Bucknell's defense, shown here converging on a Susquehanna attacker, has performed admirably thus far this season. In the Bison's initial three wins, they have yet to be scored upon."
Intensity level high as,
water polo starts season,"By Scott Pollins Staff Writer After hosting the Annual Bucknell Open last weekend, the Bison water polo team is redefining the word ""intense."" Coached by Lynn Kachmarik, the polo players have been vigorously training for the past several weeks, practicing between 6-8 a.m. three days a week in addition to regular afternoon workouts. Led by captain John Ziegler '91 and graduate student Tim Smal- done, the Bison also feature last year's top scorers Kevin Shroth '92, Walter Kelly '92, and Danny Brown '93. John Bradbury '92 returns at goal. Kachmarik is also counting on veterans Mead Briggs 91, AJ. Zottola '92, Dan Killinger '92 and Chris Retzlcr '93 to pro vide veteran leadership. The remainder of the squad showcases promising freshmen and newcomers. The Bison registered strong performances against the New York Athletic Club A and B teams, which are primarily composed of Buckncll alumni. Later the Bison played its most challenging game against arch-rival and perennial powerhouse Slippery Rock. The standing-room-only crowd pro vided Buckncll with tremendous support, and despite losing 7-5, the Bison were optimistic about their chances in this weekend's Eastern League Tournament, held at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis. Kachmarik said that ""the guys were really up for the game and turned in a fine performance."" As the top 16 teams of the East will participate in the upcom ing tournament, eighth-seeded Buckncll looks to make a statement against strong competition. The Bison open against a lough Army squad, and depending on the out come of the game, Buckncll may face other Mid-Atlantic rivals, such as Iona and Navy. Kachmarik has been pleased with her team's progress and deter mination thus far this season, stressing that ""their attitude and work desire arc incredible. This is the hardest working group I have ever worked with at Buckncll."" It appears this young polo team has the intensity and dedica tion for completing a successful season.

BSG votes to ban chalk writing,
on University-owned property,
Congress to reconsider resolution on Sunday,"President of the service fra- By Michael McGandy Staff Writer In a vote that may spark a campus-wide debate on the issue of first amendment rights, the Buck nell Student Government last Sun day approved a motion to recom mend that the University ban all writing on its sidewalks. The motion, passed by a vote of four teen to ten with three abstentions, will be reconsidered this Sunday. The motion to reconsider will be the first item on the BSG's agenda. The author of the motion, Keith Eisenstein '92, a class repre sentative to the BSG, stated that he put forward the motion in order to respond to what he perceived to be a strong sentiment amongst the stu dent body against chalking on the sidewalk. Class Representative Brian Selmeski '92, who led the opposi tion to the motion, stated that this step encroaches dangerously on first-amendment rights. ""There should be no restriction on intellec- tual thought and expression at a lib eral aits university,"" Selmeski said in support of his position. This form of writing, known as ""chalk-talk,"" became a more common method of communication last semester among some organi zations, both recognized and clan destine at Bucknell. According to Eisenstein, this chalking of the sidewalk is a form of graffiti which should be prohibited. ""The motion is designed to protect the physical appearance of the campus. We have one of the nicest campuses in the Northeast and the appearance of chalk is dis ruptive,"" Eisenstein said in expli cating his motion. Eisenstein did say, though, that his motion was not intended to ""protect the political appearance of the campus."" Much of the chalking that has been done has been overtly political and representative of posi tions which are directly in conflict. The most prominent has been the chalking of a feminist organization called Partnership of Women Engaged in Revolution (P.O.W.E.R.) and clandestine responses to their political messages. When reached for comment P.O.W.E.R. and another organiza tion that engages in chalk-talk, Friends of Lesbians and Gay Men, both expressed their opposition to the BSG's resolution on the grounds that it limited dialogue within a university environment that should encourage communication."
A,"representative from P.O.W.E.R. stated that their organi zation's ""actions are on the whole benign, yet it is apparent that the BSG's primary attack is against us, since we are the ones who chalk the walkways most frequently."" According to Eisenstein, it was not the political content of the chalking that provoked his opposi tion, but the form of expression itself. Eisenstein said he opposes such chalk-talk whether its is done by P.O.W.E.R., or by the service fraternity Alpha Phi Omega. temity Alpha Phi Omega Michelle Romeo expressed concern that a ban on chalking the sidewalk would limit of her organization's ability to advertise for events such as the Red Cross blood drive. Alpha Phi Omega, which was the first organization on campus to use chalk-talk, has found the chalking of the sidewalk to be an effective method to attract people to their philanthropic activities. Further, Eisenstein said, ""I do not think that first amendment rights are being violated. We are not telling anyone not to express their opinions."" He cited that there were many other forms and medi ums through which students can communicate without chalking on the University's sidewalks. Selmeski, however, argued that ""if this motion were to become policy it is going to discriminate against everyone, but mostly against groups that have few other means of communicating, such as P.O.W.E.R.

new Science Complex is well underway,"By Bob Ritter Staff Writer The Bucknell Student Gov ernment, in cooperation with an off-campus marketing firm, will soon be distributing a Lewisburg Discount Card to all members of the Bucknell community. The card, given free of charge to students, faculty, staff and their families, will entitle the bearer to various dis counts at local businesses which have purchased space on the card. Bucknell Student Government's distribution of the card brings renewed attention to the Univer sity's controversial sales and solici tation policy, since two Bucknell students were denied University permission to market a similar card on campus last spring. Dave Skena '92, BSG presi dent, explained that V.I.P. Services, a marketing firm, contacted the businesses involved. The busi nesses pay a fee determined by the size and location of their advertise ment on the card. Five percent of all money collected from the busi nesses then goes to BSG, which By Travis Elliott Staff Writer With the kick off of this year's senior gift drive, some sen iors have expressed their discontent with the university and their intent not to contribute to the senior gift drive. The goal for the senior class of 1991 is to raise $115,000 and to improve on the record of 77% sen ior participation. Seniors are being asked to pledge $100 per year for the next five years. Maggy Rislow, assistant director of annual giving, said, 'The percentage participation of the senior class is the most impor tant aspect of the senior gift drive. A number of corporations request alumni participation percentages from Universities; they don't want to donate to a University which is not supported by its own alumni."" Since 1987, the participation percentages of seniors have fallen from a high of 77% to only 64% in 1990; however, the total monetary contributions from the classes have been steadily rising from $85,253 in 1987 to $136,910 in 1990. Rislow explained that Bucknell has a well-developed sen- distributes the card on campus. Skena said that the final amount BSG will receive has not yet been determined, pending a final accounting by V.I.P. Services. Skena also said ""We don't know what we're going to use [the funds] for yet."" He went on to explain that the primary purpose of the card is not to generate additional BSG funds, but to ""provide a concrete, tangible service to the University community."" Both Skena and John Dunlop, dean of students, explained that the card does not violate the sales and solicitation policy, since the pro ceeds benefit BSG, and are not for a student's personal profit. The current University sales and solicitation policy states that, ""Except with written approval, sales and solicitations on campus or in residential units are prohibited. Approval for sales and solicitations must be obtained from the dean of students."" Before the current policy was adopted in 1985 student sales and solicitations were permitted as ior gift drive compared to other uni versities. She also noted that other universities have requested infor mation on Bucknell's senior gift drive so that they can emulate the success of the program. One disgruntled senior, Michael Klemen '91 contended that tuition should cover the costs of education, but he also said, ""As a student, I see what the University could really use. Money does not seem to be the correct band-aid. The way that the senior gift drive is organized, I don't know where my money is going or how it's being spent."" Klemen also said that he might feel more obligated to donate if the university had a list of their specific needs, and he could choose to donate to a specific projects which he would deem worthy. Chris Daniels '91, chairman of the senior gift drive, recanted that stu dents do have the option of ear marking their donation to one of four existing funds. The Annual Fund is the main, all encompassing fund which includes all academic departments at Bucknell as well as financial aid. In addition seniors can send their"
Second phase of,"By Tara G. Gilligan Scenes of construction next to the year-old chemistry building have hardly gone unnoticed by stu dents in the first few weeks of school. The construction site is the location for the new $12 million biology building set for completion by the fall semester of next year. The building, which will actually be attached to the existing chemistry building, is part of a three stage project to update the facilities of the science depart ments. Updated laboratories and research facilities to be used by faculty and students and will be located in this building. ""In a nutshell, the existing quality of our biology facilities has for years not kept pace with the quality of faculty, the quality of the students, and the quality of the pro gram. It was necessary to upgrade the facility,"" said Barry Maxwell, contributions to the Bison Club, the Association for the Arts, or the Engineering Fund. The Bison Club is an athletic fund which com pletely subsidizes student use of Bucknell's gym facilities as well as providing specific teams with addi tional monies. The Association for the Arts goes to subsidize those events which come to the Weis Center, and finally, the Engineering Fund pays for some of the expen sive equipment and higher salaries which are characteristic of the engi neering department. Rislow also said, ""Very few people really realize that alumni subsidize every student that attends Bucknell. Even without financial aid, students only pay about 70% of the actual costs of attending the University, due to the generosity of alumni."" The senior gift drive is set up as a pyramidal management struc ture, with 15 seniors on the steering committee acting as coordinators. Each steering committee member coordinates the activities of his or her subordinate captains, and each captain in return manages five cam- See DRIVE, page 5 vice president for administration. Maxwell serves as head of the Sci ence Facilities Planning Commit tee, responsible for coordinating the project. Jack Harclerode, biology pro fessor and member of the commit tee, said he hopes the building will be finished by next fall. ""We would like it to be done by the last day of August next year, but with the delays we've had, that may be stretching it,"" he said. Delays came in several forms, according to Maxwell. ""Material delays can often be a problem and weather delays can be a real problem and totally out of our control,"" Maxwell said. According to Harold Rearick, construction worker, progress ""could be faster."" He sited the removal of asbestos from Olin Sci ence to be the cause of a two week building delay. ""We had to shut down for a few weeks while they took out the asbestos,"" he said. But according to Maxwell, this delay had been accounted for. As part of phase II, which includes the building of the biology build ing, the Olin science building underwent renovations. As far as weather goes, Rear ick said that if the roof is not up before the first snow, delays could result. ""I have my doubts as to whether we'll be on the roof by then,"" he said. The project, now at Phase II in the three-phase plan, will eventu ally include the building of a psy chology facility. All stages are being funded separately. Phase II will cost approximately $12 million dollars, much of which Maxwell hopes will come from donations. In addition, the university will be ""drawing on reserve funds on the assumption that campaign pledges will replace those reserve funds that we're using to fund the project."" ""We took what's called a $7 million bridge loan this past June for a seven year period. That will fund part of the $12 million pro ject,"" he said. The new facility will accom modate an expanding field and advanced research, according to Harclerode. The basement of the biology building ""will contain things like the animal facilities,"" he said. On that floor will be areas for holding animals in temperature--regulated rooms, for washing cages, and for performing surgical operations on the animals. Also in the basement will b a microscopy are where stu dents will be able to use an electron microscope to view tissues. The first floor will house three classrooms and two labs, intended for non--major biology courses, which Harclerode referred to as ""baby bio."" In addition, sev eral laboratories will be set aside for freshman and sophomore biol ogy majors. Six faculty members will have offices and laboratory space on the second floor, ""these labs will be equipped for things like cellular and molecular kinds of biology,"" explained Harclerode. Each of the six faculty mem bers has his own laboratory in order to facilitate research with students. ""We do a lot of undergraduate research where we take the student in and for class credit [he] can do research with the professor."" An added feature, the bio. chemistry majors will have classes on the second floor, at the part of the building where the biology and chemistry structures are adjacent. Bio. chemistry is a major which the university implemented only last year. The professors and students who deal more with whole organ isms will use laboratories located on the third floor. ""There will be a herbarium where we'll put our See BUILDING, page 5 David Fass/The Bucknellian The $12 million biology building, phase II of the new Science Complex has been under construction since last Spring."

Card,"From page 1 The Bucknellian September 21, 1990 long as the businesses ""[did] not interfere with the aims or purposes of Bucknell University."" Some students, however, question the appropriateness of the sales and solicitation policy, which prevents individual student enter prise while seeming to tolerate exceptions to that policy, such as the Bucknell Student News Ser vice. Charlotte Jacobsen Weddle, associate vice president for student life, explained that the News Ser vice is allowed because ""It has been in existence a long time, pro vides a service to students, [and] is not purely for personal gain."" She said the present policy was enacted ""to be a mechanism for making sure students are not inundated"" by student entrepren eurs. Dunlop said that another main reason for the policy's adoption was ""our sensitivity to criticism from local merchants, [who] had increasing concerns about competi tion from business activities on campus. According to Dunlop, the University receives ten percent of the net receipts of the News Ser vice, which is allowed to use the Bucknell name. Skena responded to such exceptions by saying, ""I didn't make the sales and solicitation pol icy, and I can't say I agree with every aspect of it, but BSG found a way to provide a service to the Bucknell community while work ing within the present structure, whether it is followed or n o t"" Bill Farrell '92, an outspoken critic of the current University pol icy, accuses the administration of censoring needs."" He claims ""Buckneil's definition of service is questionable,"" since any successful business must provide a service needed by its customers, who value the service enough to pay for it. Farrell also pointed to the adver tisements for magazines, credit cards and other products in the classrooms of the academic build ings as another example of a double standard in the University's ""philo sophical problem with students making a profit."" Last semester, Farrell submit ted a proposal to the Committee on Complimentary Activities (CCA) which would allow individual entrepreneurship, while such activ ity would be approved and regu lated by a student/faculty commit tee, and both sales and advertising would be limited; CCA examined and rejected the proposal. Farrell feels the policy should be broad ened to allow ""a regulated student entrepreneurial program in which young entrepreneurs would be given the chance to see their ideas and talents put to work."" Farrell feels the BSG Dis count Card ""is positive for the Bucknell community, [since] it lays the groundwork for what is to come."" He is optimistic that stu- dents may be able to take over the production of the BSG card next year. Farrell's optimism raises the question: if an outside vendor is allowed to conduct business on the Bucknell campus and retain 95 per cent of the profits from the venture, can a student operate in precisely the same way? Dunlop said ""the policy might permit"" such an arrangement, but that such a ven ture had never been proposed by a student. Dunlop said that outside ven dors are currently allowed ""in prac tice but not in policy."" He feels the University should ""develop criteria for approval of outside vendors or student entrepreneurs,"" and that student businesses should be allowed ""but we would have to do it exactly the same as for outside vendors."" Dunlop concluded that ""since we allow [outside vendors], we need to put it down in writing,"" and that he will posssibly propose that CCA consider the matter."

"Hammerlee, Maraldo named",
to campus clergy positions,"By Susan Elolampi Bucknell welcomes two new comers to its religious program. Mr. Jim Hammerlee has an intcrum two year appointment as university chaplain. But, as he explains, he is ""old to Bucknell, but new to this assignment."" Mr. Hammerlee first came to Bucknell in 1966 to be the executive secre tary of what was then Buckncll's largest organiza tion, the Bucknell University Chris tian Association. The BUCA was essentially a student union, comparable to the Office of Student Activities at Bucknell today. Essentially, there were about 200 students, forming two components of the BUCA. There was an out of class educational program consist ing of international programs and exchanges as well as a number of Bucknell residential colloquies. These were very popular in the late Photo by Ashley Chertkof Jim Hammerlee, was recently appointed University Chaplain. sixties and early seventies, with speakers, such as b.f. maiz, who stayed in the residences and took part in Bucknell life. The other part of the BUCA was volunteer ser vices. The BUCA, which changed its name to Concern and Action in 1968, continued until the early eighties. Mr. Ham- mcrlcc feels it may be time for another BUCA. ""My Bucknell experience has been so much with students that it reminds me of the BUCA."" Mr. Ham- mcrlcc did his theological work at Yale Univer sity Divinity School and is an ordained minister in the United Methodist Church. ""My goal,"" he explains, ""with my two year assignment, is to help an ever increasing number of students feel that this place (Rooke Chapel) is part of their life on campus. It was built to comple ment the rest of the academic pro gram and to give the students the opportunities to develop their views of life."" Also new to Bucknell, Father Angelo Maraldo, O.S.F.S. (Oblate of St. Francis de Sales--a relig ious community) assumes the role of Catholic cam pus minister. Prior to coming to Bucknell, Father Angelo taught religion at the high school level and worked in the Father Angelo Maraldo, the newly areas of retreat appointed Cathloic campus ministry and minister counseling. He is a graduate of Moravian College in Bethlehem, Pennsylva nia with a Bachelor's degree in music education. He has also received a Master's degree in divin ity from the Pastoral Ministry and a Master of Arts degree in liturgy from the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C. Father Angelo believes that college students often wonder how faith fits into their lives and wants ""to encour age young adults and affirm their goodness."" He hopes to share his vision of church with those of stu dents, faculty, staff, and admin istration. By doing this, he feels people may Photo by Ashley Chertkof learn to live gos pel values in today's world. Father Angelo empha sizes Bucknell's interfaith pro gram and hopes ""they (all faiths) can work together to bring about unity."" Building on this, both Father Angelo and Mr. Hammerlee hope to form some sort of student coun cil or very inclusive organization in the chapel for people of all faiths. As Mr. Hammerlee sums up their sentiments, 'This assign ment is a very gratifying one."""
MacJanet replaced,
by AppleShare,"By Michael Curtis Staff Writer A new network to replace Waterloo MacJanet has been installed on campus. Waterloo Macjanct had ""outlived its useful ness here"" according to Sue Shields, Bucknell Computer Ser vices Staff member. The new network, a product of Apple Computer Corporation is called AppleShare. Here at Buck- ncll, AppleShare is implemented using four centeralizcd computers as servers. They are located in the computer center. All the software for the whole campus is located on these computers. Shields stated that the new network will have problems, and will be slower, but more reliable than the aging MacJanet. Apple- Share makes it possible to per form software installation and maintcnce much more efficiently than previously possible. Students have already noticed this slowness. Keith Over- ton 93, BCS Student Assistant stated that ""It seems to take a lot longer. People are starting to com plain."" The general student reac tion to the new network was summed up with Julia Stout '93 wondering, ""Why did they have to change it?"" She said it was a has sle at first, but she has found it easy to use. Another change made by BCS this year is introduction of a policy allowing only one copy of a document to be printed on a printer. This is implemented in the software, and many students have found it to be annoying. Later in the semester as part of the changes, all IBM computers will be on a campus-wide net work, also. The new IBM lab in the Chemistry Building will be the first to have the new connections, and, like the Macintoshes, the IBMs will also require startup disks in the future. (T"
Coin prices on copiers double,"By Michael McGandy Staff Writer In an effort to encourage the use of copier debit cards, the Ellen Clarke Bertrand Library has raised the cost of making copies with coins. The cards, which are described by library personnel as more convenient, will allow stu dents to continue to make copies at a cost of five cents each, while those without debit cards will have their copying costs doubled to ten cents per page. This change in price, which only effects copiers in the library, is an effort to promote the use of the debit cards, as well as to discou rage people not associated with Bucknell from using the library's copying facilities. ""The whole objective is to make it easier for students to make copies. We would also like to dis courage non-Bucknell people from making use of the machines,"" said Joanne Young, associate director of the library. A random sampling of stu dents using the copier machines found that most had a debit card and considered it to be more con venient than using coins. Mamie Bartholomew '94 said she used the card ""because it is cheaper and I do not feel like carrying change around."" As far as the extra cost of using coins is concerned, she stated, ""It does not really bother me. I see it as an incentive to use the card."" Amy Rogers '91, while con sidering the card to be a good idea, found it ""kind of annoying that you have to pay an extra five cents to use coins. They should not punish you if you do not use the card."" Responding to questions as to whether the library was punishing people for using coins, Young said, ""If you want to think of it as a pen alty, it is a penalty. We like to think of it as an incentive."" ""We are trying to make all the information the students and faculty need available as quickly as possible,"" said Young. 'The pur pose of the library is to encourage freedom of information."" Raising the cost of copies made with coins is also intended to discourage non-Buckncll people, who are unlikely to have a debit card, from using the library's copi ers. According to Young, the library has received numerous com plaints from students who have been kept waiting to use a copier by people from off-campus. The library presently has seven public copiers and one copier reserved for faculty use. According to Jim Muchlcr, director of administrative services, the copiers in the library arc ""an extension of their information ser vices"" and library-related uses should have priority over others. In this respect public use is a problem, Muchlcr said, since many people use the library's facilities for their personal copying needs. Further, Muchlcr said that the cost of copier paper has risen dra matically over the last four months, increasing twenty-five percent to $5.30 per a thousand sheets. In the face of these increases the Univer sity is ""practically the only public copier in town charging a nickel."" As a result, Muchlcr stated, many people from town arc using the Library as a copying center. Muchler said that the Univer sity docs not view its copiers as a source of profit and attempts to operate them as close to cost as possible. The library, according to Young, operates on the same pol icy. The added cost for not using the debit card is not expected to bring in much extra revenue. ""In fact,"" said Young, ""if the cards are used, as we hope they will be, there will not be any extra funds."" Young also stated that the increase in cost for those using coins, was not being used as a means to create revenue to cover other expenses within the library. Despite the rising cost of paper at least one local copy center, Lewisburg Office Equipment, is still charging five cents per per sonal copy. Angie Sheets, an employee at thp store, said that they also make copies at three and four cents for professors and non-profit organiza tions. ""We already have quite a number of students and professors who have us make copies for them,"" Sheets said. While the transition to the debit card is raising the cost of cop ying in the library, it may actually keep the cost of copying down in the future. Faced with the increas ing cost of paper, Muchler said, ""The reality is that we will have to raise the cost of copies in the future."" The benefit of the card is that costs can be raised in incre ments, rather than jumping from five to ten cents. Muchler said, though, that he did not see the cost of copying rising in the short term. According to Muchlcr, the debit card appears to be the way of the future for accessing services on the Bucknell campus. It is his goal to put the present magnetic stripe of the debit card on the student ID, as well as expand the function of that second magnetic stripe. ""We arc closer and closer all the time to integrating the vendor stripe onto the student ID,"" Much ler said. The vending company appears to have an integrated card that works, but it is yet to be tested by Bucknell. The functions of the second magnetic stripe could also be expanded to include access to vend ing machines and washing machines. According to Eric Schmidt, the University's purchas ing agent, these magnetic stripes have the potential for a whole range of vending services. Currently a contract with Pepsi Cola Co. using the debit system on a trial basis is being considered, but the status of the University's examination of this possibility is uncertain. Schmidt did state that there would be difficulties integrating all of these vendor services onto a ID card which will still need to per form the functions it docs now: pro viding borrowing privileges at the library, meal plan and declining balance accounts, and the ability to charge merchandise at the book store. Considering these logistical problems, according to Schmidt, students cannot expect such a mul tipurpose card until some time in the future."

Cartel using US,
weapons,"Government officials in Columbia announced that dozens of weapons given to the Nicara guan contras by the United States are ending up in the hands of Colombian drug cartels. Officials fear that the flow of arms could increase. American authorities have acknowledged in the past that about 80 percent of the drug traf fickers' weapons come from the United States. Colombian govern ment officials are worried and angered by the shipment of contra weapons, which they blame indi rectly on the United States. At the same time, intelli gence units in Colombia and the United States are investigating reports that a boatload of sophisti cated weapons, sent from Italy, arrived in Venezuela and was shipped to Colombia in early Sep tember. The arms may signal a new link between the drug cartels and organized crime in Italy and Spain to provide and distribute cocaine in Europe."

In addressing the federal par liament, Gorbachev stated that the decollectivization of land was too important to leave to a small group of politicians. Allowing referendums is a novel political concept within the Soviet Union. Soviet officials pre dicted that it would take at least six months to organize a viable refe rendum on land ownership."

Mandela's bodyguards are accused kidnapping the victims and taking them to the Mandela home, where Mandela and the guards allegedly beat them. One of the victims was taken away by a bodyguard. Five days later the boy's body was found in a field with stab wounds to his throat. The youths were suspected of being police informants. The decision to prosecute Mandela could complicate negotia tions between the government and the ANC concerning fundamental changes in the nation's political structure."

Barbara Tieman, Stanford's health and safety-systems coordi nator, said the containers are to serve the University's 8,500 stu dents who may be left homeless after an earthquake. The university sustained $140 million in damage from the earthquake in San Francisco last October."

Windows were broken and property was marred by graffiti at the houses, which have large Jew ish memberships. In another inci dent, the tires on a student's car were slashed and anti-Semitic mes sages were scratched on the doors. Stephanie Peterson, spokes woman for the Madison police department, said that since July about 18 incidents of vandalism against the Jewish community have been investigated."

The Community said that they would consider extending enforcement of the United Nations embargo against Iraq to include air traffic. Officials stated that the United Nations Security Council must back an expanded boycott so that it is effective on a global basis. EC action was criticized by American officials as muddled and meek. But last week's raids on the French, Dutch, and Belgian diplo matic compounds have resulted in more forceful actions."
Iraqis bolster,
forces in Kuwait,"The Iraqi government has sharply increased the numbers of tanks and troops in Kuwait and southern Iraq, the Defense Depart ment announced Tuesday. The buildup appears to be defensive in nature and would make it more difficult to push Iraqi forces from Kuwait militarily. Iraq moved 95,000 more troops into Kuwait and southern Iraq within the past two weeks, bringing the total to about 360,000. Military analysts say that up to 40 percent of the troops belong to pre mier military units. Two abortion rights leaders told the Senate Judiciary Commit tee Tuesday that Supreme Court nominee David Souter should not be confirmed to the court. In response, several senators told them that Souter was the least hos tile nominee that they could expect from the Bush Administration. Kate Michelman, executive director of the National Abortion Rights Action League, and Faye Wattleson, president of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, remained uneasy. Michelman testified that ""we remain intensely concerned that, if confirmed, he would destroy 17 years of precedent and cast the deciding vote to overrule Roe v. Wade,"" the 1973 ruling establishing a constitutional right to an abortion. Souter ended his testimony before the senate committee Mon day, virtually assured of confirmation."

According to the indictment, Keating and his associates violated California security laws by misleading inves tors into believing that the bonds were covered by federal deposit insurance. Keating owned Lincoln from 1984 to 1989, when it was seized by the government and declared insolvent. The cost of the Lincoln bailout will be more that $2 billion, the costliest savings and loan col lapse to date."

Chalk--,"From page 1 and the method by which its communicated."" If the resolution withstands Selmeski's motion to reconsider on Sunday, it will move onto the administration for consideration. Eisenstein expressed confidence that the resolution would be accepted by the administration and stated that he had been given assu rances from an administrator in the spring that they were in favor of ceasing chalk-talk. When reached for comment, President Gary Sojka said that he was ""stunned"" by the BSG's reso lution and did not feel able to reply immediately. ""This is a very seri ous issue and I am not ready to comment,"" Sojka stated, ""this is the sort of thing that bedevils Superior Court Justices."" John Dunlop, dean of student life, stated that he believed that chalk-talk ""in and of itself is not wrong and is not open to prohibi tion. This sort of expression is pro tected by the first amendment"" So long as chalking stayed away from forms of speech that would be con sidered name calling or tasteless and it was not used on buildings, Dunlop said, any writing which elicits thinking is positive. ""People who want to limit speech are whis tling Dixie,"" Dunlop said, ""they are just out to lunch."" Eisenstein said that he was motivated to present his motion by what he considered to be a wide spread opinion on the campus that chalk-talk is an objectionable form of speech. Faced with the possibil ity that last Sunday's resolution will be reversed by a congress that will contain ten new freshman rep resentatives, Eisenstein stated that he was prepared to offer a motion for a student referendum. (It is uncertain at this moment if the freshman representa tives will be able to vote on Sun day. David Skena '91, president of the BSG, stated that he was unclear as to what parliamentary procedure"
The BSG Resolution,"Whereas: Many feel that chalk writing on university property defaces and detracts from this beautiful campus, and Whereas: There arc many less disruptive and cleaner meth ods to publicize messages and opinions, Therefore Be it Resolved: that BSG recommend that chalk talk be banned to all students and student organizations."

Today, Skena and Dunlop were scheduled to meet to clarify this issue.) A student referendum on chalking, Eisenstein believes, is likely to be in favor of the aboli tion of chalk-talk. ""Right now I am going off my understanding of the student body and I believe that they are dissatisfied with this mode of communication."" If such a referendum were held there is the possibility that students may not respond to chalk- talk itself, but the most common example of it usage, the messages written by the feminist organiza tion P.O.W.E.R. Since last spring P.O.W.E.R. has been chalking the University's sidewalks with quotes from men and women which high light concerns over the present state of relations between the sexes. Their activities have been met with much dissatisfaction and disapproval from many members of the campus community. If a referendum were used by the BSG, Eisenstein stated that he ""would not be able to say exactly what the students were reacting to, but I would hope that they would not be voting against the content of the chalk-talk."" Selmeski said that he thought ""unfortunately that the BSG is in touch with the majority of students and their opinions,"" in that they wanted to ban the chalking of organizations such as P.O.W.E.R. According to Selmeski, though, majority rule must operate within the limits established by civil rights and constitutional law; he believes both protect the activity of chalk- talk. If the motion to reconsider fails Selmeski said that he would consider resigning his post on the BSG. 'The BSG has done a lot of things that I do not agree with, but this is the only act that I have seen that offends me,"" Selmeski said."

Poli-sci professor researches,
world problems in Bangladesh,"By Rob Schroeder What do you picture when someone mentions Bangladesh? Do you envision masses of people draped in exotic clothes, sur rounded by run-down buildings? Perhaps strange religious ceremo nies come to mind; the ones you've seen on PBS or in National Geo graphic. Or maybe you think of poverty, uncleanliness, and one of the lowest standards of living in the world. For a country so far away from Bucknell and from our lives, it's natural that we think of these images. Yet when someone men tions Bangladesh to Harry Blair, a professor of political science, he hears an important part of his life being mentioned. I recently spoke with Dr. Blair about his latest trip there, and about his deep interest in both Bangladesh and India. Dr. Blair was in Bangladesh for the ihonth of August, 1990, as a consultant to review a United States aid program This program, called the Private Rural Initiatives Project, was designed to help Ban gladeshi Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO's). These organizations are non-profit and designed to promote community uplift programs such as adult liter acy, building schools, and organiz ing youth groups. Also, since a large part of Bangladesh livelihood comes from farming, agriculture is one of the main focuses of the NGO. Dr. Blair explained that the organizations emphasize ""how-to"" farming techniques for crops like tomatoes, bamboo and fruit trees. Working with and building up the community was the essential point he stressed. The object of this particular project was to establish links between Bangladesh's numerous NGO's. Because of the large num ber of these organizations, Dr. Blair's group was responsible for helping to find the best methods of inter-NGO communication. When properly managed, these organiza tions can influence various social lobbying groups and present a strong case for some of Bangla desh's most pressing problems to its government. As team leader of the Private Rural Initiatives Project, Dr. Blair put his long association with Ban gladesh to work. He has visited the country over ten times, speaks its language, and has a long resume of degrees, projects, publications and field experience related to it. He has done several rural development projects in both Bangladesh and India and continues to study public policy both in south Asia and the United States. In addition to his scholarly research, he has worked for the US Agency for International Development, the World Bank, and the Swedish International Develop ment Authority, among other organizations. There is always the emphasis on community develop ment, always the humanitarian con cern in Dr. Blair's work. While interviewing Dr. Blair, I was impressed by his lengthy study of not only an area, but of problems that face the whole world. He has used his field experience to interpret universal concerns. Food problems plague our globe. Poverty is a never-ending problem for some nations. Development and public policy are constant concerns for all governments. So are economic con flicts and social justice. By the end of our talk I was convinced that alleviating these problems were Dr. Blair's professional and personal interests. I was assured of my hunch when he told me why he keeps going back to Bangladesh and India. It's the feeling that you can have some impact on problems, he said; that you can make a difference. The combination of these feelings and his draw to south Asia is what keeps taking Harry Blair back. Back to those countries that in reality look a lot like what we picture them to be poor, underde veloped nations in need of a hand. I'm sure that he will return to Ban gladesh as long as he feels he can do something not only for that country but for the advancement of humanitarian causes world-wide."
Surviving life without the Bison,"By Donna Walsh Here we are, having gone three weeks ""cold turkey"" without the old Bison, and we're still sur viving. The lack of this Bucknell institution has certainly affected us all (we may even be studying more?!?), but for the Bison, regu lars, it has been a very difficult time to endure. Much of the anxiety felt is self-inflicted, though. We were all curious to see the new Bison and Bison junkies especially looked for ward to spending long hours in the renovated snack bar. Many 1990 graduates even felt somewhat cheated that they would miss out on the proposed improvements. For many, this feeling of anticipation made the return to campus from the summer seem like a ""thrill of victory/agony of defeat"" commercial. With sweaty palms, pounding hearts, and smil ing faces Bucknellians approached the U.C. After months of waiting, we were finally going to see the new Bison! But, alas, the Bison was still boarded up! The sign read ""Snack Bar Located in the Cave"". The Cave? It had to be a cruel joke. If the anticipation felt a few minutes ago felt like the thrill of victory, then this must be the agony of defeat! After climbing to the second floor, a Bison junkie's worst fears were confirmed. There was a tiny sign with the words ""Snack Bar"" and an arrow pointing to the Cave, and inside was the tiny, brown- haired woman in the white uniform seated at the cash register. What have they done with our Bison? Julia Polyak '91 spoke for us all when she said, ""I'm glad the Bison is being renovated. Right now, though, I miss it, even though it's still in operation. It's just not the same as what we're used to."" A closer inspection showed that many of the ingredients that made up the old Bison are still present, but the old atmosphere is definitely lacking. Sure, the refrig erator is stocked with cartons of iced tea, there are tubs of Ben & Jerry's in the freezer, and the 3- cent double-bubble gum is still for sale. But cheese sticks are no longer on the menu, and neither are Bison breakfasts. In fact, the old chalk board menu is gone, too! The lunch crowd found other places to eat, and most importantly, no one seems to just relax and spend time there anymore. These losses are especially significant because the Bison was more than just a snack bar, it was therapy! Bucknellians could count on the Bison as a permanent study break, or a meal prepared just the way you liked it, or a place to drown your sorrows in junk food! ""It's the cave,"" remarked Tom Quinn '91. ""It's just not the same."" There is some good news, though. We are only a few, short weeks away from the renovated Bison that we were promised, and the new Bison promises to be even"
Ten tips:,"By Marc Hames Well, it's three weeks into school and according to Caf fre quenters, the food is getting just a little dull. To make matters worse, the preparation personnel is extremely understaffed with two workers gone, and two more soon to be leaving. However, it still might be possible to beat the odds, and get a livable meal with mini mum hassle. Caf worker and Buck nell student, Reenie Cummings GR, offered me the following advice for making mealtime more pleasant; 1. ""Don't come during rush hour (12:00, 5:00)."" (At these times the workers get kind of stressed out and are apt to verbally abuse a student innocently asking for an extra chicken burger. Diners better than it was before! Mary Byerly, manager of the Bison, vowed that the old favorites, including cheese sticks and Bison breakfasts, will still be featured on the menu when the new Bison opens. However, a variety of new foods such as freshly baked pizza, croissants, frozen yogurt, and ice cream sodas will also be offered. So, for all of you upperclassmen, just close your eyes and remember the way things used to be, and for all of you freshmen, you've got a great thing to look forward to! By Ashley Chertkof Hazel Brown checks students out at the register as they make pur chases in the temporary Bison. The new Bison is tentatively scheduled to open in late October or early November."
Making,"coming at an off-time are more likely to receive serving propor tions specially geared to their request) 2. ""Read the menu board located above the servers."" (This way it is possible to identify the food before actually putting it in your mouth.) 3. ""If you don't see some thing, ask."" (There are all sorts of goodies, especially ice cream, in those freezers behind the counter. So if all they have is ""Nutty Bud dies"" which you do not care for, just politely explain this fact to any of the workers who will be more than happy to drop everything and fish out a ""Chief Crunchee"" from the bottom of the freezer for you.) 4.

Let's Do Lunch,With Steve Hoerter and Julie Bachman Staff Writers
Little Italy,"50 North Derr Drive (Rt. 15), Lewisburg (717) 523-7806 Monday through Thursday 11 a.m. to Midnight Friday through Sunday 11 a.m. to 1 a.m. Little Italy, formerly Bertoni's Pizzeria, looked like it might be a good place to do lunch. We were sadly mistaken. Only after a bot tle of Turns and a few good chugs of Pepto were we able to sit down and write this scathing review of Italian food gone awry. The decorum in Little Italy has changed little from Bertoni's days...checkercd tablecloths, juke box, booths and a few square tables. We decided to sample several items on the menu: pepperoni pizza, fcttucini alfredo and lasagna. The fcttucini and lasagna dinners came with a house salad with choice of dressing and a bread basket. The pizza (medium S5.25) looked appetizing enough, but upon sampling it we found it to be bland and greasier than your average pizza. The tomato sauce lacked spunk -- tasting more like tomato puree. The crust was decent, but when is crust ever the deciding fac tor when it comes to choosing your favorite pizza.? Juhe tried the fcttucini alfredo ($5.50). It, unlike the pizza, looked unappetizing, with chips of pork scattered in the watery sauce. There was no real flavor and the pasta was not fresh. Julie does not recommend the fettucini alfredo for the more discriminating restauranteurs. Steve sampled the lasagna' ($5.00). Upon first inspection the cheese and sauce looked tantalizing -- but there was too much sauce and not enough meat or pasta to give the lasagna firmness. Steve thought that the lasagna offered in the caf was a bit more appetizing and tastier than that offered by Little Italy. Both dinners came with a shredded lettuce salad with slices of tomato, green olives, and a generous helping of your choice of dress ing. The salads and fresh bread were the highlights of the meal. Little Italy also offers a full range of hot and cold subs, soups, appetizers, calzone, stromboli, and other old Italian favorites. Prices are reasonable and delivery service is available free of charge. On a scale of 1 to 5 bison (1 being the LOWEST), we give Lit tle Italy a single bison. Editor's note: ""Let's Do Lunch"" and the yet to be published ""Wine, Dine and well...never mind"" with Julie and Steve will be reg ular weekly columns in this section of The BuckneIlian"

First A m e n d m e n t first,"With the passage of a resolution by Bucknell Student Government (BSG) last Sunday advocating the banning of ""chalk talk,"" the University community is once again grappling with the distinction between graffitti, vandalism and free speech. The concept of sidewalk chalking was first brought to the attention of our Community when Alpha Phi Omega received University permission last year to chalk sidewalks in order to promote their blood drive. The Partnership Of Women Engaged in Revolution (P.O.W.E.R.) followed Alpha Phi Omega's lead and began chalking the sidewalks to educate us about the oppression of women in society. Recognizing P.O.W.E.R.'s cause as legitimate, both Dean of Students John Dunlop and President Gary Sojka approved of P.O.W.E.R.'s activities as long as non-permanent writing materials were used, and obscenities were left out of their messages. Those supporting the BSG resolution say that all chalking should be banned, claiming that it is an eyesore to an otherwise aesthetically pleasing campus. What they overlook is every American citizen's fundamental right to freedom of speech. The current system provides for University"
(i.e.,"administrative), oversight of groups interested in using the campus' sidewalks as a forum for responsible communication. While we recognize that the sidewalks are University property, we would hope that the University would hold to Constitutional principles and allow all groups to write on sidewalks. Equal opportunity and access should be permitted -- without prior review or consultation, but sim ple notification. The BSG resolution passed last Sunday night was adopted without full representation of the student body. The Freshman class had no opportunity to voice its opinion on this very important matter. As the resolution comes up for reconsideration this Sunday night, we encourage the BSG to analyze this issue closely and realize the dramatic impact that this encroachment on first amendment rights would have on student's lives at Bucknell. The BSG will be setting a dangerous precedent by passing a resolution that restricts our freedom of speech. Clearly campus aesthetics should not be held in higher regard than the principles embodied in the Constitution of the United States."

"Ferraro criticizes news story,",
claims defamation of character,"Dear Editor I have read the article in the last Bucknellian concerning the Bucknell wrestling coach, written by Travis Elliott. I must seriously question the intent of the author. I would charge him with irresponsi ble journalism that borders on defa mation of character at the very least. The responsibility of the media is to report the news and not to create the news. I would strongly advise the Bucknellian staff to report the facts and not try to dam age anyone's character by creating a story. The story, as printed, is slanted, sensationalized, inaccurate, and very misleading. I will attempt to tell the story as it really happened. Bob FetTaro was a 50 per cent owner and an absentee partner in Decathlon Athletics, Inc. which is a private enterprise. Michele Connors was the office manager of Decathlon Athletics and not a part ner in the business. Jan Clemons was the clerk in the business who wrote a check to BTR, Inc. for the rent payment. There was enough money in the account at the time to cover the check. Michele Connors then wrote other checks to pay various invoices. However, she was not aware that Jan had written a check to BTR, Inc. The other checks were cashed before the BTR check. Therefore, the BTR check came back insufficient funds. A false police report was filed by Detective Dugan of the Milton Police Department He claimed that Bob Ferraro person ally wrote the check to BTR, Inc. knowing there was no money in the account to cover the check. Detec tive Dugan interviewed Jan Clem ons and was well aware that she wrote the check and at the time there was money in the account to cover the check. The charges were immedi ately dismissed by the Milton mag istrate. I am in the process of filing a law suit against Detective Dugan and the Milton Police Department for an obvious defamation of character. Decathl on Athletics went out of business in May of 1990. If the Bucknellian is interested in the personal life of Bob Ferraro they should know that he has been happily married to the same woman for 20 years and has three wonderful children. His son, Bobby, was a two- time high school wres tling champion as well as a national high school wres tling champion. He was the all-time leading scorer for Lewisburg High School in soccer shattering the old record by 31 goals. He also gradu ated high school with a 3.9 GPA and is presently a freshman at Bucknell. I am entering my 18th year as Head Wrestling Coach at Bucknell. I have produced 31 Conference champions as well as an NCAA Division I All-American. We have had 34 wrestlers represent Bucknell at the NCAA Championships in the last 15 years. Bucknell is presently ranked in the top 25 of all Division I teams in the country. I am also the Recreation Director at Bucknell. I have increased the number of activities offered by our recrea tion depart ment from 17 in 1973 to 60 in 1990. Bucknell presently has one of the highest participation rates in recreation in the country of all col leges and universities. I am the owner of two United States pat ents that are being used to produce and distrib ute goods around the world. I have also recently been nominated to be the Execu tive Director of the National Wres tling Coaches Association which represents over 50,000 wrestling coaches in the country. The above are facts about Bob Ferraro. The incident that you printed about Decathlon Athletics hap- pened in April of 1990.1 am disap pointed that Travis Elliott feels a need to dig up dirt that is five months old and then puts it on the front page of the school newspaper. If you are interested in the private lives of the coaches, then for all those coaches that do not have private enterprises, let's find out who was delinquent in paying their telephone bills in 1985. It is unfortunate that our newspaper is not more current and more responsible. I hope that in the future the Bucknellian checks thor oughly into the facts and uses better judgment before writing a damag ing story. Sincerely, Bob Ferraro,Wrestling Coach September 17,1990"
Senior praises,
Caudill letter,"To the editor: It is reassuring to see that someone else notices these things (Mr. Gordon Caudill 9/14). However, in my praise of Mr. Caudill's letter I will be succinct, and propose a course of action. If you could agree with the sentiment, and maybe even the spe cifics of Mr. Caudill's letter, don't give to Bucknell. If you must give (over and above the heinous amounts you've been forced to give in the 'Rip-Off-O'Rama' Bookstore) give to a club or a sports team or even your fraternity or sorority. Mr. Caudill's closing was correct. Students don't count. But alumni do. (But only as a potential source of income.) Make it clear now that your intentions to give are contingent upon changes you want to be made. I know its cliche but do: ""Make a difference,"" at least try to. Sincerely, Ed Coady '91 September 17,1990"

A letter to the editor? Get it,
"in print. Box C-3059,","Dear Editor, I am writing in response to Juarrannetta McNabb's letter con cerning sexism and racism on campus. Juarrannetta's letter really hit home. As a fresh man, I too was _ annoyed at the amount of unfriendliness and snobbery on cam pus. However, I never considered it __ to be related to my race or sex (I am a female minor ity). I just thought the campus was full of ignorant snobs. But perhaps what I observed was racism. To put it simply, I am not a WASP. When I first arrived at Buck nell, I was looking forward to meet ing new people -- an meet them I did. However, in most cases, the next time I saw him or her, I was blatantly ignored (despite my hello). This was not an isolated case. It happened almost all the time. It became so common that I was surprised any time my hello"

Needless to say, I have become accustomed to being ignored on campus. Now when I am introduced to new people, I don't expect them to acknowledge my presence the next time I see them. I find myself ignoring them as well. In other words, I have learned to be unfriendly here at Bucknell. So, I apologize to Juar rannetta because I may have been one of those people who failed to say hello to her. I truly am sorry. But, please understand -- that there are other people who once felt the way you do now and that there are friendly people here -- but like me, they have been condi tioned to be cold and snobby. What a wonderful thing to learn at Bucknell. --The author's name has been withheld by request. page 8 The Bucknellian September 21, 1990"

Freshman Forum,"By Richard Poll I don't know about other freshmen, co-ed halls on campus, but mine is irking me in a big way. It's not that I don't get along with my hallmates, in fact it's quite the opposite. A lifetime of stories and private jokes have been generated in the three weeks we've lived together. The problem is the ""No Hook-Up"" policy instituted by the women as a means of maintaining hall friendships forever and ever. In plain language, the chance of a non-platonic relationship is out of the question. This policy lacks foresight and can prove to be a con straint on the feelings two people may have for one another. In fairness to the women of the hall, I should briefly state their side of the story. They believe that a ""hook-up"" with a male member of the hall will lead to an uncomfortable situation because A) They will be living together for the rest of the year and can not be con fused about their feelings toward each other and B) other people will find out and jump to false conclusions. At this point most of you are probably saying to yourselves, ""is this guy serious?"" Well, I'm actually not, but the joke itself is one which has been made by many freshmen males during the last couple of weeks. The joke is harmless, but it is indicative of a situa tion which does exist and I'm not thrilled about it. Freshmen guys are in a state of limbo. Girls our age are scout ing for upperclassmen while girls younger than us do not exist in Lewisburg (at least I haven't seen any). It really doesn't bother me too much because I know that one day I'll be a senior and I'll con vince some freshmen girl that I'm really a respectable person. I do find it amusing, however, that this ornate system of deferential rela tionships has become so much a part of the college experience. One footnote: it has come to my attention that apparently, upperclass girls are looking to meet the freshmen gentlemen. I have seen little evidence of this but I'll keep an eye out for such a phenomena. At any rate, I'll have plenty of time to ""male-bond"" with all my friends who are in the same predicament as I am. I also can be grateful for the fact that I'm not living in a hall with a bunch of cheap girlfriends, but one with girls who I can trust and talk to about anything."
Need for chalk-talking on,
campus questioned,"By Laura Haden The Bucknell Student Gov ernment has passed a motion which suggests that the University admin istration ban chalk-writing on the campus sidewalks. The wording of the resolution, which passed by the narrow margin of a 14-10 vote, states that due to the availability of other means of communi cation, especially ones which do not affect the aesthetic environment of the campus, the Univer sity administration should ban chalk writing. Why would our"
BSG,propose what appears to be such a blatant offense against the Constitu tion and against our freedom of speech? To answer this
I,"would suggest we take a closer look at what is really at issue here. As the motion now reads, there are two strong arguments"
comments on change,
in chapel's Mass attendance,"By Christine Zapotocky When you notice something unusual happening on campus, something wonderful, even, you want to tell people. I have recently observed something on Sunday afternoons which I feel should be recognized. I've been attending the 4:00 p.m. Catholic Mass at Rooke Chapel, as I have for the past four years, but this fall there is a dif ference. Since my freshman year, the atten dance at Mass has been declin ing at an astounding rate. The few of us that continued to attend the ser vices arrived from the library, toting our books, and sat scattered in that huge chapel. We were like little islands, avoiding each others' space and eyes, finally sprinting to the caf when Mass was over. Attendance often picked up around finals' time, of course, and during the basketball season our starting team became the most devout Catholics on campus, but an overall lack of enthusiasm per vaded our religious lives. Religious devotion itself is quite taboo here at B.U. The relig ious organizations on campus have to use food and videos to lure mem bers, and I'm and parties to attend to do some thing that Mom and Dad aren't around to make us do anymore. Secondly, the church is unfa miliar, which can be very frustrat ing. Churches are very individual entities; each has its own text, music, even a particular order through which the service pro ceeds. It's tough for people like me, _____"

y,"in that in addition to a different prieat and parish, because I'm Byz antine--not Roman--Catholic, the Mass itself is different, too. But something is changing in the attitude of Catholics on campus. At Mass this week, I was astounded that the chapel was so packed. And sure I lost the attention of at least fifty per cent of the read ers of this letter when they hit the word ""Catholic"". When we come to college, many of us lose our interest in religion. First of all, we suddenly have too many classes, meetings,"
... we are no longer segregated by,
"cliques, but bump elbows with complete",
"strangers, who somehow become",
our friends by the end of the,
sixty-minute service.,"we are no longer segregated by cliques, but bump elbows with complete strangers, who somehow within it worth supporting. First of all, the BSG is not suggesting that there should be a ban on all expres sions of opinion on campus. It has simply requested a ban on one par ticular activity which detracts from the aesthetic appeal of our campus. There are an incredible num ber of other outlets for the groups and any other creative means they can come up with to get their point across and to rally support. There is certainly a medium here for every point of view. Another significant part of this argument is the magnitude of this change. How many groups would a ban on chalk-talking become our friends by the end of the sixty-minute service. The choir sings a greater portion of the Mass, and the entire congregation sings with them, which is a modern-day miracle in itself. More students directly participate in Mass than ever before, as ministers, readers, and ushers. And the bread that is used for Communion is baked by students on a Friday night, no less, while their friends are get ting ready for a wild night at the fraternities."
I,"think most of the credit for this ""rebirth"" must go to Father Angelo, a new face on campus. His enthusiasm has been contag ious, and he's obviously wasted no time implementing his ideas for creating a ""com munity"" of Cath olics. Person ally, I'd also like to believe that this enthusiasm has always been within all of us, too, but because of the indiffer ence towards religious devo tion on this cam pus, it's been hibernating and only needed a bit of coaxing to be reawakened. Why am I writing this? Maybe because I think there should be more of an acceptance of relig ious devotion on campus. And even more than that. I'm hoping to inspire a few Catholic students who might have tried on this campus to express their views. Those who claim that this ban is a clear violation of individ ual freedom of speech are just denying the fact that the groups who use chalk-talk still have access to many other forms of communi cation. I feel especially strongly on this point, as it is my sole job as opinions editor to print the views of the Bucknell community. Along with the opinions page of The Bucknellian, groups may speak through other publications on cam pus such as the Catalyst, Sentinel, or Bucknell Forum, through signs in the U.C., signs in dorms, on the campus radio station, through fly ers, mailings/notices of meetings, affect? Some will argue that it is irrelevant whether it affects two groups or twenty, but I believe that it is relevant. Obviously, there are many other means to communicate on campus and groups arc taking advantage of them, as the current number of chalk-writers is minimal. The second aspect of this motion which I feel deserves atten- tion is the issue of whether the mess caused by chalk-talking is aesthetically pleasing. Bucknell has a beautiful and well-cared for campus. The administration spends a great deal of money keeping the grounds and buildings in excellent condition. When individuals write their temporary grafitti all over the sidewalks, it detracts from the environment. These writings often remain for several days, long after the blood drive has already occurred, and the feminist quotes have been read and re-read and responded to obscenely and angrily. The rain comes, as it always does, and rather than wash ing away the chalk, it usually smears and -- # blurs. We are then left with illegible mark ings and a brightly-colored mess. Another aspect of this argument involves the responses to the writings. Last semester, Buck nell had some serious problems with responses to chalk writings. Many of them were obscene, hurtful messages, which the University had to come along and clean up. I understand that it is not the groups who currently have permission from the University to chalk-talk that arc writing these vile things, but the obscenity is in response to their writings. If we eliminate the provocation of obscenity on the campus sidewalks, we eliminate the obscenity on the sidewalk. There is just no need for the community to have to see this mess every day on the academic quad when there are many other means available on campus in which to express one's opinion. the Bucknell religious pro grams at one time and decided to give it up out of frustration. Maybe if they hear that it's dif- ________ ferent now, they might try it again. After all, I'm planning to do a little bread baking pretty soon myself..."
Student addresses Caudill's,
criticism through open letter,
What kind of response do you expect,
from our community when you make,
such an,
incredibly hostile letter your means of,
communication?,"By Mark Leister I was shocked by last week's letter, from Mr. Gordon R. Caudill to President Gary Sojka, con cerning the vast number of injuries that have appar ently been inflicted upon the poor carcass of Mr. Caudill by Bucknell University. He has obviously been struck to the quick and can think of no better recourse than to pen a fer- vent attack at the University community. I would like to address this piece to Mr. Caudill; however, he has made it all too clear that he wishes there to be ""no more communications from Bucknell University."" Thus, I am forced to write an open letter to him with the scant possibility of it one day catching his eye. Mr. Caudill, You are obviously a very angry man who is feeling a great deal of dis gust with "" Bucknell Uni versity. But are there no more con structive ave nues by which _ -- to make your point? What kind of response do you expect from our community when you make such an incredibly hostile letter your means of communication? I must confess that you appear to hold no bias; you denounced the Uni versity quite liberally across the boards. You criti cize the students, stating that we appear to be ""prod- ucts of poorly taught curricula."" Thank you, Mr. Caudill, for your wonderfully constructive criticism. A great many of the students at this university do quite well in society's open waters without floun dering too aimlessly. You attack the administration quite heatedly; unfortunately, effective ways to your literary form revolves around figh- tin' words: ""...ad nau seam ...ball and chain... dead wood... mcwlings...."" There are more appro- express your priate and sentiments. I am very much in support of free speech, sir, but I do not agree with your unnecessarily bitter banter. There is a big difference between endeavors that simply raise a fuss and those that genuinely effect positive change. I am sure that there are oth ers like you who have found prob lems with the ""Bucknell bubble,"" and I feel their reactions are i important and neces sary to the growth of the University. I only hope that they can find more construc tive paths by which to make their opinions known. Perhaps through communication , rather than defa mation, they can encourage change."

"""Robocop II"" falls short","By Lee Guzofski Hello Bucknellians and welcome to the fabulous world of cinema where magic and reality come together and create a visual smorgasbord of... oh, the hell with it. Not that I'm against a wordy and circuitous intro like this but, the movie I wish to discuss is Robocop 2 and, to be honest, it isn't worthy of that much effort. However, for the glory of Bucknell and the teeming hordes of movie reviewer groupies everywhere, I shall press ever onward... Robocop 2 is a predictable romp in which our ""hero"" is back; but this time in a world plagued by a vicious narcotic called ""Nuke."" He tries to stem the traffic of this drug by hunting down the evil Caine, psychotic cult leader and all-around meanie. At any rate (and to make a miserable story short), Robocop's circuits get repro grammed, turning him into an overly courteous Roboweenie. Then Caine's mind is placed into a super metallic monster. Of course, the movie ""climaxes"" with Roboputz fighting a destructive battle with the Caine-boL Okay, look, I enjoyed the first Robocop offering. I'll even admit that against my better judgement This film, however, was complete and total maggot-ridden garbage. It was a slime trail tracked across the face of modern cinema by the slug of gratuitous violence and gore. This movie was a non-stop documentary on the merits of turning blood into movie dollars. Really, it is an upsetting statement on modem society and I for one, I for one... I for one am getting carried away. If you are a fanatic for gladiator films and/or biology documentaries such as ""The Miracle of Blood"" or ""Your Insides Out,"" then this is the film for you. However, if you're some one who might enjoy something with, oh say... ANY SORT OF WORTH, then you can (and should) ignore this film. In summation, this film was doggie doodle. Thank you; have a nice yesterday and a pleasant next Thursday. Editor's note: Lee Guzofski will review a newly released movie each week in the Arts and Entertainment section of The Bucknellian. \ ______________________________________________________ /"

Musicians come together to aid the Romanian Angel Appeal,"By Jon Elliot The late 1980s saw the crea tion of a phenomenon which linked well known musicians with a needy charity, of which Live-Aid, Farm- Aid and Amnesty International were a few of the more popular concerts which drew the world's attention. The 1990s, but a few months old, has witnessed the release of three, quite impressive albums which have followed the examples set by Live-Aid and its spinoffs. Along with Roger Water's The Wall: Live In Berlin and the gala production of Knebworth '90, both of which were produced to benefit charitable causes, Olivia Harrison, Barbara Bach, Yoko Ono and Linda McCartney have collaborated to compile an all-star album dedicated to the long-term aid of the thou sands of Romanian orphans who suffer from deprivation. Nobody's Child: Romanian Angel Appeal (Warner Bros.), like most compilations of it's kind, is bound to have it's ups and downs, yet from the Bee Gees to Guns N' Roses little fault can be found with the choice of artists and song selection. Oddly enough, this string of fifteen songs has never been released prior to the production of this album. There is a creatively diverse collection of artists who have contributed their talents to this effort The music ranges from the Traveling Wilburys title track, which is their first piece of released material since the untimely death of fellow Wilbury Roy Orbison, to a beautiful ballad composed and per formed by the legendary Stevie Wonder entitled ""Feeding Off The Love Of The Land."" To the avid late night televi sion viewer, two of the pieces may be of particular interest The first being ""Ain't That Peculiar"" per formed by Mike & The Mechanics with Paul Shaefer and The World's Most Dangerous Band recorded live on ""Late Night with David Letterman."" The second, and rather interesting work is the live version of the Simon and Garfunkel classic ""Homeward Bound"" as performed by Paul Simon and George Harri son on ""Saturday Night Live."" When Guns N' Roses per formed ""Civil War"" at Farm Aid IV earlier this year, many questioned their song selection saying that it's relevance, along with what G & R stood for, had no bearing on the plight of the American farmer. That may have been a valid argument. But I feel that few critics of Axel Rose and company can argue with the direct affiliation between the deprived orphans in Romania and the meaning behind ""Civil War."" Other highlights on this musically and socially concious recording include previously unre leased works by Elton John (Medi cine Man), Van Morrison (Won derful Remark), the new and improved sound of Billy Idol (Lovechild), Eric Clapton (That Kind of Woman), Edie Brickell & The New Bohemians (Big Day Lit tle Boat), and the album finale ""With A Little Help From My Friends"" performed by Ringo Starr and His All Star Band (including Levon Helm and Rick Danko of The Band, Joe Walsh, Nils Lof- gren. Dr. John and Clarence Clemmons). As we have seen in recent years, musical compilations, whether good or bad, have never sold considerably well in a market where many times the consumer chooses a particular work based on the artists name rather than the group's musical talent (this is evi dent with the recent success of the New Kids On the Block). But no matter if you buy this album because of the names on the jacket cover, or because you appreciate over 60 minutes of diverse, cultu rally concious music, I think your money will be well spent. Musical compilations of such depth and meaning are hard to come by, and with the exception of possibly one or two cuts. Nobody's Child may fall into that huge pile of albums, creative or otherwise, which won't get the needed air play to gain the recognition it deserves. Courtesy of Warner Brothers Produced in 1990, ""Nobody's Child"" contains new releases from sev eral world-renowned musicians such as The Traveling Wilburys, Gun's N' Roses, Stevie Wonder and The Bee Gee's.

Art Review,
Exhibit appeals to,
philosophical artists,"By Cynthia Levinson Staff Writer ""Primal Denouments: The Dante Painters"" opened in the Cen ter Gallery last Friday. The opening was proceeded by a dinner and a panel discussion, both of which were in conjuction the 15th Annual Conference of Merleau-Ponty Circle. Merleau-Ponty was a French philosopher who maintained the belief that painting is an outlet which enables the artist to vision and existence through the medium of paint. The Dante painters are a group of five New York artists who meet weekly at the Cafe Dante. The works are quite varied, and seem to be unified only by their common belief in the Mer leau-Ponty philosophy. The panel discussion which prececded the gallery opening was attended by Bucknell staff and faculty members as well as mem bers of the conference. The panel was comprised of the artists and a number of philosophers. Although the discussion was interesting, it was a bit too lengthy, and the phi losophers lost the bulk of their audience early on in the discussion. Thus, much of the audience missed the opportunity to hear the artists speak about their works. The exhibit itself shows that the artists are commited to express ing themselves through their art and doing so in an abstract fashion. Their art may appeal to some view ers more than others, but it should convey to everyone that it is art with philosophy and intent behind it"

Field hockey registers,
first win at Georgetown,"By Scooter Van Kirk and Julie McCausland Staff Writers The Bucknell women's field hockey team defeated the George town Hoyas 3-2 last Sunday in overtime, capturing its first win of the season. After a disappointing 0-4 start, the squad was ripe for a vic tory as they clashed with the highly touted Hoyas. ""The game started out slug gishly,"" attested Bison Coach Jen Averill. ""We made several foolish mistakes in the first half."" Because of this lapse the Hoyas jumped to a quick 1-0 lead on a goal by Georgetown forward Liza Fox. Less than one minute later, Steph Carfley '93 put in what coach Averill described as ""an amazing goal."" The ball was crossed in front of the goal by Sue Wells '93 and deflected into the upper comer by Carfley, who used a difficult reverse stick move to tie the game at 1-1. The score remained unchanged until the end of the first half when the Bison conceded a goal to end the half with the score 2-1 in favor of the Hoyas. The Bison came out much stronger in the second half, and played without the errors that had plagued them throughout the first half. It was not until late in the second half that the Bison were able to pull even on a goal by co captain Jeanette Aurand '92, off an assist from A1 Baldwin '94. Another Hoya drive on goal was rejected by the tenacious Bison defense to end regulation in a 2-2 lie, sending the game into overtime. Georgetown had an opportu nity to score early in the extra ten minute period, but failed to capital ize. With three minutes left in over- timethe Bison were awarded a cor ner at the Georgetown goal. The teamwork of veteran cor ner specialists Meghan Clark '92 and Katrina Mueller '93 resulted in the winning score by Amber Baxter '92, who sent her beeline drive careening by a helpless Hoya goalie for Lady Bison victory. Bucknell was not as fortunate fortunate the previous day, falling to non-conference foe American, 4- 2 . The Bison initiated the scor ing with an unassisted goal by Baldwin. This did not prove to be an obstacle for the American team who reciprocated with two goals in the first half to take a one-goal lead at halftime. ""American surprised us with their speed,"" stated Averill. ""There was confusion and we had trouble containing their offensive drives."" The second half was a one sided match, with American main taining and lengthening their lead. The first half momentum carried the home team into the sec ond period, where they immedi ately scored on a penalty shot. Buckncll's second and last goal of the day came on an unas sisted effort by Wells. In the waning minutes of the half American scored an insurance goal to clinch the win, 4-2. As Averill reflected on the weekend, she explained that the dif ference in play between Saturday and Sunday was the team's ability to anticipate the plays at Georgetown. Bucknell will travel to Holy Cross and face their first Patriot League opponent, who according to Averill, looks strong and has shown great promise so far this season. This will be the first ever match-up between the Bison and Crusaders, and following a week of hard practice, Bucknell hopes to be well prepared for an intense match. By Mark Abrahamsen Staff Writer Dynasty is a word that is often overused today in the world of sport, as long and legitimate runs of supremacy arc few and far between. But one of the most impressive true dynasties in NCAA history concluded Saturday at Bucknell. Last weekend the Bison men's cross-country team had its record of 167 consecutive dual- meet victories snapped, when it lost to a powerful UConn. Though many casual sports fans only care about the Univer sity's revenue-producing teams, football and basketball, the cross country team's domination over opponents since 1974 has gone largely unnoticed by the typical Bucknell onlooker. During the historic run, the Bison have rolled to 15 consecutive East Coast Conference champion ships, and have placed in the top three of the prestigious IC4A post season championship meet six times. Coach Art Gulden, who has held the Bison reins throughout the streak, played down the signifi cance of the record despite its impressive figures. ""The streak wasn't very important,"" assessed Gulden, ""What really matters is how we'll be running at the end of October (in the Patriot League Championships). Hopefully we'll react well to the defeat, and perhaps the loss will prepare us more for future meets better than the easy wins."" The question of whether the Bison can recover will be put to test in just two weeks, as they travel south for the West Virginia Classic. There Bucknell will run against powerful Pittsburgh, the same school who nearly ended the streak in 1988. In that meet hosted by the Panthers, the Bison squeaked by with a close 26-29 victory. One has to look way back to Oct. 5, 1974, when Bucknell last lost a dual-meet. On that date in Philadelphia, a tough Lehigh team pulled out a close victory. The Bison that year were co captained by Frank Carroll '74 and Bruce Hyde '74, who led the team to eight consecutive wins after the Lehigh defeat, including second- place finishes at the E.C.C. and IC4A championships. The following year Bucknell got sweet revenge against Lehigh, defeating the Engineers 27-30. The Bison cruised through E.C.C.'s, and captured their first 1C4A title Bucknell duplicated the double championship in 1980. The Bison almost saw their streak severed in 1985, when they faced a very tough Iona team in New York City. As the meet went down to the final runner on each squad, Buck nell held on for a grinding 28-29 triumph. But for most of the 167 wins, the Bison just ran away from all of its competitors, and though the record streak is over, Bucknell will continue to put out an incredi ble group of runners at every meet. It's not often when Gulden has had to explain a defeat, but the creator of this dynasty offers the following perspective: ""You're never prepared to handle something of this nature. But we'll see if we can turn it into something positive. If we can implement what we've learned from it, we should come out a better team."" Perhaps a burden has now been lifted from the runners, and even though the university may never witness a streak of that size ever again, Bucknell cross-country is still sitting comfortably on top of the Patriot League. As for the next 16 years, only time will tell if the Bison can main tain their standard of excellence that has kept them at the pinnacle of their sport for the past two decades."
Army fights off,
wom en's tennis,Peter Ho/The Bucknellian Kathleen Sullivan '92 bombards her opponents with a mammoth spike. The Lady Bison finished fourth out of a five-team invitational tournament at Bucknell last weekend.
Volleyball places fourth,
in Bucknell Invitational,"By Christopher Mosunic The women's tennis squad dropped its record to 1-1 last Satur day in a close match against the Lady Cadets of Army, 5-4. Women's tennis is a new var sity sport at Army, and the Lady Bison did not know what to expect. As it turned out, the Lady Cadets were a force to be reckoned with. The most grueling match of the afternoon involved Kymm Carl son '94 and Army's top player. Though Carlson lost the first set 6-0, she battled back in the second. They were neck and neck for the entire set before won the tie breaker 18-16, giving her the match. During the match Carlson protested three line calls made by the Army player, as she felt on the short end of the stick in the disputes. Carlson commented, ""I was really nervous the first set and let her get away, but by the second my game was at its height and if it hadn't been for those calls on my set points, I think I could have run away with it."" Buckncll's strong singles play was highlighted by Mary Ann Benack '92 and Karen Stagliano '92. Both players defeated their Army counterparts in straight sets. ""I just got up on her and didn't let down,"" said Stagliano. These two powerhouses then combined their skills and put away their opponents in a doubles match, winning 6-1,6-3. Coach Rose Ewan was impressed with Bucknell's performance. She assessed, ""4-5 is very respectable against Army. They were just a little better off of the mark. If it weren't for the nerves, we might have won."" The Lady Bison will face two Patriot League rivals this weekend, as they travel to Lafayette tomor row and Lehigh on Sunday. Coach Ewan commented, ""Lehigh is just a notch above Lafayette but they're both extremely tough. If we're a little more aggressive and trust our game, we can win both of these matches."" Photo by Jon Wise The women's tennis team lost to Army 5-4 last Saturday, drop ping its record to 1-1 on the year. The team's match against Lock Haven on Wednesday was rained out. The Lady Bison look to go over .500 as they travel to face Lafayette and Lehigh tomorrow and Sunday."
Write for Sports,", y E *t, 1520 By Todd Bianchine Staff Writer Bucknell hosted its ninth annual invitational volleyball tour nament last weekend, looking to post some big wins in a strong field of competition. Loyola (Md.), took top honors, with Bucknell finishing in fourth position. Rounding out the field, Rider and Geveland State second and third, while St. Francis finished last. ""We were really psyched for Loyola and Cleveland State since they both beat us at the Loyola tour nament,"" said co-captain Kara Foro- sisky '92. ""We knew if we played well we could beat them."" Before Bucknell could get their hands on Loyola and Cleve land State, they had to deal with Rider College. Bucknell came into the match all fired up, but so did the Lady Broncs. The first two games fell in favor of Rider 16-14, 15-10. However, this didn't break the spirit of the Lady Bison as they held on to win the third game 16-14. Rider crushed stopped Bucknell's come back hopes, though, by taking the fourth game 15-9. Bucknell had 45 kills in the match, led by their two captains, Forosisky with 13 and Kristen Colbert '91 with 10. ""It was a really good match for us,"" said first year coach Cindy Opalski. ""We just fell into slumps at times where we weren't passing the ball that well and that's all they needed to stay on top."" The next opponent, Loyola, had little difficulty with Bucknell, as the Lady Bison dropped three straight games to Loyola 15-10,15- 10,15-6. Loyola, led by its two all tournament selections, senior setter/ hitter Gina Iarocci and sophomore hitter Mary Percoco, took advan tage of Buckncll's nineteen recep tion errors and seven ball handling errors to seal the victory for Loyola. After getting the early part of Saturday morning off, Bucknell had time to reflect back upon previ ous matches. Coach Opalski thought it was time for a change in the offensive scheme. The Lady Bison switched their standard 5-1 offense, 5 hitters and 1 setter, to a 6-2 offense, 6 hitters and 2 setters. ""What it does is give our team a more optioned attack,"" said Coach Opalski. ""Instead of going to Dee (Scinta '92) all the time we can now go to Mary (Jordan '93) as well. It takes some of the pressure off Dec and allows us to utilize her defensive skills a bit more."" ""I love it,"" stated Jordan. ""It's a lot more responsibility, but it gives us more options."" The offensive change seemed to work well. Bucknell rolled to a 3-1 victory over St. Francis and seven different players recorded at least three kills in the match. Lead ing the way was junior hitter Kath leen Sullivan who had seven kills, four aces, and four digs. See VOLLEYBALL, page 12 S e p te m b e r 21, 1990"

Young golf team looking,
experience; finishes 15th,"By Jamie Diaferia The varsity golf team opened the 1990 season with a fifteenth place finish in a field of twenty- four participants at the Franklin & Marshall Sheraton tournament over the weekend. The tournament, held in Lancaster, was ""encouraging"" according to Coach Tommy Thompson, because it demonstrated that despite having a young team, the Bison golfers could still be competitive in a difficult league. While he does concede that there is room for improvement through experience, he sees no rea son why the team cannot perform well in the upcoming Georgetown Tournament in Fredericksburg, Virginia. The Bucknell team began the tournament on Sunday by shooting a combined 324, which was enough to place them thirteenth behind Delaware, Georgetown, and Seton Hall, among others. Captain Mike Smigie '92, and Don Hansen '94 both led the team in the opening round with a score of 77, while another freshman, Doug Dollen- berg, shot an impressive 80 to help the Bison cause. Dave Fries '93 and Scott Miller '93 struggled a bit in the early rounds, however, shoot ing 90 and 92 respectively. The next day, conditions on the course became a factor, as high winds often led to unpredictable shots. Fortunately, the team was able to adjust to the change, as Fries, Han sen and Dollenberg all shot 83. Meanwhile, Miller and Smigie shot 82 and 88 respectively. Coach Thompson was pleased with the performance of the team because he feels that despite the fact that he has a young team, they handled themselves well and played like a team with experience. ""I'm encouraged,"" he said. ""We still have to develop some consis tency in all five travelling players, but I feel that, on the whole, there is a lot to be pleased about"" He also feels that despite the loss of senior John Ingham, two time all"
to gain,
at F&M,"East Coast Conference player, this year's team is stronger. ""We defi nitely have more depth this year,"" said Thompson. ""I have more con fidence in our one through five players."" This Friday and Saturday the Bison will participate in the Georgetown Invite. Coach Thomp son is excited at the prospects for his team, although he has no partic ular goals that he would like to achieve. ""I am really just looking for steady improvement in all five players. We are thinking more in terms of the spring season, and not so much how we do this fall. We are a hard working team, and we should do all right"""
Women's soccer still winless after,
2-1 loss to Nittany Lions yesterday,"By Anne Taback In women's soccer action yesterday afternoon, Penn State defeated Bucknell 2-1, keeping the Lady Bison winless this season at 0-4. All of the scoring came in the first half, as Bucknell's Amy Krause '91 tallied the opening goal just 3:36 into the game, giving the Lady Bison an early one goal advantage. Krause's score came on the assist of midfielder Christina Baselga '91. The Nittany Lions were undaunted, however, as Charity Grims scored the equalizer at 16:32. Just 12 minutes later Penn State's Jeanine Baldino scored what turned out to be the game winner on a ball that sailed past the outstretched arms of goaltender Kim Fekel '93. The Lady Bison hope to turn things around as they travel to Phil adelphia for tomorrow's game against the UPenn Quakers. Last Saturday Bucknell fell to the Delaware Blue Hens by a score of 3-1. Bucknell fell behind early in the game when the Blue Hens were able to score at 13:00. They capital ized again on a comer kick with just one minute remaining in the half to take a 2-0 advantage into the locker room. Co-captain Dana Esse '91 believed that the second goal ""was a good shot, it was just over Kim's head."" According to Coach Toby Lovecchio, ""it's difficult to get behind 2-0 and that's what we've done all three of our games."" How ever, Bucknell took advantage of an opportunity given to them in the second half when the ball was kicked out of bounds by the Blue Hens. Forward Krause was able to score off a comer kick at 21:36, closing the gap to 2-1. According to both Esse and Krause, the Lady Bison played sluggishly in the first half, but improved as the game went on, until the Blue Hens secured the game with an insurance goal late in the contest, giving Del aware a 3-1 victory. Krause felt that even though Bucknell lost the game, ""it was pretty even in the second half. We put more pressure on them."" Although Lovecchio feels that Delaware played a better game and deserved to win, he is not dis couraged. ""I have confidence in our team,"" he said. ""They're working hard, they don't give up, they try hard and want to win."" He added that the squad is improving with each game it plays. Esse feels that part of the problem is lack of confidence. ""It's just a mental problem,"" said Esse. ""But we're really up and we know we've been improving a lot We've just played three really good teams."" One definite major problem that the Lady Bison are having is the lack of speed. This week, Lovecchio has tried different work outs in order to teach his team other things that will hopefully make up for the speed deficiency. He wants the team ""to be able to think before the other team can react fast enough. We might not be faster but we can be quicker in movements."" He added, ""it's tough to replace speed--we'll do it any way we can."" The Delaware game was very difficult for the defensive players, who were continually being chal lenged. Lovecchio commented, ""they were doing all they could do, but to keep it up for 90 minutes is tough."" Goalkeeper Fekel played an outstanding game with 18 saves. Lovecchio also added that right back Genine Streeper '92, who had recently been injured, played an excellent game as well. Lovecchio feels that the team has to work on stopping high shots, or eliminate those shots entirely. ""The team is young,"" he said, ""and a lot of things I'm trying to teach them are new to them. I'm impressed with the way some girls have picked their game up a notch--if they all can do that it'll help."" Looking ahead to tomorrow at Penn, the Quakers are the only Ivy League school with a non- varsity women's soccer team, although Lovecchio feels that they will be very competitive."

""We've never played them before and we'll be playing on astroturf, so we'll need to make a lot of adjustments. We'll need better ball control, and I won't hesitate to make personnel changes if the situation arises.""

Atlanta to be sight of,
'96 Summer games,"By Mark Abrahamsen Staff Writer Atlanta was awarded the 1996 Summer Olympics at an announcement made in Tokyo Tuesday by International Olympic Committee President Juan Antonio Samaranch. The decision marks the third time in 16 years that the United States will host an Olympic Games. Lake Placid was the home for the Winter Games in 1980, highlighted by America's ""Miracle on Ice;"" Los Angeles was the site for the 1984 Summer Games, memorable for Carl Lewis' four Gold Medals, Mary Lou Rctton's gymnastics triumph, and the U.S. basketball team steamrolling past opponents on its way to easily win ning the Gold Medal. As Atlantans partied in the streets of the city's Underground entertainment and shopping com plex, Mayor Maynard Jackson pro claimed, ""I feel like an exclama tion point has just been placed on the life of our city. We won't let the world down."" Atlanta's effort began in 1988, when the United States Olympic Committee chose the ""capital of the South"" over Minne- apolis-St. Paul.

Volleyball,"From page 10 By the time the Cleveland State game rolled around fatigue had caught up with the Lady Bison. Bucknell could only muster one block the entire match. They also ran into problems passing the ball which negated the effectiveness of the 6-2 offense, plus they encoun tered some problems at the line as they gave up seven service errors in the match. 'The team's attitude is really positive and we're playing together a lot better, plus our new offense makes us quite varied. All we need to do is improve upon our serve receive and try to keep our emo tional level consistently high."" Individual leaders for the tournament were Forosisky who compiled 31 kills over the tourna ment and had a 23% hitting per centage. Forosisky was also the only Lady Bison named to the all tournament team. Sullivan also had a strong tournament as she recorded 24 kills and a 36% hiuing ment turned out to be a bargain. The announcement will generate approximately $3.5 billion into the state's economy. For a sum mer fortnight over half a million spectators, 16,500 athletes and coaches, and 6,000 journalists will attend the festivities. The southern mecca had been locked in a battle with five other cities trying to receive the bid: Athens, Greece; Toronto, Canada; Belgrade, Yugoslavia; Melbourne, Australia; and Man chester, England. In addition to having access to the Omni and Fulton-County Stadium, the city has many new facilities currently under construc tion or in the works to be built before '96. A 75,000-seat Georgia Dome will house basketball and gymnastics; an Olympic Stadium accommodating the opening/ closing ceremonies, equestrian, soccer, and track and field will seat 85,000; a natatorium for swimming and diving; and a velo drome for cycling. The IOC's decision ended any serious hopes for Salt Lake City's bid for hosting the Winter Games in 1998 (to be announced in 1991), as Olympic officials have traditionally been hesitant for awarding the Games to the same country in back-to-back Olympics. percentage. Scinta and Jordan combined for 78 assists on the tournament. On Tuesday the Lady Bison tried to rebound from the long weekend in a match against the University of Maryland in Balti more County. Bucknell wasn't on top of its game, however, as they fell to UMBC 15-6 15-10 15-8. Coach Opalski was forced to go back to the 5-1 offense as Bucknell couldn't get its passing game going the first two games. In the third game, Bucknell held off UMBC at 10-6 when Colbert came up with three straight blocks, but the Lady Bison couldn't get their serving game going as they struggled with a 30% point/serve ratio. ""You can't win serving 30%,"" sad Opalski. ""I feel we played a little better than the scores indicate. UMBC is a strong club which executes very well. We've got a week to rest and work on things before we play Villanova, so I think we'll be in good shape."" t page 12"

"Football dominates Lafayette, 24-14","Bucknellian File Photo Shown in action last year, wide receiver Lester Erb '91 hauls in another recption. E rb this season has four touchdowns to his credit in Bucknell's first two games. By Scott Brown Staff Writer Buckncil scored ten points in the second half off two Lafayette turnovers to win 24-14 in its first Patriot League match-up of the season. The victory, which moved the Bison to 1-1 overall, was sparked by a ball control ground game and a solid defensive effort. The Bison backfield rushed for a total of 272 yards, led by Brian Henesey '92, who ran for 103 yards, and Craig Cavlovic '91, who rushed for 87 yards on just 14 carries in his first game at fullback after being moved from linebacker. Coach Lou Maranzana assessed the move by saying ""Cav lovic played fullback in the pre season, and Jeff Wall '93 and Char- ron Anderson '93 were banged up. He did well in there and sparked the offense in practice. We started the game with it, and it worked well."" Bucknell struck first in the contest with a 63-yard drive in five plays. The score came on a 15-yard pass play from Todd Hatajik '91 to a wide-open Matt Walsh '93, who scampered down the sideline for the touchdown. That made the score 7-0 with 8:10 to go in the first quarter. The touchdown pass was set up by four straight running plays, including a 13-yard sweep by Walsh, and a 32-yard gain up the middle by Cavlovic to Lafay ette's 18-yard line. Following unsuccessful drives by both teams, Lafayette took the ball on Bucknell's 42-yard line. Tom Costello, the Leopards' leading rusher, took a pass from quarterback Tom Kirchhoff and broke a tackle before he was even tually brought down on the six-yard line. Three plays later, Kirchhoff again connected, this time on a 7- yard touchdown to Dave Baird to tie the score at seven with 3:48 left to play in the first quarter. That ended the scoring in a first period which was completely dominated by the Bison. They amassed 125 yards on the ground while holding the ball for over ten and a half minutes o f the quarter. The second quarter was rather uneventful until, with just over five minutes left in the half, Lafayette's Jim Hodson missed a 44 yard field goal wide to the left. Bucknell took possession and Hatajik completed a 20-yard strike up the middle to Je ff Pape '92. But two plays later, Dennis Barnes '91 fumbled after catching a Hatajik pass. Lafayette recovered the ball on its own 46-yard line and went five plays in 43 seconds for its sec ond touchdown of the afternoon. All of the yardage came via the pass, with the last a six-yarder caught by Dave Duer in the midst of three Bison defenders in the end zone. Bucknell regained posses sion, down 14-7, with just over a minute to play. The kickoff was fumbled initially by Cavlovic but picked up by Dan Scocca '91, who returned the ball to the 39. Hatajik began the ""two-minute drill"" with two short completions to Bames and Scocca of nine and eight yards respectively. After an overthrown ball, Hatajik dropped back, scrambled left and hit Scocca for a 23-yard gain. Bucknell used a time out to stop the clock and discuss strategy. The decision worked perfectly as Hatajik, on a play action fake to Walsh, connected with Lester Erb '91 in the left comer of the end zone for a 21-yard touchdown to tie the game at fourteen with only 16 seconds left in the half. The Bison run defense per formed admirably in the first half, as the Leopards were held to just 12 yards rushing on 11 attempts. Coach Maranzana was ini tially concerned that the defense wouldn't play well after Cavlovic, the leading tackier last year, was moved to offense. ""The defense would certainly suffer without him. There was slack to be taken up, but we were pleased with the way Kevin Kane '93 played last week, and there were other linebackers that can help us. It also helps us that our defensive line continues to improve."" While the third quarter did By Chad Bown The men's soccer team started the week off well with a 1-0 win over Lehigh on Saturday before suffering their first defeat of the season, a 3-0 loss to Drexel on Tuesday. The Bison travelled to Beth lehem, Pennsylvania last Saturday to face Patriot League rival Lehigh. The teams played to an even score in the first half, with Bucknell find ing itself in control of most of the action, yet unable to capitalize on any scoring opportunities. Forward Dave Moser '91 scored the lone goal for Bucknell early in the second half on a quick drive that found the ball nestled cleanly in the upper right hand cor ner of the Lehigh net The team then struggled through the rest of the second half but managed to hang on for the victory. ""W e were lucky in that we were outplayed for a good bit of the second half,"" said Coach Reynolds. ""We need to apply and sustain bet ter pressure of our own over the full ninety minutes."" Bad luck finally caught up to the Bison on Tuesday in the form of Drexel University. Bucknell con tinued its road trip with a stop in Philadelphia to play what Reynolds called ""a good team that came at us not produce any score, Bucknell played opportunistically in the fourth quarter. Bill Higgins *91 intercepted a Kirchhoff pass at the Bison two-yard line and returned it 23 yards to the Bucknell 25. The Bison then ate up 8:07 on the clock using 17 plays to eventually take the lead 21-14 when Hatajik rolled right and connected with Pape for a four-yard TD. The completion was Hata- jik 's third touchdown pass of the day. Bucknell again intercepted Kirchhoff just three plays later. The By Jennifer Walsh The Bucknell men's and women's cross-country teams both exhaled a sigh of disappointment after last Saturday's meets while they inhaled a breath of determina tion to carry them through the rest of their season, as the men lost to a phenomenal team from UConn, and the women dropped races to both George Mason and UConn. For the men's team, the loss was particularly frustrating and his toric, as it marked the first time that a Bison cross-country team did not win a dual-meet in 16 years. The dynasty ended followingl67 con secutive victories in dual-meets. The Bison lost to UConn 36-22, while also defeating Manhattan and Rutgers by identical 15-50 scores. UConn posted the top three finish ers, with runner Andy Ball coming in first overall with a time o f 25:04. Jason Cahilly '92 was the leading Bucknell finisher, arriving fourth at the finish line, thirteen seconds behind Ball. Following Cahilly were teammates Matt Deardoff '92 and Norbert Berenyi '91, who fin ished fifth and sixth, respectively. Naturally, one of the major concerns now facing the men's team after its loss pertains to how they will handle the defeat, and what possible influence it will have on the rest of its season. Cahilly said, ""The race and streak are over, past, gone, history, old news. W e've got to look ahead. W e've got some big meets coming up, and we have to look at the future."" Cross-country Coach Art ""W e hung in there tough in the first half,"" continued Reynolds, ""but we were flat"" The score approaching halftime was still 0-0, and the team was in pretty good shape. Had it not been for a tough break when a Ken Gulick '91 shot on goal hit the post, the Bison may have found themselves with a lead and the momentum heading into the second half. Early in the second half, goal keeper Mark Wrigley '94 lost his footing on the slick turf and allowed the first goal scored by a Bucknell opponent this season. It gave Drexel a 1-0 lead and proved to be the only score the team would need. Drexel added two more goals later in the game to seal the victory. ""Only a couple of our players played a real, solid game,"" indicated Reynolds. ""Next to [Chad] Heilman ['91], [Brandon] Poe ['91], and [Kirk] Lorie ['91], we didn't play up to our potential."" ""Maybe the loss will opeh our eyes to some of our weak nesses,"" Reynolds continued. ""We make too many unnecessary turno vers and we have poor ball control. W e need to improve our heading technique and we have to have more movement off the ball."" ""We need better leadership from a few of the players on the team,"" Reynolds said. ""Besides the captains, we need some of the hero this time was Trevor Smith '91, who had also intercepted a pass earlier in the day. The Bison took possession at Lafayette's 38-yard-line and drove down to the 13. The drive was sparked by Walsh, who found a hole up the middle before cutting right and gaining 13 yards on the play. The Bison eventually capital ized off the Leopard miscue as Todd Krutchkoff '91 nailed a 30 yard field goal to give the Bison a 24-14 win. Bucknell will be at home Gulden also expressed the idea that the most important thing is to get on with the season. ""The streak isn't very impor tant,"" stated Gulden, ""because all early meets are just preparation for later on in the season. I'm not excited about losing to UConn, but the world didn't end for me or for the team. I think the key to this race will be how we react to the loss."" Gulden also stressed the need to put things in proper perspective. ""Most people don't know how good they (UConn) really are. They're at least one of the top ten in the nation, and I think the only people who realize right now just how good they are, are their coach and me."" Among other positive factors from the race. Gulden also cited that UConn, not an East Coast Con ference member, is not Bucknell's primary competition. According to Gulden, ""It's only important to beat them in November to avenge our loss. Will they still be this much better than us in November? No. W e'll be a whole lot closer."" Saturday's meet was a bit of a surprise for the Lady Bison, as teams from UConn and George Mason defeated Bucknell 29-27 and 33-22, respectively. ""W e were pretty close to George Mason-- we probably should've beat them. UConn sur prised us. We didn't think they were that good,"" commented Gul den. He also remarked that Buck nell runner Kelly Marsh '91 had run very well for her team, but again stressed that the reaction to the loss will be the most important younger guys to step in and encourage each other. W e need to take a more positive approach to some of our games this season."" When asked about tomor- tomorrow to face Columbia Univer sity. Last year, the Bison won eas ily 27-12 on the road and are favored again in this year's contest. Cavlovic believes that an effort similar to the one against Lafayette will provide a victory. ""The team looks good. W e've got to go out and be physical like we did last week,"" he said. Coach Maranzana believes that ""Columbia improved dramatically in the past two years. W e have had tough games against them in the past, and the team is hungry to get a win."" factor in determining the outcome for the rest of the season. ""We need to run tougher in the middle of the race, and I think they realize that. If we can learn from that, then that's the significant point,"" said Gulden. ""We took a rest in the middle-- sort of like what happened in the guys' race. But we don't train for now, we train for November. Now that we've learned, it's how we react."" Marsh, who placed third overall for Bucknell with a time of 18:29, said that the Lady Bison could improve upon by running together as a team. ""The coaches are geared towards getting us ready for Octo ber rather than for the first meet in September,"" commented Marsh. ""And I'd rather be running fast at Easterns than now. Every single person can contribute. The coaches have told us 'there's no dead wood on this team,' and I think that's great."" The cross-country teams do not race again until Saturday, Sept. 29, at the West Virginia Invita tional. They will face competition against many teams, including Ohio State, Kent State, Pittsburgh, and West Virginia. ""Our schedule doesn't get any easier,"" said Gulden. ""We have a major test every two weeks-- our most difficult schedule ever. We must improve every week."" Gulden singled out Pitts burgh as one of the toughest teams that the men will face in the next meet, while both Pittsburgh and W est Virginia should provide a strong challenge for the women. row's game with Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts, Rey nolds was a bit skeptical. --------- - ------------------------------------------------------------------------"

Student seating changed,"With the move of the football team to the west (pressbox) side of the field for this season, there has been some confusion as to where spectators are allowed to sit. There is not a ""home"" side of Christy Mathewson Memorial Stadium. Because we need to meet the seating needs of several groups of people, and because nearly all of these people want the prime, 50 yard line location, it is not possi ble to designate a home or visitor side. It has been my contention that Bucknell students should be given the very best seats available for watching games. This policy is unique to Bucknell. In an effort to give students the best seats pos sible, and to meet demands of alumni, friends of Bucknell, visiting team fans, and special groups, we decided that the students would most likely prefer the sections R, S, T. U, and V on the east side of the stadium. An ""informal"" poll confirmed this decision. These seats are from the 50 yard line to the goalline. However, now it seems that the cheerleaders and others have decided that everyone should sit behind the football team on the west side of the stadium. We have sold all of the reserved seats on the west side of the stadium for four of the remaining five home games. For this reason, students are encouraged to sit on the east side, as they have in the past few years, in sections at midfield designated solely for students. Should students or others admitted free with I.D. wish to sit on the west side, they will not be permitted to sit in the reserved sec tions C, D, E, F, G. The far end sections of the west side (A, B , H, J) are the only sections available for upcoming games. Ushers will be present to assist spectators. Your support of the football team and the athletic program is greatly appreciated.

administration for abuses,
Jan plan changes proposed,
Faculty to consider alternatives Monday,"By Steve Firestone The January Program, after drawing criticism for low partici pation levels, appears to be headed for major changes which would include an alteration of the present ""partially voluntary"" status of the program. The changes which may be instituted result from statistics unearthed in the March 1990 Interim Report and a subsequent recommendation by the Commit tee on Instruction (COI) to stimu late the program from several directions. The Committee on Instruc tion's attempts to amend the defi ciencies in the current program stem from what chairperson Andrea Halpem, associate professor of psy chology, termed ""severe problems"" with participation on the part of both the students and tenured faculty. Although figures from the 1990 January Program were una vailable, the 1989 figures show that 35% of Buckncil students partici pated in the program; the lowest rate was found among seniors, only 21% of whom participated. Some problems associated with student turnout have to do with availability of resources and the willingness of faculty to commit themselves to organize projects. One of the provisions of the com mittee's proposal is aimed directly at the tenured faculty. Professors, according to the proposed system, would be required to conduct Janu ary Programs once every three years. With such a radical change from the current voluntary status, several professors voiced concern See JAN PLAN, page 2 By Lisa Hirschkorn Staff Writer Students are voicing increas ing discontent over the University's enforcement of the alcohol policy. With a slumping morale, Greeks are frustrated by recent actions taken by the Office of Security and Safety as well as the administra tion. The fraternity houses are being charged amidst ""ridiculous"" searches, unreasonable demands, and delayed adjudications. Brent Edmonds '91, president of Lambda Chi Alpha, explained that his fraternity has endured two incidents that ""were fairly ridicu lous."" According to Edmonds, it was last semester during a talent show that ""security came through our house seven times in the course of three hours. You would think that after the second or third time they would realize that we were just having a talent show and noth ing was going on."" John P. Dunlop, dean of stu dents, explained that the adminis tration has no knowledge of such occurrences. ""The reports never suggested anything like that. There was never anything that I read that hints that that kind of thing has happened."" Additionally, Edmonds spoke of another incident at a party during the first week of school when ""one of the Security Officers went up to the third floor and demanded to go into a back bathroom. We told her that there was nothing going on in that bathroom and to go ahead and *rust us...that even if we wanted to we couldn't really fit anything in that bathroom, it's a private area. And she said no, 'I want to get in there and see it.' So I opened the door for her, and there was nothing in there. There was just a brother in the process of going to the bath room. She just said 'ok' and left. It didn't even phase her that it was a men's bathroom."" Mike Amarante, interim director o f security and safety, defended the officer's actions by explaining that the officer was investigating ""a public bathroom, it wasn't private so we have to check it, and we have found kegs in bath rooms before...We don't go into private areas, and it just so happens it was a female officer."" There are also reports of Security entering closed rooms. Sigma Alpha Mu president Trevor Stoyer '92 reported that two secur ity officers opened ""a few"" closed doors and entered rooms around 7 p.m. on a weekday two weeks ago. The brothers, who were upstairs in the living room, did not see security enter the premises initially but after seeing the car parked outside ""one o f the brothers came downstairs and asked them 'what are you doing?' As soon as they were con fronted the security guards said 'we're just looking around' and they left. The older officer did mention something about a new security guard but that was it."" Responding to this policy of opening doors, Dunlop said, ""I haven't heard about opening any private room doors but the rule with them is reasonable cause. You don't even try to gain access into a private room unless you have rea sonable cause to believe that a uni versity policy or regulation or state law is being violated. See G R E E K S, page 5"
Petition attacks,
university justice,"By Bob Minnich Staff Writer In response to the Office of Security and Safety's recent crack downs on social gatherings, several students have issued a petition call ing on the University to exemplify ""compassion, civility, and a sense of justice."" The students charge that these ideals, cited in Bucknell's Mission Statement, are being violated. Brent Edmonds '91, stated that about 450 signatures were col lected cm the petition this week after it had reached eight fraternities. Edmonds said he and others realize that the administration must guard themselves legally, but in doing so the administration and security are infringing on students' constitutional rights; ""We feel ... that security is infringing not only on our rights as students at Bucknell University but on our rights as citizens by invad ing our privacy,"" said Edmonds. The petition will be submit ted to President Gary Sojka and Charlotte Jacobsen Weddle, asso ciate vice president for student life, with a discussion between students and administrators. Edmonds said that an understanding between stu dents and administrators is possible only with meaningful discussion between the groups. Four grievances exist which should be addressed, according to the writers of the petition. First, Security write-ups reach fraternity presidents three or four weeks after the violation, an unreasonably long See PETITIO N , page 2"
Hazardous waste incinerator,
proposed for Union Cpunty,
BSG ban on chalk,
writing rescinded,"By Michael McGandy Staff Writer After more than an hour of vigorous debate, the Bucknell Stu dent Government overturned its previous resolution to ban writing in chalk on the University's side walks. While the BSG did decide not to act against such ""chalk- talk,"" it did pass a resolution to charge a committee with consider ing whether it should recommend criteria by which the practice of sidewalk chalking can continue at Bucknell. The elimination of chalk-talk on the grounds that it was graffiti and detracted from the aesthetic appeal of the campus had been the object of junior class representa tive Keith Eisenstein's motion that was passed on Sept 17. The motion to rescind Eisen stein's resolution passed the con gress on Sunday night in a roll call vote-- twenty one votes to ten with six abstentions. Such a motion, according to Dave Skena '91, pres ident o f the BSG, means that Eisenstein's motion or one resem bling it cannot be brought before the congress again. The other related motion which passed the congress pertain ing to chalk-talk resolved to ""assign [the] Students Affairs [committee] with the responsibility of creating criteria, if any, for chalk writing and have them bring back their criteria, if any, for BSG approval."" The rationale for the motion, according to its author, rep resentative Rick Scott '93, was to address BSG and campus concerns that ""chalk writing not get out of control."" The debate on the rectitude of banning chalk-talk was renewed by junior class representative Brian Selmeski when he put forward a motion to rescind the previous week's resolution which had passed by fourteen votes to ten with three abstentions. Selmeski, who had suggested that he might resign from the BSG if Eisenstein resolution stood, said of this Sunday's vote, ""I am pleased and impressed with the congresses' performance tonight. I pleased that I can continue to be a representative with a clear conscience."" In passing Eisenstein's motion on Sept. 17, Selmeski said that he believed that the BSG had acted too hastily on an issue that demanded serious discussion. (The reconsideration of Eisenstein's resolution had to be initiated under a motion to rescind, since according to the parliamen tary procedure by which the BSG conducts its proceedings, a motion to reconsider is only possible dur ing the meeting in which the resolu tion in question was passed. As a result, the new freshman represen tatives were able to vote on the sub- See CH ALK, page 7 By Bob Ritter Staff Writer After weeks of public specu lation, plans were officially announced last Friday for the con struction of a hazardous waste incinerator in the Susquehanna Industrial Park in Gregg Township, near the village of Allenwood. The site, in northern Union county, is approximately seven miles north of the Bucknell campus. A citizens group, the Organization United for Ecology (OUE) has formed to block the construction of the incin erator, and enjoys the support of many of Union County's elected officials. The group, headed by Clyde Peeling, local naturalist and the owner of Reptileland, held an inter est and organizational meeting on Sept. 17. A standing-room-only crowd which spilled outside the doors of the Allenwood Fire Hall was shown a videotape document ing health problems at two hazard ous waste incinerators and was urged to bring other residents into the group and to contact govern ment officials. Plans for the incinerator have been rumored since last month, when the Pennwood Construction Company, based in Philadelphia, began purchasing land for the pro posed 700 acre industrial park, located between Route 15 and the Susquehanna River. U.S. Pollution Control Inc. (USF*CI), a Houston- based subsidiary of Union Pacific Corp., announced Friday that it has purchased Pennwood's interest in the park for $6 million and will construct a hazardous waste inciner ator on the northernmost 400 acres of the site, with a total capacity of 75,000 tons of waste per year. According to a USPCI spokesman, the $100 million project is expected to generate up to 200 jobs. The company has also been negotiating with several groups to purchase railroad right-of-ways in the area, since plans call for most of the waste to be shipped to the plant in railroad cars. The company has purchased three miles of track, and is negotiating for another four- and-one-half mile section needed to link the incinerator to Conrad's Buffalo to Harrisburg line. The route would carry rail cars loaded with hazardous material through Sunbury, Milton, West Milton and New Columbia on their way to the plant. Opposition Lines Up In early September the Gregg Township supervisors passed a motion opposing the construction of the incinerator. The Union County Commissioners have also voiced opposition to the project, along with Bob Garrett, director of the Union County economic devel opment council. Garrett addressed the Sept 17 OUE meeting, raising several concerns. Garrett read a prepared statement, since he said that he had been threatened with a lawsuit by USPCI if he publicly attacked the company. Garrett said there has been a great deal o f inter est by a wide range of businesses in the industrial park, and that ""we need not accept an unwanted com pany"" at the site. Garrett is con cerned that the project ""may inspire more of the same"" kind of projects in the area, which is near Interstate 80; the highway has been dubbed ""trash alley"" because of the large volume of waste transported from See IN CIN ERA TO R, page 6 Laura Landseldel/The Bucknellian Residents packed the Allenwood Fire Hall for an organizational meet ing for the Organization United for Ecology on Sept. 18.

Petition,"From page 1 amount of time. Second, the sanc tions for alcohol violations were changed with no input from stu dents. The compromise over sanc tions between Dean Dunlop, dean of students, and the Interfratcmity Council peer review committee were disregarded during the sum mer. Third, a clear definition of probable cause needs to be written that is acceptable to Buckncll and to students, because of student complaints about Security's pow ers to search. Fourth, a channel needs to be enacted to handle com plaints about Security which would take them directly to Security The writers of the petition, Edmonds, Mark Calandra '91, Tim Amman '92, Corey Hiller '92, Bob Dawes '91, and David Holliday '91, want to involve parents and alumni by getting their signatures on the petition during Parents and Homecoming weekends. Edmonds hopes that student pressure will keep the University "" in line with what they can and cannot do regarding university pol icy and Pennsylvania law.

Jan Plan,"From page 1 that the motivation and purpose of the program would be changed. According to Steven Becker, pro fessor of physics, ""At present, stu dents in Jan Plans arc there because they choose to be; this proposal will change the tone of the January program."" He, along with Owen Floody, chair and professor of psy chology, and others, also take issue with the resulting size of classes during the term if attendance were mandatory. Floody stated, ""Assum ing minimal participation, we'U have half the student body and a third of the faculty at work during any one January, which seems to average out to about 30 students per class."" They argue that this would ruin one of the goals of the Jan Plans: intimacy with students. Halpcm answered these concerns, stating, 'There is really no change in what is expected of the faculty, but faculty are being asked to take Class of '95 would have to com plete at least one January Program as a requirement for graduation. All classes thereafter would be required to complete at least two programs which would yield a ""physical result"" (i.e. a paper, performance, or written reflection). Also important to students would be the proposed change in the length of the program. The CO l recommended that the term be cut down to approximately three weeks to combat the problems Bucknell students traditionally face in enter ing the job market later in the sum mer than students at other universi ties. To add further credibility, the Director of the January Program would be given faculty status and would oversee the functions of a new committee which would be designed to assist the director. The sweeping changes in the Jan Plan could be adopted into pol icy as early as the next faculty"

We feel that these ideals, from the University's Mission State ment, do not exemplify the University's current practices towards stu dents and their organizations.

Chi Phi boycotts,
Senior Gift Drive,"By Darren M illman Staff Writer As the Senior Gift Drive approaches the $30,000 mark, program organizers optimistically hope to make the goal of $115,000 a reality. One member of the Class of 1991, Travis Barry, is determined to do his part to ensure that the gift drive does not live up to its supporters' expectations. Barry, a member of Chi Phi Fraternity, has drafted a policy statement echoing the sentiments of the ten other members of the Chi Phi Class of 1991 (see Let ters to the Editor, page 10). This statement describes the group's intention to abstain from contrib uting towards the gift drive. The rationale behind this decision, continues the statement, is to send a message to the University that it would be nonsensical for the Chi Phi Class of 1991 to con tribute towards an institution which, according to Barry, is determined to realize ""the even tual destruction of the Greek System."" While attempting to explain the emotional motivation behind this action, Barry made it clear that it is not a personal vendetta. ""We've got nothing against the gift drive, per se,"" he stated, "" and nothing against any of the people working for [the gift drive]. We really don't have anything against the University, as such. We are simply trying to make a statement, and we feel this is a powerful way of doing that."" When asked to clarify pre cisely what the desired message the Chi Phi group would like to send to the University, Barry responded by stating that "" should the University continue with these activities so clearly aimed at the Buckncll Greek System, real hell is going to break loose, and [the University] is going to pay for it where it hurts them most."" The Chi Phi group's aspira tions clearly go beyond their per sonal boycott. It is their hope that the campus' Greek population, approximately 60% of the under graduate enrollment, will join in their effort to make a statement. Darren Shaw '91, one of the gift drive's Area Coordina tors, as well as a member of Lambda Chi Alpha Fraternity, reacted to the Chi Phi letter by explaining that while he, and oth ers working in support of the gift drive, would like to see 100% participation, they understand it is a personal decision each member of the class must make. In response to Barry's com ments regarding the University's attitude towards the Greek Sys tem, Shaw stated, "" I too am frus trated with some of the adminis tration's policies against the Greek community, but I person ally can recognize the benefits of a Buckncll education."" "" I am proud to be a member of the Greek community"" , contin ued Shaw, "" but I feel it is narrow minded to believe that being Greek is the only reason for being on the Bucknell campus."" Mike Dominguez '91, Inter fratcmity Council president, said that IFC had no plans to discuss the Chi Phi action, since IFC con siders the decision to participate in the gift drive to be purely per sonal. Samantha Gladish '91, Panhellic Council president, said that she received a copy of Barry's letter late this week, but that she knows of no similar actions planned by sorority mem bers. Gladish said that the subject "" would probably be brought up"" at Panhel's weekly meeting on Tuesday."
Student mistakenly interrogated,
by police in fake ID case,
Freshman read his rights by police at Security Office,"By Andrew Cohen Staff Writer The East Buffalo Township Police with the assistance of the Office of Security and Safety, has concluded an investigation into a misrepresentation of age case that involved the interrogation of three Bucknell freshmen. One of those interrogated, David Barry '94, was falsely accused of the offense. According to Barry, he was called by Security and ""they told me to come down... [When] I asked why they said 'I'm just a dis patcher' and they didn't even tell me."" But Barry figured that ""it was something routine"" and was not worried. According to Barry, "" when I got there, there was an East Buffalo Township [officer] with two secur ity agents."" Understandably sur prised by the situation, Barry said "" 'May I ask what's going on?' And then they [Officer Robert Huffman, Patrolman for East Buffalo Town ship Police] read me my rights."" Lewisburg District Attorney Graham Showalter explained that reading someone his or her rights is ""up to the officer to determine,"" but ""generally, it's when your in cus tody,"" that is, when ""you're restricted in where you can go."" It is unclear as to whether Barry was indeed in custody, but according to Barry, ""It phased me, but I knew that's what they had to do."" Barry explained that, after being read his rights Huffman ""handed me an ID, and he said 'that's you,' and I said no that's not. [Then he asked me] 'Where were you tonight?"" ' Barry explained that he could account for all of his hours and "" would even give proof if you want."" At this point, according to Barry, ""He [Huffman] handed the picture around to the two security agents and they said 'that might be him and that might not be him.'"" ""Then the policeman told me since it's my first offense that if I come clean now they'll go light on me,"" Barry said. However, he maintained his innocence and told Huffman, "" 'Don't even bother tell ing me that because I don't care cause I didn't do that.'"" After this Barry was let go, but told that the police would be back in touch with him ""because the investigation was still continu ing."" Although the police did catch the real offender, who was fined $350 and had his driver's license suspended for 90 days, Barry has not been informed that he is no longer a suspect "" It's been a week and they still haven't gotten in touch with me... If I didn't know [that the case had been closed] I would still be wondering if I was under suspicion."" As for Security's limited role, Mike Amarantc, interim director of Security and Safety, explained that it is standard procedure for the police to question students sus pected by the police at the Security Office, since that would be less har rowing than being taken to the police station in town. Barry noted that Security was very compassionate for the most part. "" I thought they were decent about it, but they shouldn't have let him [Huffman] do that to me."" Huffman refused to com ment on ""any aspects of the inves tigation because that's privileged information."" But he did explain the error by saying, "" He strongly resembled the guy who committed the offense."" Huffman explained that the error could have ""possibly"" occurred when the police were given the false identification by the Beer Bam. The name on the identi fication was Ted Barry. David Barry believes that the police checked under the last name "" Barry"" in the freshman directory and saw that he resembled the pic ture on the ID. The police did a license plate check on the car which was at the Beer Bam. After locating and interrogating the driver, police caught the real perpetrator, Ted Berry '94, four hours after Barry was interrogated. Ted Berry has since transferred."

The sites, numbering about six, are to the north of the Kuwaiti border. The facilities are designed to decontaminate vehicles and per sonnel, enabling Iraq to handle a large number of forces if attacked.

According to the sanctions legislation, the president may seek to modify or suspend the sanctions if four of the five conditions set by the law are met. So far the South African government has lifted the ban on democratic parties and entered negotiations with black leaders, fulfilling two conditions. The Bush administration hopes that in the next few months South Africa will meet two more condi tions: freeing all political prisoners and ending the state of emergency in Natal province. During his meeting with Con gressional leaders, de Klerk said that he wants to build an American style constitution for his nation,"

Greeks-,"From page 1 According to Charlotte Jacobsen Weddle, associate vice- president for student life, Security has both a ""monitoring role"" and ""special responsibilities"" that are ""determined by the Director of Security and Safety. Security has the responsibility to take control twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. They have the responsibility to enforce Univer sity policy, which often means tak ing extra precautions."" Other inci dents where stu dents feel that Security has over stepped its bounds were reported by Tau Kappa Epsi lon and Kappa Sigma. Mark Roessler '92, pres ident of"
TKE,"reported that Security walked into TKE during a weekend night when the house was empty and entered a closed room. ""It was a little ridiculous,"" according to Roessler, because ""there was nobody here and we didn't have a registered party. Security had no reason to be in the house...there was no cause for them to be here."" Roessler said that five men were sitting in the room and ""just hang ing out with some music playing in the background, but it was not even loud. Two security guards came in the room and said they were just 'doing a routine check'...they said 'you guys got to keep it quiet'."" According to Kurt Mull '92, a member of Kappa Sigma, Secur ity conducted spot checks when no brothers knew that they were in the house. Mull reported that on a recent Friday night at 1:30 a.m,, two security guards walked into a room and they said ""...we found 10 kegs in your walk-in and we need to see an officer now."" Mull said that they had entered the house through the back door and headed straight for their walk-in refrigera tor, located in the basement. ""The guys were not drinking and there was not a party going on...the base ment was completely dark and there was no loud music...the offi cers said they were just doing a routine check."" Greek leaders have com plained of the delays and discrepan cies between Security's so-called Dean Dunlop explained that there were seven groups who received alleged citations resulting from House Party Weekend, on May 5, and that ""everybody knew that alleged infractions had been reported and were being investi gated. The 1FC Review board was up to its navel in cases...groups were just lined up taking their turns... they couldn't have pos sibly gotten to these matters until next fall anyway."" Dunlop added ""To six of the seven groups it was clear because they did not complain."" ""If they had gone before the Peer Review Board,"" Dunlop said, ""they would have gotten the full particulars of the case of materi als."" Dunlop explained his 'compromise' as a ""bargain deal...If the IFC had deter mined the sanc tion, their previ ous record would have been taken into account and every one of those groups would have gotten more than I gave them. I kind of cut them a break due to the delay and what ever. I don't know the precise amount of Sigma Chi's violations but they would have gotten more weeks of social probation had they been found guilty...and Eric knows that because he's kept track of how many offenses Sigma Chi had."" Dunlop explained ""I was remiss in not putting this in writing as 'unfinished business.' The rea son I didn't feel much urgency to do that is because Dadez announced at the IFC meeting that we had unfinished business from House Party Weekend. Some groups had been written up, charges were pending, and they would be dealt with in the fall. And his recollection is that he told the groups who they were."" Belcher also voiced concern about an alleged violation during the Freshman Orientation period which the administration followed up with an automatic probation without trial. Sigma Chi, along with seven other fraternities, received letters from Jacobsen warning them against ""Any further violations..."" Jacobsen explained that the letters were not a ""you have been found guilty"" charge but they were an ""interim suspension 'extra precautions' and the adminis tration's policy. According to Pete Troost '91, president of Sigma Phi Epsilon, ""Security does things, and tells you why they did them later, just like spot checks. Security tells you to keep the band down and they'll come back in twenty min utes. Then you get a letter in your mailbox three weeks later busting Colin Bridgewater/The Bucknellian Mike Amarante has assumed the job of Interim Director of the Department of Security and Safety for the third time in his stay at Bucknell. you for the first time they came."" Sigma Chi President Eric Belcher '91 reported that his house did not receive the report of alleged violations from last May until the first week of September. In a letter addressed to President Sojka, Belcher said ""for the first time, I have seen no security report outlin ing the details of the alleged viola tion."" Belcher explained ""Dean Dunlop gave us the 'choice' of tak ing an automatic three weeks of social probation or scheduling a hearing with the IFC Peer Review Board to decide the matter. Dean Dunlop informed me that if we opted to have our case heard, and we were found guilty, that we would be facing a more severe pen alty. As the alleged violation occurred in May, it was impossible for me to find anyone who remem bered the events of the evening. Twenty-four members of our frater nity have since graduated, and I was not prepared to track them all down in order to see if they might be of some assistance in the mat ter...our Fraternity was forced to opt for the Dean's 'compromise'."" ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>"
Enforcement of alcohol sanctions,
found to be tougher on Greeks,"News Analysis By Andrew Cohen and Brian Davison Staff Writers ""Students have been telling me ... that there is a difference between the way Residential Life investigates [alcohol violations] and Security does,"" said John P. Dunlop, dean of students, in an interview this week. According to Mike Amarante, interim direc tor of security and safety, Secur ity was given the responsibility for monitoring fraternities at a meeting ""of the Deans and Tim Murrell."" Because residential life has retained monitoring responsi bilities in residence halls, frater nities are treated differently than students living in residence halls when it comes to alcohol viola tions. Recent incidents seem to reveal a pattern of uneven enforcement of the University Alcohol Policy. According to Kevin O'Brien, vice-president of Chi Phi fraternity, on Sept 8, one Chi Phi brother and two other stu dents were caught with cups of beer in the fraternity house. After a search of the common areas of the house, a tapped keg was found in the house's refrigerator. According to O'Brien there were few other brothers in the house, but the house was subsequently charged with a group violation of the Alcohol Policy. On Aug. 28, according to Dunlop, eleven underage stu dents were caught drinking by Gerard Turbide, downhill area coordinator, in Carey House, which is part of the Social Justice College. Several others left when they saw Turbide. Upon further investigation a tapped keg was found in the bathroom. Charges are pending against the individuals who were caught, but no group charges against either Carey House or the Social Justice College are pending, according to Dunlop. Dunlop explained that the reason for filing individual charges as opposed to group charges was that ""the residential life staff mem bers that investigated that did not report anything that suggested that the event was at the initiation of or under the sponsorship of the Social Justice College. Furthermore, it was the first night of orientation, all of the students were freshmen, and not all of the students cited came from Carey house or the Social Jus tice College."" According to Dunlop, Tur bide investigated the situation thor oughly before coming to this con clusion. Dunlop explained that the determination of group or individ ual charges in the case of tapped kegs is based on ""how many people were involved, who purchased the keg, and where it was."" Many Greeks would argue that if the same situation that devel oped in Carey House, i.e. a tapped keg in a common area, had hap pened in a fraternity, that the house would face group charges. The dif ference, however, was that Resi dential Life made an effort to ascer tain whether or not it was a group violation. 'Those groups and/or organi zations who hold functions/ activities on University owned or controlled property, with alcohol involved, are required to follow the guidelines and policies set forth by the Bucknell University Act 31 Task Force [University Alcohol Policy Relating to Stu dents and Students Organiza tions, Revised 6/90],"" according to a pamphlet sent recently to all members of the Bucknell com munity from President Gary Sojka. The University Alcohol Policy states that for fraternities, ""alcoholic beverages cannot be present in public areas of chapter houses except at approved, regis tered events and in approved quantities."" The policy for resi dence halls is similar, saying that ""alcoholic beverages may not be present in common areas of resi dence halls, except during regis tered events approved by the Office of Residential Life."" In each of the incidents, all students were individually cited for underage drinking while in the Chi Phi incident, the frater nity was additionally charged with holding an unregistered party and related offenses. Student concern centers around the fact that when frater nities are found with tapped kegs in common areas they are auto matically charged with group vio lations even if there is just one brother involved. Although he denied this as a prima facie prac tice, he did note, ""I don't recall a case in which a keg was found in a house in a common area that charges were not filed against the house."" (Next week the oversight of Security will be investigated.) saying until this is adjudicated don't do things that are likely to exacerbate"" existing problems. According to Jacobsen, the ""'interim suspension' is a pending adjudication"" and there are ""differ ent strategies"" behind the sanctions and the suspensions. Dunlop further explained the 'interim suspension' as ""a putting things on hold so you don't make matters worse. It looked like they had done something wrong...it was a warning saying don't complicate things by business as usual or something. It looks like a punish ment because they've stopped dead in their tracks but it's a protective 'stop dead in your tracks' rather than a sanction or punishment."" Kappa Sigma, another one of the seven houses to receive an ""interim suspension"" letter from Jacobsen, waited two weeks until their case was adjudicated and received an explicit warning for the ""thirty-five to forty freshmen present"" when Associate Dean Mary Dorsey entered their house. According to Greg Geissenberger '92, a brother of Kappa Sigma, ""Mary Dorsey saw a bunch of freshmen go by SAE, go by Sammy, and then walk into Kappa Sig. Then she came in the house and needed to talk to an officer because we had allowed freshmen into the house before we were allowed."" Geissenberger said that the brothers did not know if they were freshmen and there was not a brother standing at the door ""check ing everyone's i.d. to find out if they were."" ""Although Freshmen were more than 50% of the problem,"" Dorsey said, ""It is the responsibility of the fraternity to ensure freshmen are not in the houses...it's a tough problem."" Dorsey explained that on the first night that two houses were allegedly charged with having freshmen, she went around and ""asked for an officer"" at each of the fraternities. Dorsey said ""I reminded them of the policy they had received earlier that week.."" In response to Kappa Sigma's difficulty in identifying freshmen, Dorsey said ""I would assume that if you saw a group of thirty to forty people, you would ask them who they were and what they were doing."" Dorsey explained that while driving by in her car, ""I watched the same group walking down Seventh Street and stopping at a couple of places"" but the only house they entered was Kappa Sigma. Dorsey said ""By the time I went around the block and parked my car, they still had not come out."" Dorsey explained ""the freshmen have a responsibility too but that it is difficult, by myself, to get the names and i.d.'s of a group of thirty people."" According to Dorsey there has been a least one freshmen who came out of a frater nity charged with underage drinking."

Incinerator,"The Bucknellian September 28/ 1990 From page 1 New Jersey to Pennsylvania dispo sal sites near the highway. Garrett noted that the township ""has paid its dues with negative develop ments"" such as the Allenwood Fed eral Prison Camp and the Lycom ing County Landfill, and said the incinerator project may adversely affect a proposal to expand the prison. Garrett is concerned about the general health risks of the pro ject, as well as the specific danger that a derailment may cause a haz ardous waste spill into the Susque hanna River. Garrett said that the incinerator could affect the Univer sity because Lewisburg ""is down wind and down river"" from the site, and because the danger that other businesses, such as chemical and pharmaceutical companies, may be attracted to the area, possibly endangering ""the pristine nature of the county."" Union County State Rep. Russ Fairchild has also gone on record against the project, question ing the ability of the state Depart ment of Environmental Resources to monitor safety at the site, saying that, ""The question is how good is DER at actually monitoring a facil ity on a daily basis? Fiscally I frankly don't see any more money coming to enhance monitoring capabilities for any government agency."" Fairchild has also ques tioned the location of the incinera tor in rural Union County, since over 80 percent of Pennsylvania's hazardous waste is generated in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. Professor advocates incineration Michael LaGrcga, professor of civil engineering, is a former director of hazardous waste plan ning for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. LaGrega, who was responsi ble for overseeing the implementa tion of Pennsylvania's 1986 plan for thermal disposal, is an expert on hazardous waste disposal and an advocate for incineration. He feels ""state-of-the art incinerators are safe. The risks are much lower"" than with other disposal methods, such as storage or burial, ""but that's not to say they are risk-free."" LaGrega feels that ""there is clearly a need for these types of disposal, [since] there is no alternative for organic [hazardous] waste."" The two main dangers for harmful emis sions from incineration, according to LaGrega, lie in changes in the feedstream into the burner, and in poor operation of the facility. While there is a danger that toxic materials such as cadmium, nickel, mercury and dioxins may be released in air emissions, LaGrega explained that most harmful emis sions are released if waste is burned at an improper temperature, but that modem incinerators ""have very elaborate control systems [and] the feedstream shuts off if the tempera ture drops"" below an acceptable level. He also noted that ""there are rather stringent air toxin regula- tions"" regarding emissions. Whether an incinerator only accepts the types of wastes for which it is designed, LaGrega said, ""is a function of how good the management plan is, and how good the company is, [since] the only way you can get assurances is if the management at the top will see you get proper controls."" He explained that USPCI is ""not a new com pany"" and ""has a reputation for being responsible"" at similar facili ties the company operates. LaGrega noted that with a large, established company such as Union Pacific, there is little danger the company will go bankrupt and disappear, leaving an abandoned, contami nated site. Campus opinion split on issue Unlike LaGrega, some stu dents and faculty members oppose construction of the Gregg Town ship incinerator. Bucknell's Earth Action group will be attempting to recruit members for OUE on cam pus in the coming weeks. Accord ing to Matt Cohn '93, one of the organizers of the effort. Earth Action will be setting up tables in the Langone Center mall to solicit members of the campus community to join OUE and to sign petitions against the construction of the incinerator. Ben Marsh, chair and asso ciate professor of geography, con cedes that ""[hazardous waste] exists, and you have to put it some where, and incineration, in some ways is greatly preferable"" to other methods of disposal. However, Marsh questioned the safety of incineration in a number of areas, chiefly ""serious health concerns, which are not the same as serious health problems."" The difficulty, he said, is that the relatively low levels of toxins involved make the long term effects hard to measure, and ""since the data is unclear, people can interpret it either way."" Marsh also noted that while new incinera tors incorporate state-of-the-art technology designed to maximize safety, ""to say that the design of the plant is adequate is not the same as saying that the implementation will be adequate, or perfect...The design can be adequate and the operation isn't, [since] the exis tence of technology isn't the same as trusting"" the operators. Marsh pointed to the Peach Bottom nuclear plant in southern Pennsyl vania, in which control room opera tors were found to be sleeping on the job, as an example of the dan gers inherent despite the presence of safety systems. Marsh also addressed the ""equity issue"" involved, since ""[an incinerator] ends up somewhere, in somebody's neighborhood."" Marsh believes the decision was made to locate the project in Union County because ""central Pennsylvania has such agreeable people, who tend not to be political or activist. They tend to trust the government and corporations."""
Dinner held for committee of a thousand,"Colin Bridgewater/The Bucknellian Robert Rooke '13 was present this Saturday for a dinner that was held for the major contributors to the Campaign for Bucknell. Rooke, who has a tradition of giving to the University, dedicated Rooke Chapel to his parents in 1964. Bucknell raised over $90 million from 1983 to 1990 through the Campaign. The money is being used for, among other things, physical improvements to the campus, such as the new Sci ence Complex. By Andrew Cohen and Steve Hoerter Staff Writers September 21-23 was desig nated as the ""Weekend of a Thou sand."" Those people who have- made major contributions to the Campaign for Bucknell, which took place from 1983 to 1990, were on hand to celebrate the most successful fundraising drive in the history of the University. The theme for the weekend was ""Ninety in Ninety."" The week end was in celebration of the $90.9 million that was raised during the Campaign for Bucknell. The dinner was attended by several members of the Board of Trustees, among them, Chairman Lee Idleman who spoke to the guests and stressed the importance of fundraising to function of the university. Robert L. Rooke '13, secretary emiritus of the Baord of Trustees, was also in attendance. Alumni ranging the spectrum of age were there to show their support for the University. Bucknell enters the new dec ade in a much firmer financial posi tion, allowing for, among other things, new facilities, scholarships and faculty chairs.

Chalk,"From page 1 stance of Eisenstein's resolution within the context of the motion to rescind.) ""I feel the BSG should not take any stance on chalk-talk until we have a better understanding of federal and municipal laws on this issue,"" Selmeski stated to the con gress. ""We are acting without a great deal of foresight."" This appeal to first amend ment concerns was challenged by John Dunlop, dean of students, who stated that he believed that the Uni versity's private status meant that it had the right to limit the form of expression if it saw fit ""This clearly is a property issue,"" Dunlop said clarifying com ments he made to The Bucknellian last week. 'The University owns the sidewalks and to write on them is a privilege given to you, not by the Constitution, but by us."" Eisenstein, in defending the resolution he authored, supported Dunlop's reading of the issue as one of property rights and not first amendment rights. By attempting to ban chalk-talk, Eisenstein said that he was not trying to limit speech, but to protect the appear ance of the campus which which the community shares. ""If this motion to rescind passes we lose control of our prop erty,"" Eisenstein stated. 'This chalking is detracting from the campus; one of the reasons I came to this campus is because it was one of the nicest in the Northeast."" Selmeski addressed the issue of property rights, stating that ""by rescinding this resolution we are actually retaining control of our property."" Such a resolution, he went on to argue, set a precedent for limiting student expression and predetermining how students may interact with their campus environment. Alternate representative Jeff Mastracchio '91, warned the con gress that it should not let the con cern for aesthetics override the importance of conveying ideas and information. He also questioned whether or not people were voting on the form of expression, as Eisen- stein's resolution states, or on its content. Chalk-talk has become an increasingly popular method for organizations to present their politi cal messages or advertise campus events which they sponsor. While the practice was originally begun by the service fraternity Alpha Phi Omega, the organization whose writing has drawn the most atten tion has been the Partnership of Women Engaged in Revolution (P.O.W.E.R.) which uses the chalk writing to address gender issues and the status of relations between the sexes. Arguing for the rescission of the resolution to ban chalk-talk, representative Tony Graves '93 drew an analogy between construc tion projects on campus and the chalking of the sidewalk by groups such as P.O.W.E.R. Though some might find the actual construction of these new buildings unsightly, he said, everyone is pleased with and convinced of the value of the completed structure. The chalking which some consider to be aesthetically offen sive can be approached in the same manner. What chalk-talk is doing, Graves said, ""is building your mind. You want new ideas, this is the way to get them."" Eisenstein's point that ban ning chalk-talk would not have the effect of limiting speech due to the availability of other mediums of communication was supported by Carl Zeckerberg '91, a class repre- m i <4 m m S* y * M s m r .r * g im S Wm T. #E S"

\i,
it,"By Lisa Lipari Did you ever wonder where all that mail from Bucknell comes from? Who writes all those letters? Who stuffs the envelopes? Well, the answers lie in Cooley Hall. The heart of the University's contacts with the outside world, Cooley Hall is the location of Buckncll's Public Relations, Publi cations and Development offices. It is here that detailed files are kept on all alumni since the first gradu ating class, and where the planning for most major events at Bucknell occurs. The University Relations office handles everything from organizing reunions and theme weekends for alumni to sending out mailings for prospectives. Accord ing to Marsha Scott Gori, Editor of Bucknell World, the main objec tive of the University Relations office is ""keeping track of people,"" which is why a professional clip ping service is used to find out any noteworthy information about Bucknell graduates. The articles are saved and kept with the person's records at Cooley Hall. Letters of congratulations are sent out for weddings, birth announcements, promotions, and special occasions in the lives of Bucknellians. The Development Depart ment also includes the Annual and Deferred Giving offices, which deal mainly with fund raising. Large sums of money are given to Bucknell by alumni, parents and friends and the Giving offices are instrumental in maintaining corre spondence with these benefactors. Special days, such as Scholarship Day, are organized so that these benefactors can see exactly what their gifts have done for the Buck nell students who have received them."

Colin Bridgewater/The Bucknellian Slip Slidin'Away! Alec Altman '94 enjoys a nighttime splash in a water slide erected behind Vedder Hall. The publications office, located on the second floor of Cooley Hall, is primarily involved in media and public relations. Bucknell World, whose readership includes alumni, parents, faculty, administration, staff, seniors, friends, corporations and founda tions, and others, contains informa tion about Bucknellians and ""Class Notes,"" a section which contains stories, anecdotes, and tidbits writ ten by former Bucknellians. According to Gori, ""We're one of the last places you can get pub lished"" because Bucknell World publishes many articles submitted by alumni. Gori said that while the department has greatly expanded, they have done so conservatively and have been able to maintain a steady level of production. ""The amount of work that comes out [of this office] is unbe lievable. We have a large support staff who are the foot soldiers.Jt has always been a tradition to have professional and support staffs working together,"" said Gori. But Cooley Hall was not always the center for Bucknell's outside correspondence. Built circa 1880 and later named for Robert L. Cooley '36, trustee and Alumni Representative, the hall was origi nally used by Bucknell as a frater nity house for Theta Upsilon Omega (1928-1938), which was later called Sigma Phi Epsilon. The fraternity was disbanded after WWII and the house was given back to its previous owner until the University purchased it in 1943. After that it was used as a men's dining hall, the University Cafete ria, boarding facilities for upper classmen, as office space for the Central Susquehanna Intermediate Unit, and, finally, as the headquar ters for University and Public Relations. Because it is located away from the center of campus (on the comer of Malcolm street and Uni versity avenue), some who work at Cooley feel that they are isolated. Gori said that they sometimes feel like a separate entity, but that they all stick together. ""It's better that we're here...we're easy to find...and alumni come here to the 'external relations triangle.' That is, the Alumni House, the President's House and Cooley Hall."" She added, ""Even though we're located off campus we feel like we're a part of everybody."""
Dear Wanda,"Dear Wanda, It's only the third week of classes and already I'm stressed out! At this rate I'll never make it through the semester. Do you have any suggestions? Dear Stressed, Don't worry. We all feel this way sometimes. Stress can work to your advantage if you know how to handle it the right way. Emotion ally, stress leads to moodiness, sleeplessness, and lack of concen tration. Physically, stress leads to upset stomach, headaches, skin rashes, and insomnia. Here are some helpful tips: EAT WELL: i.e. fruits, vege tables, and fiber. Avoid that candy bar; fatigue will follow the original sugar high. SLEEP: don't skimp on your zzzzz's and make sure you avoid those stressful thoughts before bedtime. EXERCISE: take a walk, do aerobics, lift weights, swim... Bucknell has an amazing variety of exercise options."

YOUR,"FEELINGS: talk to your friends or give Psych Services a call. They are located in Lowry House and are always eager to help. The phone number there is 523-1604. Many students use this resource so there's no need to feel any embarrassment. Most of all, give yourself a break! Don't set goals that are too difficult--most pressure comes from within. Dear Wanda, My roomate brought some one home last weekend and they hooked up while I was in the room. I pretended to be asleep because"
I,"was embarrassed. What should I do if it happens again? Dear Unwilling Voyeur, If you have a good relation ship with your ro nmate, a polite request from you should solve the problem before it can happpen again. Simply tell your roomy that you are delighted they are having a good time, but you are a light sleeper. Suggest that you would be happy to stay in a friend's room if you were forewarned. Make sure you do not sound accusing or hos tile; starting with ""I felt embar rassed"" or something similar will keep your roomy off the defensive. If you do not have a good rapport with your roommate, ruin ing the mood might do the trick. Next time he or she attempts to sneak in with a hook-up, ""wake up"" loudly; explain you want a drink of water and say, ""do not let me dis turb you"" on your way out. Try not to sound TOO hostile or sarcastic; they may decide to stick around just to spite you. If the ""friend"" is still there upon your return (give them a few minutes to say good bye), tell them you are going to read for a while and explain that they should just pretend you are not there. If this does not affect the happy couple, suggest that since they are not overly concerned with privacy, perhaps the hall lounge would be more appropriate. Trade offs can work as well--for exam ple, promising not to tell anyone about her padded bras if she prom ises not to hook-up in your presence. Send your problems to: Dear Wanda, do The Bucknel lian, Box C-3059. Editor's note: ""Dear Wanda"" will be a regular column in this section of The Bucknellian. 1 DENTIST 1"

Let's Do Lunch,
Bucknell Golf Club,"Smoketown Rd. Hours: Starting Oct. 1 Closed Mondays 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday through Sunday With Steve Hoerter and Julie Bachman Staff Writers One of the best kept secrets in town has to be the new dining facility at the Bucknell Golf Club. It's not a ""members only"" situa- tion...so if you are a student, faculty member, or Lewisburg resident you are automatically eligible to wine, dine, and (whatever else you want to do) in this stylish establishment surrounded by the breath taking rolling links of the B.G.C. Last year a significant number of dollars were allocated to the refurbishment of the old country club building. A dining room and snack bar were part of the plan...and it turned out very nicely. Numerous tables have pleasant scenic views of the out-of-doors, or, if you are in a sporting mood, you can catch the ""game"" on the tele vision. (It would be an ideal place to catch the Bears' game on a Sunday afternoon.) Steve and Julie were in a state of flux, so they watched the tube and, for a bit of entertainment, watched some ""golfers"" go 8 over par on the 10th hole. Julie decided to sample the chicken salad platter ($2.75) and an order of french fries ($1.00). Neither was particularly spectacu lar, but the presentation was impressive. The chicken salad was served on a bed of lettuce and cabbage with carrots, celery and tomatoes. Carr's Table Water Crackers also accompanied the meal. The chicken salad may have been a bit more tasty...there really was no unique taste. The french fries were average- again, there was nothing appreciatively superb about them. (Julie suspects that the chicken salad may be the same that is served in the cafeteria.) Steve dined on a turkey club ($2.85) and an order of fries. He thought the club was excellent and filling. He felt that the fries were ""better than McDonald's but not better than Wendy's."" (Steve is on a health kick and really appreciates Wendy's use of vegetable oil instead of beef tallow.) The prices at the Bucknell Golf Club are irresistably low. The helpings were very generous and the service was distinguished. The B.G.C. serves breakfast on the weekends only. Lunch* and dinner are served daily and a large assortment of items are avail able...from salads, burgers, and sandwiches to buffalo wings and soups. Steve and Julie are in a great mood this time...unlike last week we did not require the use of antacids to get through the day. On a scale of one to five bison (one being the lowest and most humiliat ing number possible) we rate the Bucknell Golf Club three bison."

Bison Tales,"By Peter Lalos and Marc Haimes The other day I was head ing to an afternoon lecture, just watching the campus construc tion workers race each other to the Porta-John, and, you know, there's something about psychol ogy class that really scares me. ... Hold it Let's get this cafeteria business out of the way first Somebody cue me. WHAM! SPLATTO! So before I knew what happened, I'm sporting this joker's chicken fajita on my shirt. He mumbles something like, ""I hope they let me get a second entree anyway,"" and walks back to the serving line. Meanwhile, the entire caf has erupted into joyous applause-- it's a form of relieving stress for them, I know, but I need it like a third nostril. Well, at least I found my friends-- they're the ones holding up the scorecards. 9.7, 8.6,9.2, 10.0,9.8... I've had better wipeouts. I sit down with them, and immediately everyone starts busting on what I'm eating. Have you ever sat down at a table where everyone actually liked what you were eating? I just can't see this scene: ""Man, that looks absolutely scrump tious... Hey fellas, look at this spread! Damn, gimme some of that!!!"" It's not meant to happen. But I digress. Anyway, my entree-splattered shirt is begin ning to look like a Van Gogh painting by now, and my turn coat buddies are still blistering me for my decision to go with the raw carrot lasagna. I was pretty fed up with the whole affair, so I got up to cool off my nerves at the soda dispenser. Bad call. The Cherry Coke machine had a familiar sign on it: Sorry. Out of order. I couldn't help but thinking that this situation would make for an intriguing psychol ogy dissertation... Are they hon estly feeling remorse since they've run out of this drink, or is it more a sense of embarrassed inadequacy? Let's get down to brass tacks, here. Like a dingbat, then, I tried the Sprite dispenser (it was the only one without a yellow card). It spat out a clear froth of carbonated water, along with a sound reminiscent of a cat spew ing up one mother of a hairball. Why is it that an inexplicable sense of shame comes over you when this happens? Why don't they simply stamp ""Rejected!"" on my forehead while they're at it? At once I noticed that people were starting to gather and mur mur amongst themselves. These soda machines always make me feel so neurotic. Back outside, I found my friends scoping like madmen while they ate. A time honored tradition; nothing new here. As I watched them work out, though, the practicality of this situation bothered me. After all, how hot can people look while they're snarfing down a stromboli? Besides, it's been clinically proven that 63% of all caf acci dents occur due to excessive scoping. Perhaps if that dingle- berry at the salad bar hadn't been on the lookout for a one- nighter... Ah, but this is mere conjecture. It was at this point that I noticed something going on with my buddies that is common to all hard-core scammers-- and that is, the longer a person scams, the harder he chews what's in his mouth. In fact, after awhile they begin to down right grind it to death. It's for this reason that I recommend the cafeteria's roast beef to these people. Fascinating, this classic inner struggle of the scoper: ID: Man, is dis caf scope heaven 'er what? EGO: Hold thy tongue, knave. Verily, this is a hall of nourishment, and little else. ID: Hey, some people might even argue wid' dat... Whoa, senorita! Make my night! EGO: Forsooth, thou art an embarrassment to thine gender. Abstain, saycth I, Abstain! ID: Aw, gimme some slack, you quiche. 'An loosen up yer chassis belt, while yer at it! EGO: That would be ""chastity belt."" ID: Whatever. Man, dig them carouselambras!!! EGO: Yeesh. I suddenly snapped out of my reverie as I noticed that the other guys were stuffing a magi cal pot pourri of raw egg, oat meal and chicken burgers into one of my glasses. I'm not cer tain why people do this-- maybe it has something to do with an unresolved Oedipal complex. At the very least, it usually signals the end of the meal. One of the guys stood up, and the rest of us hastily fol lowed suit (Apparently, it's one of man's greatest fears to be left behind at a cafeteria table). This is what's known as the clash between autonomy and self doubt. Over at the tray line, we got yelled at because we didn't take the paper products off of our plates. Anyway, it was at this juncture that I faced a famil iar problem. I think we all know what I'm referring to: The dilemma of trying to retain some modicum of dignity and poise while the caf workers look at what atrocities you've com mitted on your tray. Somehow when you receive the worker's pained expression, the aesthetic value of your pudding sculture of 'The Thinker"" doesn't seem so appealing anymore. Pulling our collars up around our faces, the five of us beat a hasty retreat out of the cafeteria, taking two steps at a time down the stairwell. ... Well, there you have it. Now, as I trudge off to psychol ogy class with about 17 books under one arm (I'm not secure enough in my masculinity to use two hands), I thrust my free hand into my empty right pocket. I find myself reflecting on my irrational fear of meal cards, and shudder. The insensi tivity of it all--the sum of human worth reduced to nothing more than a thin piece of coded plastic... speaking of which, where the hell is my ID? Thunderheads roll onto the horizon, the bells of Rooke Chapel ring ominously, and, somewhere off in the distance, Pavlov's dog is drooling up a storm."

"Hendricks talks about Bucknell, his job, a n d  his interests","By Sean Grass Staff Writer Lewis Hendricks, Jr. That's a name that all Bucknell students should know, though probably less than ten people on campus have any idea who he is. Even so, Lewis Hendricks, Jr. is very much aware of the students of Bucknell Univer sity. Part of his job is ensuring the safety and well-being of all of us here at Bucknell. At the same time he must satisfy the citizens of the community surrounding the cam pus. Striking that sometimes pre carious balance is what the mayor of Lewisburg must do, and Lewis Hendricks, Jr. always strives for that compromise. ""I'm elected by the people of Lewisburg, and I still want to pro tect the safety of Bucknell students here. So I'm an in-between guy,"" he tells me from the comfort of a recliner in his living room. ""I try to work for everybody. That's my job."" So the mayor must straddle the tense line that is the relationship between the Bucknell students and the Lewisburg residents. The ten sion between students and residents is essentially never-ending, as the mayor admits. Hendricks says the problem has always been particu larly acute in the 6th St., 7th St, and 8th S t areas, where the greatest concentration of student apartments is located. Complaints of noise, dis orderly conduct, and the like are common in these areas. A smile draws across his face and he says, ""The kids can have as many parties as they want, so long as it is under control."" The mayor realizes that parties and some wild behavior are to be expected, and as long as there are no complaints from neighbors and no public dis plays of drunkenness or rowdy behavior, there is normally no problem. Simple respect for the rules and regula tions of Lewis burg is the key. Says Hendricks, ""You're going to live by the bor ough ordinances, and that's the way it's going to be."" According to the mayor, the relationship between the town and the university has indeed improved in recent years. Several years ago the students of Bucknell were, as Hendricks puts it, ""a real pain in the neck."" Although the students spent a great deal of money in the shops of Lewisburg, that benefit was outweighed by the trouble they would cause roaming the city streets. Now that story is changing. The mayor says that the addition of the Weis Center, as well as various university-sponsored programs, has provided an attraction for students to spend their time on campus. This is one explanation for the improve ment in relations. Other factors have also played a vital role. For instance, residents of 6th St. hold neighbor hood gatherings so that the students living there can acquaint them selves with their neighbors. Also, borough officials have begun to meet with representatives of the Bucknell Student Government to provide an opportunity for an airing out of problems in the university- borough relationship and to discuss possible solutions. But the key to the improve ment in relations has been the great rapport between Lewisburg offi cials and Bucknell's administration. Each quarter, Hendricks tells me, he and other borough officials meet with President Gary Sojka and a team of university administrators in what they call a ""get-together."" The groups discuss problems, policy changes, and policy alternatives. Each side tries to keep the other informed about the problems that face it. Staying abreast of the prob lems is crucial. Overall, Hendricks says, ""The town and the university administration do have a good working relationship."" He empha sizes that this is particularly true since Gary Sojka took over as pres ident of the university. With Sojka, Hendricks says, there has been ""a big difference -- an improvement in working rela tions."" He also lauds outgoing Director of Security and Safety Timothy Murrell as an excellent man to work with, and he has a note of sincerity in his voice when he says that Murrell will be missed. Of course, Hendricks has no qualms about saying that the whole administration has been very good to work with. Right now, Hendricks says that the relationship between Bucknell's administration and the borough government ""is at a ten."" The mayor does admit to some concerns about the effects of the university's new and more stringent alcohol policy for this year. He believes that the new pol icy ""probably will"" make things worse as parties are moved off campus and into Lewisburg as a result of the tougher alcohol regula tions. Borough police may just have to crack down harder. Hen dricks says, ""In the past, we used to give warnings"" to some offenders, but that this year there will be ""no more warnings. The police hate to be babysitters."" Yet he is quick to add that the bor ough will do whatever is nec essary to main tain good living conditions in Lewisburg. Incidents of public drunkenness and improper behav ior--such as an incident three weeks ago in which a Bucknell stu dent was found passed out at 2:30 a.m. on the curb of St. John St.-- merely leave ""a bad taste not only for the Bucknell people but for the community."" But, generally speaking, Hen dricks states, 'The borough as a whole has accepted Bucknell."" That seems to suit him just fine. Now into his twenty-first year in Lewisburg politics, including eight years on borough council (of which five were spent as council presi dent) and twelve years plus as mayor, Lewis Hendricks, Jr. would prefer to have as little friction as possible between residents and stu dents. Recently retired, Lewis (friends call him ""Lew"" for short) would like to spend as much time as possible at home enjoying the company of his wife and pets. His four little dogs, all of them differ ent breeds, are ...rambunctious, to say the least. Lew says they're just like kids. His parrot, Chico, never stops talking and squawking, and he can even whistle the Star- Spangled Banner when he has a mind. In addition, a few aquariums of tropical fish sit in his living room, one of them serving as the middle portion of his glass coffee table. Yes, there is plenty to keep him occupied at home; even so, he has his late nights. His wife Jeanne peeks around the comer from the kitchen to ask, ""Did he tell you that sometimes he doesn't get home 'til midnight?"" Yes, he did. Lew tells me that his average work week is about fifteen hours for his mayoral duties. Only one or two of those hours is spent in the office. The rest of the time is taken up by meetings, groundbreak ing ceremonies, and responding to phone calls from residents with problems. He says they are prob lems that at times border on... ""Ludicrous,"" I offer. He agrees with a smile, but he insists that to the person with the problem, the problem is as impor tant as if ""a truck came through my yard and knocked down my front porch."" The mayor was bom in Lewisburg, but moved with his par ents to Milton where he attended school. He moved back to Lewis burg with his wife in 1952. Now he lives with his wife, his dogs, his parrot, and his fish. The mayor has a daughter who lives away from home, but a picture of her sits on the shelf behind his chair. With so many things in one house, the home is transformed into a show- place. There truly is something interesting to look at in every cor ner as you are serenaded by Chico, who loves country music. And in the midst of it all, Mayor Lewis Hendricks, Jr. sits at ease in his armchair and shoots the breeze with me. ""I just try to be a friendly person. I try to work for every body."" After a moment he adds, ""If a Bucknell student has a problem and they need to talk to me, my phone number is in the book. I know you don't vote me in, but you're still part of the community."" That seems to be a great asset to the Bucknell student body, so I ask him how long he plans on being mayor, and he says his term is up in Novem ber of 1993. Will he run again? ""No way!"" he laughs, ""no way!"" ""Can"
I,"quote you on that?"" I kid him. He says ""yes,"" but his wife chimes in ""no"" from the kitchen. So I guess it's hard to say. But either way, Lewis Hendricks, Jr. will remain what he is, a man who just likes people and who wants to do the best he can for people in every way."

and I still want to protect the safety,
"of Bucknell students here.""","Ashley Chertkof/The Bucknellian Lewis Hendricks relaxes in his living room as he talks about life since his recent retirement, allowing him to concentrate more on his mayo ral duties."

Bucknellian,"September 28, 1990"
It ain't broke; don't fix it,
January at Bucknell is quiet and peaceful. The setting is in fact bucolic. Few,
"students grace the halls and pathways, while professors work to prepare materi",
"als for the coming semester and delve into deeper, research-intensive studies in",
their fields.,
The Committee on Instruction (COI) wants to change this setting. Citing the,
"Middle States Accreditation mid-term review as a basis, COI has presented a set",
of recommendations to the faculty hoping in earnest that something will change.,
They want to see a Bucknell student body that is,
required,
to participate in a pro,
gram that was designed to be voluntary and self-enrichment oriented. And they,
want to see a faculty that is already overworked and overloaded forced to offer,
programs for unmotivated and uninterested students. Who has COI been talking,
"to? Certainly not the students, and very likely not our faculty.",
"""Does the January program need to be fixed?,"" COI queries. Phone calls and",
letters from parents are cited --  made out to number in the hundreds. COI tells,
"us that these letters remind us ""that the role of January in the Bucknell education",
"is not clear to those beyond campus."" Furthermore, they assert, ""The expense of",
"an unproductive January -- in student time, in housing fees, and in postpone",
"ment of the start of summer --  seems not to be justified to parents and students.""",
According to whom?,
Both students and faculty take advantage of the current January Plan system.,
"This time is used by students for self-enrichment, both on- and off-campus,",
travel and as an opportunity to help finance the exorbinant costs of a Bucknell,
education. Untenured and tenured faculty alike use this time for research and to,
prepare materials for classes to be held in the Spring.,
By what standards is the COI judging whether student time is productive or,
not during January and if our January Plan has been justified? When did COI,
hold open meetings and forums to solicit student opinion and when was the stu,
dent body notified of these pending recommendations?,
Bucknell University exists to fulfill the needs and wants of its student body.,
Students clearly enjoy the opportunities and freedoms of the current January plan,
-- and faculty needs and deserves this time for research and to prepare for spring,
classes.,
What then is the issue?,

BSG member speaks out,"To the Editor: I have heard it many times before, ""What does BSG do any way?"" Students, too concerned with books or booze, time and time again have simply written off the true value of their student government Attempting to avoid hypocrisy, I must admit that I also have asked that question at various times during my stay here. My main reason has been that I believed that any real lib eral changes that BSG proposes, to assist with the dragging of the univer- sity out of the political stone age in which it now flounders, would either be drastically modified or ignored so that it would fit comfortably within the moderate to neocon servative school policy that the administration so dutifully enforces. However, my hypothe sis was dependent on the assump tion that the Bucknell Student Government was for liberal progress, which I now see was simply a mirage. On September 16,1990, the student government of Bucknell University almost single-handedly eliminated any real sign of social and political progress that this cam pus has made in the past few years. With a 14-10 vote, the Reaganphil- lic young men and women passed a resolution to ban ""chalk-talk."" You ask why the big deal? Well, chalk- talk showed me that there were some minds on this campus that were capable of doing more than just computing the three most"
"When this (roll call) vote is requested, it",
is supposed to immediately become,
public knowledge....,"essential elements of life: GPA, cups still remaining in a keg, and the all-important size of their bank accounts. It showed that this cam pus had a true social conscience, and was interested in true progress. So just what made this propo sal any more important than any other BSG has passed? Well, this proposal fit nicely within that school policy for which I have now run out of adjectives and meta phors. In other words, if the stu dents did not want chalk-talk because of how disgusting it makes the campus look (you know...look at all the major dam age it has done), I feel that would have been the only reason the administration needed to at least put limits on this criminal act. With that problem behind, we all could have gone on believing that all is perfect in the bubble. Well, it was realized how important this proposal was, so the next week the student govern ment gave themselves another chance to examine the issue, and lo and behold, the resolution was over turned, once again removing the lethal weapon status from a piece of chalk. For this issue, a congress member requested a roll call vote. That is where everyone must vote individually, and not by the normal show of hands. This is a way of checking on just what side of the political fence each person stands. When this vote is requested, it is supposed See BSG, page 11"

Junior agrees with Mass opinion,"To the Editor: I am not usually one to write a letter to a newspaper, or even express my opinions verbally on campus, but this week I found it necessary to change this. I am responding to an Opinion's article in last week's Bucknellian in which a senior student expressed her views about the Catholic mass and community on campus. I am a member of the Steer ing Committee for CCM (Catholic Campus Ministry), and every Sun day for the past two years I have attended the 4:00 pm mass in Rooke Chapel. Every Sunday I too have felt the lack of student partici pation and warmth that should be present during a service geared to the college community. Something is different this year and I am glad that other students besides the CCM members are noticing. No longer do I feel apathetic or disap pointed when leaving church, but instead I feel genuinely uplifted and closer to my fellow Catholic students. As each Sunday passes, mass is becoming more crowded and Bucknellians are smiling and actually singing together. For those of you who have never attended a Catholic mass on campus, you may not understand what an astounding difference this semester is from ones past For stu dents who have tried coming to mass before, yet haven't experi enced the new service this year, I encourage you to attend. Granted, we could not have done it without the guidance of our new priest Father Angelo Maraldo, but he could not have made this difference by himself. I'd like to believe that deep down all of us had this spirit within us, and we were just looking for a way to let it out. Each week a few of us returned to church hoping that it might have changed and it would give us that feeling of a community which many of us were accustomed to at home. Well, now it has changed and instead of run ning out of church as soon as mass is over, students socialize after wards, and that feeling of commu nity is continuing to grow. I'd like to thank everyone for the positive comments I've been hearing around campus about mass. It makes us in CCM feel that what we've been doing for the past few years is worthwhile. I'd also like to thank everyone for giving me a chance to feel I am actually part of a Catholic community on campus now. Finally, I want to encourage everyone who was as frustrated with the 4:00 p.m. mass in the past as I was to try it again. It makes a great study break, and hopefully it will mean something to you too! Sharon Bird'92 September 24,1990"
Chi Phi boycotts Senior Gift Drive,"To the Members of the 1990 Bucknell Senior Gift Drive Com mittee, their Administrative Super visors, and to Whom It May Concern: We, the Class of 1991 of the Chi Phi Fraternity, wish to inform the proper persons of our intentions not to contribute to the 1990 Senior Gift Drive. Our purpose in this decision is to indicate to the administration of this institution our sincere dissat isfaction with the University's inconsistent, underhanded, and clearly antagonistic policies regard ing Greek life. Hence we flatly refuse to support a tribute, lest it be misinterpreted as an approval of the University's recent actions. Why should we honor with our support an institution which has so vehe mently sought to destroy the way of life we enjoy? Fraternity and soror ity members comprise approxi mately 60% of the Bucknell under graduate population; this is an action to demonstrate the outrage of that large group. Clearly there are serious flaws in the Greek sys tem at Bucknell; to deny this would be ludicrous. The administration, however, has clearly embarked upon an effort which is aimed, despite their pacifying assurances, at the eventual destruction of the Greek system. While our contribu tions would surely not directly help the administration to pursue our demise, this is a symbolic gesture of defiance. Now more than ever we must speak out in defense of our treasured brotherhoods and sis terhoods. We refuse to fund our destruction. We furthermore wholeheart edly encourage other organizations within the Inter-Fraternity system, and our counterparts in the Panhel- lenic system, to follow our lead in protesting Bucknell University's persecution of the Greek System. Our decision should not be consid ered a spiteful or vicious attack upon Bucknell University as a learning institution, nor upon those persons who have chosen to work on or contribute to the Drive. Nei ther do we wish to cast doubt on the Senior Gift Drive itself; the Drive is a fine tradition, but Greek seniors should consider the mes sage they are sending with their donation. Most respectfully yours. The Chi Phi Class of 1991 September 23,1990 t / / / September 28,"

IIPIPIP^I,
vulgarity?,"By Laura Haden and Mark Leister The issue of censorship is one which touches all American citizens. One current example of controversy over censorship involved the banning of 2 Live Crew's albums and concerts. Many of you have probably never seen any of their lyrics before, yet have supported 2 Live Crew simply under the blanket of ""free speech."" Saturated with the music industry's continual blurbs on the ever-persecuted 2 Live Crew, Americans have been naively convinced that the controversy is unfounded. However, this summer I was finally allowed to review some of 2 Live Crew's ""good time"" lyrics through an opinion by George F. Will entitled ""Amer ica's Slide into the Sewer"" printed in the July 30, 1990 issue of Newsweek. Will's piece was the first opportu nity I found to critique the lyrics and their implications for myself. Reviewing the actual lyrics certainly altered my view on music censorship, but even more than that, his piece also caused me to re-examine that fine line between freedom of speech and simple vulgarity. Will's commentary speaks to issues affecting us at Bucknell, and I believe our community should be given an opportunity to sample questionable free speech as Will sees it I regret the offensiveness of what follows. How ever, it is high time adult readers sample the words that millions of young Americans are hearing. Which words are lyrics, which are testimony? In a Manhattan courtroom testimony continues in the trial of young men accused of gang rape - ............ . ................ and other sadistic vio lence against the Central Park jogger in last April's ""wilding"" epi sode. ""We charged her and we got her on the ground. Everybody started hitting her and # i # stuff, and she's on the ground and everybody's stomping and everything... I grabbed one arm, and this other kid grabbed one arm and we grabbed her legs and stuff. And then we took turns getting on her."" They did it for fun, for entertainment. ""After she was hit on the head with the pipe, did someone lake her clothes off?"" ""Yeah."" ""OK, who took her clothes off?"" ""All of us."" ""Did somebody have sex with her?"" ""Yeah."" ""Did a lot of people have sex with her?"" ""Yeah."" When arrested a defendant said, ""It was some thing to do. It was fun."" Where can you get the idea that sexual violence against women is fun? From a music store, through Walkman earphones, from boom boxes blaring forth the rap lyrics of 2 Live Crew: To have her walkin' funny we try to abuse it A big stinkingp-- y can't do it all So we try real hard just to bust the walls That is, bust the walls of women's vaginas. 2 Live Crew's lyrics exult in busting women--almost always called bitches -- in various ways, forcing anal sex, forcing women to lick feces. ""He' ll tear the p-- y open 'cause it's satisfaction."" ""Suck my d--k, bitch, it makes you puke."" That's entertainment. This is medicine. The jogger lost most of her blood, her temperature plunged to 85. Doctors strug gling to keep her alive had to tie down her arms and legs because, even hours after the attack, while in a coma that would last weeks, she was flailing and kick ing as if ""in a fighting stance."" Her face was so disfig ured a friend took 15 minutes to identify her. ""I recog nized her ring."" Do you recognize the relevance of 2 Live Crew? I'll break ya down and d--k ya long Bust your p-- y then break your backbone. The furor (if anything so evanescent can be called that) about 2 Live Crew has subsided, for two reason. Saturation journalism, print and broadcast, around the clock, quickly wrings the novelty out of sub jects, leaving them dry husks. Then, if someone raises the subject again, the answer is a journalistic shrug: ""Not again. We've already done that."" But for 2 Live Crew the tour rolls on and the money rolls in. Anyway, the ""fury"" over the lyrics was feigned. It had to be because everyone dependent on journalism did not learn what the offending words were. Media coverage was characterized by coy abstractness, an obscuring mist of mincing, supercilious descriptions of the lyrics as ""explicit"""

From the jogger trial: ""Steve was hold- ing her with his leg and someone was rip ping off her clothes and pulling her down. She screamed and Steve held her while Kevin pulled down his pants and had sex with her. Steve hit her with a brick twice."" Fact: Some members of a particular age and social cohort--the one making 2 Live Crew rich -- stomped and raped the jobber to the razor edge of death, for the fun of it. Certainty: the coarsening of a community, the desensitizing of a society will have behavioral consequences. Juan Williams of The Washington Post is black and disgusted. The issue, he writes, is the abuse of women, especially black women, and the corruption of young blacks' sensibilities, twisting their conceptions ""of good sex, good relationships and good times.""

Corpo rations sell civil pollution for profit; liberals rational ize it as virtuous tolerance in ""the marketplace of ideas."" Not to worry, yawn The New York Times edito rialists, ""The history of music is the story of innova tive, even outrageous styles that interacted, adapted and became mainstream."" Oh, I see: First Stravinsky's ""Rite of Spring,"" now 2 Live Crew's ""Me So Horny.""

There is nothing -- 1 # new about selling the talentless to the tasteless. What is new is the combina tion of extreme infantilism and menace in the profit- driven degeneration of popular entertainment. This slide into the sewer is greased by praise. When jour nalism flinches from presenting the raw reality, and instead says only that 2 Live Crew's lyrics are ""explicit"" and ""controversial"" and ""provocative,"" there is an undertone of approval. Antonyms of those adjectives are ""vague"" and ""bland"" and ""unchalleng ing."" Somehow we never reach the subject of busting vaginal walls. America today is capable of terrific intolerance about smoking, or toxic waste that threatens trout. But only a deeply confused society is more concerned about protecting lungs than minds, trout than black women. We legislate against smoking in restaurants; singing ""Me So Horny"" is a constitutional right. Sec ondary smoke is carcinogenic, celebration of torn vaginas is ""mere words."" Words, said Aristotle, are what set human beings, the language-using animals, above lower ani mals. Not necessarily. What are the common threads connecting Will's argument to Bucknell University? Our detachment from the ""real world"" does not shelter us from the issues of free speech, sexism, and blatant disregard for basic human respect. Last semester, the Bucknell com munity was bombarded with very similarly degrading rhetoric--so similar, in fact, that even the words sound the same.... In the May 11, 1990 issue of The Bucknellian, Jessica Henry, a Bucknell senior, brought a blatantly sexist incident to the attention of our community. A ""Step show"" performed by the Kappa Alpha Psi frater nity provoked this response: ..After an exciting first step dance, one of the Brothers explained there was something called a ""Kappa-tude."" At first amused by this witticism, / was soon seething. It seems this ""Kappa-tude"" gives the Kappa brothers license to completely degrade and mock women. According to their song, Kappas can ""cum"" in women's eyes, ears, and between their legs at any time and any place, and women love it--by virtue of their ""Kappa"" status. Another song consisted, in large part, of the phrase ""motherf- -- er."" I could not believe I had actu ally paid $4 to hear six men chant ""motherf -- er!!"" In the April 6, 1990 issue, J.T. Klopcic, a junior, penned his reaction to the messages he found scribbled on the cam pus' sidewalks, the handiwork of an organi zation calling itself M.U.F.F. (Men Upset by F-- ing Feminists):"
Gary Sojka,"...Quite simply, this chalk message read, ""A woman is first and fore most life support for a p -- y."" ...if the sexist remarks found scrawled on the sidewalk represent even a small sample of campus opinion, then the feminists' case for sexism here at Bucknell has been proven. Finally, even President Gary Sojka found the sexist and racist trends on campus to be intolerable, and chose to express his concern in his May 4, 1990 letter to the Editor: ...Offensive comments, lewd references, and unflatter ing portrayals of women and members of minority groups have appeared in chalk on the sidewalks or have been shouted at students in passing. There is, of course, a fine line between the exercise of free speech and harassment.... However, operating within the realm of protected free speech, some members of our community seem to take pleasure in taunting, abusing, and otherwise ""bashing"" their fellow students. It is my personal opinion that although protected speech may apply, such behaviors are clearly an abuse of the rigiu of free expression. I abhor the vulgarity, the malicious ness, the lack of sensitivity and tolerance such behav ior bespeaks. This is the point where Bucknell meets the out side world. These views that President Sojka expresses echo the voice of George Will. The abuses that we find on our own campus, protected under the pretense of free speech, are equivalent to those which make front page headlines of the nation's newspapers.

Bax C 3059,"Vice President Joey Krakoff-Y Treasurer Scott Serale-Y Any surprises? For your sakes I hope not, but I am sure that there are. The people listed above are your representatives, and it is your duty to see to it that they vote the way you want. So you ask what do I do? Well here are just a few things that I feel are necessary: 1) Never underestimate the power of BSG, or for that matter, any group on this campus. 2) Make sure that you express your feelings and concerns to your various representatives. They are called representatives because they are supposed to be representative of your feelings about an issue, regardless of whether they feel that is the case or not. 3) When the time comes, VOTE! If you don't you can be making a big mistake for yourself and others that feel the same way about issues that you do. This is a plea. Wake up. We have barely dodged one bullet. Can we dodge the next?

Freshman Forum,"By Jim Joseph None of us here at Bucknell are strangers to the mixed feelings which we all felt before our arrival at college. The end of summer was accompanied by a sense of great anticipation. Rather oddly, emotions such as fear and sorrow were common as well. Almost no one could have waited another week to depart from the eighteen year-old grasp of Mom and Dad. By the same token, few people wanted to say good bye to their high school sweethearts or part with the friends who had shared every special moment with you. But the hopes of freedom, par ties and new faces pulled you away from the familiar security blanket which you call ""home."" That was one month ago almost to the day. We have started to make new friends and we have certainly been to enough parties. In ret rospect, was it everything we expected? This is the lime when home starts to seem farther and farther away. As strange as it may seem, I have heard people say that they miss those same parents who thirty days ago were so ""restrictive and unfair."" I will not go as far as to call this homesickness, but I will say that in an environment where we have been faced with so many new and difficult experiences, it is expected that we will yearn for that security which is so hard to find in the hustle and bustle of college life. It is at this point in the year when we somehow ""forgot"" to do any of our English reading and it seems that all of our work is catching up with us instead of us with it. Our lives, so it may seem at times, are in a state of near total disarray. Is this really the independence and responsibility that we wanted for so many years? One girl assured me that it is not She tried to convince me that ""we should not have to do work at college. It should be a social learning experience."" In many ways it is. We are slowly being introduced to the state of confusion which we call life. Isn't it fun? As semi-reality crashes down on us freshmen, people begin to panic. It is my advice to sit back, calm down and put things in perspec tive. While your social life and grades are important, let's try to pre serve a little sanity. When the experience is over, friendships and grades will more than likely be more stable than they are now and we will be able to look back and examine the results. I am sure that the good times will greatly outweigh the bad and fond memories of Buck nell will dominate our memories. Let's hope I'm right! In the mean time let's make the most of the future and, above all else, enjoy our selves. After all, happiness is paramount. page 12 The Bucknellian September 28, 1990"

Living Colour comes on strong,"By Jon Elliot In 1988, Living Colour released their debut album entitled Vivid, which gained mainstream acceptance with such MTV hits as ""Cult of Personality"" and ""Glamour Boys;"" yet many labeled Corey Glover, Vemon Reid, Muzz Skillings and Wil liam Calhoun as the up-and- coming ""black rock and roll band"" to hit the pop charts. But to the educated histo rian, musical or otherwise, it was such artists as Little Rich ard, Chuck Berry, Fats Domino as well as the countless number of African-American blucsmen (and women) who actually ""invented"" what has been labeled Rock and Roll by main- j stream America. Living Colour, on Time's Up (Epic), their second release to date, seem to acknowledge the sizeable majority of misin formed consumers who have placed this unwanted and unde served label upon their name. Following a punk/thrasher sound on the opening title track, a sound and tempo quite repre- sentitive of the talents of Reid, one of the newest guitar masters to hit the music scene in years, Living Colour gives a short, non musical track which attempts to start explaining the current trends in popular music which find its roots in African culture (In Africa, music is not an art form as much as it is a means of communication/ Quite often the words of the song are meaningless). This is followed with Reid's hard licks and Calhouns hard beat on ""Pride,"" which is a ""history"" piece devoted to ultimately explain ing where, in fact, the group stands on the ""black rock and roll band"" eye-opening rhetoric, the mood seems to be lost in what is Reid's only attempt on Time's Up to release himself from the album's theme, that being a cultural educa tion of the masses."

With a guest ""rap"" by Little Rich ard, talk of Elvis being spotted in shopping malls creates a light tone on a subject which Reid creatively manipulates to fit the album's theme (Elvis was a hero to most/ But that's beside the point/ A Black man taught him how to sing/ And then he was crowned king). 'Type,"" the first single and MTV video from the album, is undoubtably the pinnacle of this considerably solid work. What follows in the remaining seven tracks is, lyrically, in step with the first half of the album, but musically Living Colour is one creative step beyond. ""Information Overload"" opens with a computerized, syn thesized gut-wrenching Vemon |  Reid lead, ultimately blending into a solid prucussion sound. It is Queen Lalifah and Doug E. Fresh (of Rap fame) who lend their vocal ability to the bass syndrome into which they have fal len (You like our hair/ You love our music/Our culture's large, so you abuse it/ Take lime to under stand, I'm an equal man). This burst of energy gener ated in ""Pride"" seems to be lost in ""Love Rears Its Ugly Head."" In an album full of cnlightnment and"

Poet in profile,"Courtesy of Public Relations By Christena Johnston Lisa Coffman (pictured at left) is Bucknell University's resi dent poet for the sememster. Coff man was bom in Virginia and grew up in Tennessee. She became inter ested in poetry at an early age, -but chose not to pursue this interest in college. Instead, Coffman majored in computer science at the Univer sity of Tennessee. It was at college that Coffman took a writing work shop and realized her true interest. Following her college graduation in 1985, Coffman went to New York University to complete her masters degree in the University's writing program. Coffman writes poetry and fiction. Her fiction has appeared in ""Violet."" Her poetry, drawn from family, history, friends and stories collected from personal experi ences, is a type of lyrical verse about herself or those she knows. Her works have been published in ""Arc,"" ""The Minetta Review,"" and ""West Branch,"" Bucknell's literary magazine. Currently, Coffman is explor ing with free verse and experiment ing with different forms, meters, rhythms and styles in her poetry. Although Coffman also writes short stories, she gravitates toward poetry since she finds it easier to work with poems than stories. In addition to writing poetry, Coffman is a staff writer for The North Jersey Herald and News. At times she thought she wanted to teach, but decided that being a jour nalist and having a job in the ""real"" world would be the best thing to do. Being a journalist however, is more difficult than one expects. Currently she is enjoying campus life at Bucknell and having a chance to break free of New York City, where she has lived for four years. She is thrilled to be the resi dent poet at Bucknell, and she is happy to be recognized on campus as a poet as it is oftentimes difficult to be recognized solely on the basis of one's writing. Coffman's stay at Bucknell will be a real shaping time fo her work since she has the opportunity to concentrate on her writing every day. Coffman's goal is to create a book of peotry. Along with her writing, she is collaborating on a creative writing workshop, and helping to critique poems. She is"

Rhythm Kings,
entertain alumni,"By Ally Kambach On September 22, The Man hattan Rhythm Kings performed at the Weis Center. The three mem bers, Hal Shane, Brian Nalepka, and Tripp Hanson, performed music from the 20's, 30's, and 40's. The Rhythm Kings have appeared at Carnegie Hall, Radio City Music Hall, and the Kennedy Center. They toured Russia with Broadway star Tommy Tune in 1988. They have been a part of several PBS music specials includ ing the Emmy Award-wining ""Cel ebrating Gershwin"". The group has appeared with artists such as George Bums, Dom Dcluise, Judy Collins, Helen Reddy, Gregory Hines, Chita Riv era, and the Rockettes. Recently they completed their third album. The concert was the climax of a weekend designed to celebrate the end of Bucknell University's fund raising campaign. The audi ence, the majority of whom were contributing alumni, had been treated to a weekend of activities in thanks for their generous gifts and pledges. The performance was pro ceeded by an elaborate dinner for the alumni which was held in the Fieldhouse. $90.9 million was raised for the University in its recent campaign. The Rhythm Kings combined classic music with tap dancing to create a show which was musically and visually exciting. Accompa nied by pianist Jeremy Kahn and drummer Amie Kinsella, the trio was free to dramatize their selec tions. The tap dancing by Shane and Hanson was enthusiastically received by the audience. Songs performed, such as ""Yes Sir, That's My Baby"" and ""Puttin' On The Ritz"", bridged the generation-gap so that young and old were able to enjoy the same sounds. People who shyed away from this evening of ""classic music"" turned their backs on the beginings of rock and roll. Their enjoyment of the music spilled into the audi ence. Enthusiasm was the over whelming effect. I enjoyed listen ing to this distinctly different sound. also available to students to discuss their writing from 2:15 to 3:15p.m. every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Her office is located in Bucknell Hall. Coffman is also involved in a modem dance class which she finds extremely interesting as it is ""cross training in another art."" Although she won't be dancing in perfor mances, the dance company has expressed interest in choreograph ing a piece to one of her poems for a December dance recital.

Joe Ely opens next Friday night,
Texas Roadhouse Rock n ' Roller opens for Little Feat in Davis Gym,"Courtesy of Vector Management Joe Ely will be opening for Little Feat next Friday night at 8 p.m. in Davis Gym. Ely has received national acclaim over the past 20 years as a talented musician. By Lee Guzofski Greetings once again Bucknellians! It is I returning to offer my insights into the world of cinema. This week I had the pleasure of viewing Presumed Innocent starring Harrison Ford, Brian Dennehy, and Bonnie Bedelia. This film was an adapta tion of Scott Turow's novel of the same title. A novel which I, regrettably, have not yet read. But then I think, who cares? I review movies, not novels... This was the story of Rusty Sabitch, district attorney extraordinaire who is framed for the murder of one of his col leagues, Carolyn Polhemus. However, she wasn't just any colleague; au contraire dear reader, Rusty had a torrid love affair with her, an affair that threatened to end his marriage. (Ooh, ooh, twist that plot!) At any rate, she has been ruthlessly killed in what appears to be a rape attempt and Rusty, upstand ing member of the community and all-around neato guy, is sud denly thrust into the role of prime suspect. The rest of the story revolves around Rusty's attempts to prove his innocence. To tell any more of the plot would be to do a cruel injustice to you, the reader... Firstly, Harrison Ford is my favorite actor on the face of the planet. Not that you care, but I wanted to get that out of the way because I was biased from the start. However, this film has actual merits of its own, even though Ford trades in his fedora and bullwhip for a briefcase and wingtips. The plot twists and winds its way from one suspense ful scene to another, leaving the viewer breathless. Ford is bril liant in his role as the plagued prosecutor although his haircut is the most pathetic ""do"" since his role in Blade Runner. Bonnie Bedela, formerly known only for her role as Bruce Willis' wife in the Die Hard films, plays a stun ningly intriguing wife. Okay, here's the deal: Harrisoiv Ford kicks big box-office tushie with his amazing portrayal. The story is entrancing, throwing doubt on virtually everyone, even up to the very end. WOW, what a flick! In summation, I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys an intelligent, suspenseful, bril liant movie that leaves the audi ence feeling completely satisfied and involved with the characters. If this sort of quality film doesn't appeal to you; well, there's always Robocop 2... Thank you, have a nice yesterday and a pleasant next Thursday. By Cynthia Levinson Staff Writer Next Friday, Joe Ely, noted guitarist and singer will be opening for Little Feat. Ely has been play ing Texas roadhouse rock for the past twenty years. He released his first album, titled Joe Ely (MCA), in 1977, and he has continued to perform and record throughout the past two decades. The band which Ely currently plays with has been with him for five years. Ely finds that his inspi ration comes from his band. ""The band has always influenced the way I approach a song and the way that I sing it."" That influence should be loud and clear in Ely's performance next Friday night. His band's influence on his music should also be quite notica- ble in his new album, Live at Lib erty Lunch (MCA), which will be released in mid-October. The album was recorded last spring at Austin's Liberty Lunch. It is Ely's sixth album on MCA, but he also has a couple of albums produced by other recording companies. Throughout his career, Ely has made tour appearances with greats such as The Rolling Stones and Tom Petty. Around the time of Down on the Drag (MCA), Ely's album released in 1979, The Joe Ely Band was invited to tour with The Clash in Europe. Other national acclaim which Ely has recently received was the naming of his album, Masquerade (MCA), as ""one of the top albums to emerge from the 1970s."" It seems as if time is on Ely's side, as each year his natioal rec- ogntion increases, and he becomes more publicly recognized as a solid musician. In the past decade Ely has performed at Live Aid and appeared on The Roy Orbison Trib ute, and famous singers such as #Linda Ronstadt have personally recognized Ely's talent. She was noted as saying, ""Joe Ely is a true original. This is real Texas Rock and Roll at it's finest"" The Joe Ely Band is expected to produce a strong opening act. Ely's attitiude about the stage is one of enthusiasm as well as respect for the audience. ""Before I step foot on a stage, I make certain thet I'm damn-sure ready. I don't get on the stage if I'm feeling just ho-hum. I am cosiderate of every crowd, whether it's in Helsinki or Amarillo, it doesn't matter where I am. If people have enough time to get out of their houses to see a band, I'm going to give it every ounce that I've got, for every single show. You can count on it"" Little Feat and The Joe Ely Band will be performing next Fri- day night at 8 p.m. in Davis Gym. Little Feat will be featuring their recently released album, Represent ing the Mambo."
Quartet with a twist,
Soldier String Quartet gives,
classical music a new image,"By Joyce Dollinger On Wednesday, the Soldier String Quartet, performing classi cal, jazz, and avant-garde type music, will make their first Buck nell appearance. The group's per formance will mark the beginning of the Gallery Series musical per formances of the year. The series is performed in the Center Gallery of the Elaine Langone Center. The ""Quartet"" was formed during the spring of 1985 by Dave Soldier who is the leading musician and composition writer for the group. His music uses ""poly rhythms and syncopations derived from funk and serial techniques and frequently include rock drum sets,"" which he sythesized from working with Bo Diddley in the past. Mr. Soldier also has a Ph.D in neurobi ology from Columbia University. The other members of the group are: Laura Seaton, first vio linist; Ron Lawrence, violinist; and Mary Wooten, cellist. On Wednes day the Soldier Suing Quartet will have a fifth musician. Michael Suchorsky is a drummer who toured six years with Lou Reed. He will be accompanying the band for the evening. The extensive repertoire of The Soldier String Quartet might cause some confusion among new listeners The ""Quartet"" plays vari ous types of music in order to express their varying ideas and var ying musical tastes. The group's music represents at least fifty new works by different artists such as; Elliott Sharp, who leads a new wave band called Car bon, Nicholas Collins, Ivan Wysch- negradsky, Iannis Xenakis, Joanne Brackeen, Teo Macero, Diana Mecklley and Richard Peaslee. The Quartet entertains as well as records albums with; Elliott Sharp & Carbon, Amina Claudine Myers, Tom Cora, Nicholas Collins, Wil liam Schimmel, the Tango Project, Teo Macero and the"
SEM,"Ensemble. In addition, the Quartet is currently in residence for the Amer ican Festival of Microtonal Music. They also play the annotated works by some American greats like Muddy Waters, James Brown, and Tito Puente. The Soldier String Quartet has two albums out, Sequence Girls (Rift Records), focusing on the music of Dave Soldier, and Hammer, Anvil, Stirrup (SST), collaborated by Elliott Sharp for the group. Their third album, Sojourner Truth (Newport Clas sics), will appear in January of 1991. Although the name might be deceiving at first, the Soldier String Quartet is not your typical ties and tails quartet. The group's style and repertoire are quite different from the traditional notion of clssical music. During the past year the group has been receiving a good deal of attention in New York City and has played at Lincoln Center and at city clubs, such as CBGB's. They have also traveled throughout Europe and North America on tour. The Soldier String Quartet will be performing Wednesday at 8 p.m. in the Center Gallery. The concert is titled ""Five Little Mon sters."" The Gallery Series is open and ftee to the public."

Water polo plays well against nation's best,"by Scott Pollins Staff Writer Two weekends ago, Buck- nell's water polo squad traveled to the U.S. Naval Academy in Annap olis for the annual Eastern League Tournament, featuring the top polo squads this side of the Mississippi. The Bison first played Army in what Coach Lynn Kachmarick called ""a very solid game."" Bucknell came out strong and never looked back. After jumping to a commanding 7-2 halftime edge over the Cadets, the squad cruised to an 11-5 victory. John Zeigler '91 and Walter Kelly '92 led the way with three goals apiece. Kevin Schroth '92 and Kelly also contrib uted three assists. John Bradbury '92 played a superb game in goal, registering 12 saves. Bucknell's second game was against Brown, the tournament's top seed. Though the Bison gave a Colin Bridgewater/The Bucknellian With two defenders converging on him, Walter Kelly '92 searches for a teammate.

Volleyball falls,
to Villanova,"By Todd Bianchine Staff Writer The Bucknell volleyball team traveled to Villanova last Tuesday for its final preseason matchup, after having a week of practice on sisky '92, who had nine kills and a .545 hitting percentage in the match, and Meg Kinney '92, who was good for seven kills and a .364 hitting percentage. Kathleen Sulli van '92 made her presence felt at the net as she sent back three Villa- Peter Ho/The Bucknellian Middle blocker Kathleen Sullivan '92 attempts to reject an oppo nent's spike. The Lady Bison have instituted a new 6-2 ofTense in order to better utilize setters Dee Scinta '92 and Mary Jordan '93. their new 6-2 offense. However, the Wildcats were ready to meet the challenge when the Lady Bison arrived. Villanova took three straight games from the squad 15- 10, 15-8, 15-5, dropping Bucknell's record to 2-7. ""If there is such a thing as playing well and losing, then we did it,"" said Coach Opalski. The Lady Bison went right after the Wildcats from the opening serve with their 6-2 offense, a for mation which utilizes two setters. The key players in the 6-2, Dee Scinta '92 and Mary Jordan '93, who dished out a total of 28 assists for the match, with senior co captain Kris Colbert putting down ten for kills. Other good bearers of the 6-2 were co-captain Kara Foro- nova spikes, and Scinta was able to come up with five digs. 'They [Villanova] had a really impressive warm-up, but our kids were not intimidated,"" said first-year assistant coach Anne Marie Larese. ""We played really well in spurts, but we were just lacking a little consistency in our serve reception."" Bucknell will try to improve upon their league-leading .282 hit ting percentage when they travel to West Point to take on Army tomor row in their first Patriot League match of the season. The Lady Bison will also face Colgate, another member of the Patriot League, while they are at Army. See VOLLEYBALL, page 17 tremendous effort, they bowed to the Bears in double overtime, 8-6. Tim Smaldone '90 led Bucknell with a hat trick of three goals, while Zeigler added three assists. The Bison played their third and final game of the day against arch-rival Iona. Though tired fol lowing an already long afternoon, Bucknell registered a fine perfor mance before yielding 10-7. Kelly led a balanced attack of seven Bison scorers, contributing two goals. Smaldone and Chris Retzler '92 added two assists apiece. The next day, Bucknell played its final game of the long tournament against Princeton. Kachmarick simply stated, ""We played great and won."" Schroth led the Bison with a couple of goals and three assists, while Kelly scored a triplet of goals and added a single assist in an 11-6 winning effort. John Bradbury played exceptionally in goal, tallying nine saves. This win capped what Coach Kachmarick dubbed ""a great week end."" Bucknell finished 7th among a field of 16 teams. This past weekend, the polo team traveled to Brown University in Providence for what proved to be a very challenging tournament. Bucknell played the top three teams in the nation: #1 Cal-Berkley, #2 UCLA, and #3 Cal-Irvine. The Cal ifornia teams overpowered Buck nell and won easily, but Kachma rick stressed, ""We were able to leam something from each game. Even though we lost big, the team stayed tough, and never gave up."" With this past weekend behind them, the polo team is look ing forward to another competitive weekend at Villanova for the Wild cat Invitational Tournament. The Bison will face Johns Hopkins and Cornell in the opening two rounds. The polo squad has made some great strides thus far this sea son. Kachmarick notes, ""You can not only measure success by wins and losses. It's the attitude and growth of our team, which has con tinued to be the best group I have ever coached here."" With the strong support of their coach behind them and and intense competitive attitude within them, Bucknell should rank favora bly against its upcoming opponents. I Colin Bridgewater/The Bucknellian Dan Killinger '92 zeroes in on the goal just prior to releasing a shot. The Bison water polo squad gained some valuable experience this past weekend as they clashed with the top three teams in the nation: #1 Cal-Berkeley, #2 UCLA, and #3 Cal-Irvine."
Golf places tenth out of fifteen,
in Georgetown Invitational,"By Jamie Diaferia The golf team participated in the Georgetown Invitational last weekend in Fredericksburg, Vir ginia, placing tenth in a fifteen- team field. The tournament indi cated definite signs of improvement from the F&M Sheraton Tourna ment a week earlier, in which Bucknell finished fifteenth in the 24-team tournament. At Georgetown the Bison averaged eighty strokes per person which, according to Coach Tommy Thompson, is regarded as an excel lent score, especially for such a young team. With the success of the past weekend, the Bucknell golfers are looking ahead to the Susquehanna Tournament on September 28th, in which Thompson has decided to go with a revamped team. The Bison opened last week end's tournament on a sunny Fri day by shooting a combined 322, which was two strokes better than the opening round of the F&M tour nament a week earlier. Don Hansen '94 led the team once again, shooting a 77, followed by Scott Miller '93, who shot a respectable 79. Doug Dollenberg '94 and Dave Fries '93 also played well, shooting 82 and 84 respec tively, while captain Mike Smigie '92 struggled a bit early on, shoot ing an 89. The scores for the day repre sented significant improvement for the team, thus gaining them confi dence for the next day. Along with the arrival of the second day of the tournament came * the rain, as play was delayed for 45 minutes. The team played well despite the conditions, as Hansen once again led the team, shooting a 74, and finishing at 151 for the two days, good enough to place 13th overall. Dollenberg shot a 79 to fin ish at 161, in 38th place. Fries, Smi gie and Miller also played well, as they shot 80, 84 and 86 respectively. Hansen was pleased with the results, remarking, ""It was really encouraging that, despite the inclement weather, the team was able to gain ground and surpass some teams like Seton Hall."" Dollenberg agreed, saying, ""The team's score in the tourna ment was encouraging, but still allows us room for improvement"" Coach Thompson was espe cially excited about the way the team played over the weekend. ""There was definite improvement since last week,"" he said. ""I am very encouraged. To finish tenth when you're playing with teams like Princeton and William and Mary is impressive. We're getting closer to having four good scores each time out, and now we are just looking to break 310."" With the Susquehanna Tour nament coming up, Thompson has decided to go without three of his regular players, as he is opting to try three untested players. Hansen and Miller will be joined by Glenn Hertzberg '92, Chris Curti '94, in addition to a player yet to be named. The tournament will be a one day affair, and will not include the caliber of teams that have been included in the last couple of tournaments. ""The tournament is important for us in that it will determine how some of the other players can play under pressure,"" said Thompson. ""So far I have been pleased with the way our freshmen, Dollenberg and Hansen, have responded to the tournaments. Now I want to see some other players."" This, and other future tourna ments, are all ""tune-ups"" according to Thompson, as the ECAC Fall Championships rapidly approach in mid-October. ""That is when we want to do well,"" said Thompson. ""I am very optimistic."""

"Beats Lafayette, loses to Lehigh","#EgSgi- g a s a s s i By Christopher Mosunic Staff Writer The Bucknell women's tennis team remained at .500 after a 1-1 weekend, as they defeated Lafay ette on Saturday but fell to Lehigh on Sunday. The Lady Bison put on a strong performance each day and kept their record even at 2-2. In the Lady Bison's match at Lafayette, Bucknell was led by its strong doubles squads and out standing single performances by Karen Stagliano '92, Stephanie Ryer '91, and Kymm Carlson '94. Bucknell came out on fire and held on for the remainder of the match. Coach Ewan com mented, ""This is the first time in a number of years that we have beaten Lafayette. Every team mem ber contributed to this win."" Stagliano led Bucknell's charge against the Leopards, drill ing her opponent 6-0,6-2. Also winning their singles matches were Carlson and Ryer. Carlson pummeled her oppo sition 6-0, 6-4. Ryer took the first set easily, but she had her hands full in the second. The set went game for game until the players reached a tiebreaker. Each competi tor matched one another point for point. At 6-all Ryer took two straight to take the tiebreaker 8-6 and the match. Each of the doubles teams performed admirably. Though all three matches went three sets, Bucknell was victorious in every effort. Mary Ann Benack '92 and Carlson played fiercely, winning the first set and forcing a tiebreaker in the second.

Field hockey loses to Colgate in OT,"By Todd Bianchine Staff Writer Patriot League foe Colgate defeated the Lady Bison field hockey team 1-0 in a hard-fought overtime battle yesterday. Goalie Danielle Ward '93 played remarkably, making 14 saves, before Colgate attacker Ruthie Lynn sewed the game's lone goal 7:37 into the overtime period. The loss dropped Bucknell's record to 1-6 (0-2 in the Patriot League). Colgate improved its record to 4-1-1 (2-0). With its second conference match behind them, the field hockey team has only two confer ence games remaining in the 1990 season. There will be no confer ence playoffs this year for the Patriot league, and the only playoffs in which the Bison could aspire to compete would be the E.C.A.C., which invites teams with .500 records or better. Conse quently, the Lady Bison are con centrating on improving their play and in turn, their record. Last Saturday, the Lady Bison gave their best performance to date despite losing the game 1-0 to Patriot League opponent Holy Cross. Holy Cross is an up-and- coming team that has defeated such well-established teams as Brown and Boston College by no less than three goals each this year. The game was characterized by strong midfield and defensive play which held the game in a scoreless deadlock until late in the second half.

W omen's soccer beats Wilkes,
in capturing first varsity win,"From page 15 match. Stagliano and Kim Thomp son '93 were pushed to three sets in their 6-2,2-6,6-0 victory. Ryer and Jennifer Wyckoff '92 had one of the most exciting matches of the day. Their first set was lost to a strong duo 4-6. But in the second the Lady Bison regained their composure, winning the sec ond set tiebreaker 7-3. Then Bucknell finished off its final doubles victory of the after noon, as Ryer and Wyckoff won the third set 6-4. Bucknell played tough against against Lehigh, but lost to the Engineers 5-4. Coach Ewan was extremely happy with the teams' play. She said, ""In the past Lehigh has beaten us 9-0; to go 4-5 with them was terrific."" Stagliano and Ryer were vic torious in their singles play, and Benack played well in defeat. In doubles action, Lehigh's two top players just couldn't be beat. Benack and Carlson played well, but Lehigh was hot and would not let the Bison mount a formida ble challenge. The #2 and #3 Lady Bison doubles teams came through with victories. Thompson and Stagliano, and Wyckoff and Ryer cruised to victories in their respective matches. The team will host Delaware tomorrow, and St. Francis Sunday. By Anne Taback Staff Writer The Bucknell women's soc cer team got its first victory at var sity status Wednesday with a 5-0 win against Wilkes University. The team was confident and excited going into the game. According to Coach Toby Lovec- chio, ""they were up for this. After the game was cancelled at Penn, their anticipation increased and they were looking to win."" The team's confidence finally paid off. Early in the game, Buck nell midfielder Amanda Head '92 rocketed a shot that Colonel goal keeper Diane Gibbs barely deflected wide of the net. Keeping the offensive pressure. Lady Bison forward Kathy Ott '91 passed to Chris O'Lare '93, who drilled a shot from eight yards out for the first Bucknell tally at 3:36. The goal marked the first time this season that the Lady Bison had the opening score. From page 15 Aurand '92 said,"" We played our best game so far and the concepts we have worked on are falling into place--the team is starting to gel."" The Lady Bison had good defen sive contributions from center back Dana Bruce '92, fullback Amber Baxter '92, stalwart goalie Danielle Ward '93, and right mid-field Aurand. Ward made nine saves in the game and is fourth in the con- Bucknell's second goal came at 9:08, when sweeper Stephanie Porcaro '93 passed to midfielder Christina Baselga '91. Baselga notched her first assist of the game when she fed the ball back to Por- caro, who fired a 25-yard shot into the back of the net. Midfielder Janine Hudson '93 followed with Bucknell's third score of the game at 24:17 in the first half. Forward Amy Krause '91 passed to Baselga, who took a shot that rebounded off the keeper. Hud son was there to follow up with a shot about seven yards away from the net In the second half, right back Gettine Strecper '92 made a direct kick 30-yards out into the top of the box. Forward Alyssa Meade '94 took control of the ball and then took a 17-yard shot that found the back of the net The last goal of the game came in the second half, when at 40:38 Ott was able to score on a cross from forward Tina Fields '94. ference with a save percentage of .856. The Bison have struggled throughout the year to play two strong halves back to back. After last Saturday, the team have shown that it can face a top-ranked team such as Holy Cross and be strongly competitive. Throughout most of the sec ond half, the Bison fought hard to turn back the advances of the Lady Crusaders and generate a cohesive Although the Lady Bison had built a commanding lead going into the second half, Lovecchio said, ""They played for ninety min utes. They played hard the whole game."" The game was a big victory for the Lady Bison, as it boosted their morale. According to Lovec chio, ""We went almost a month without getting a victory and that's a long time. This was great for them. They've worked hard, they've never given up and it finally came... they deserved to get this victory."" Midfielder Julie Cooling '94 agrees, ""The ability was always there and we just put everything together. We're a lot more confi dent."" Lovecchio labeled Cooling as a tireless worker. Bucknell displayed great skill on the field. The defense was solid; Wilkes only had seven shots, opposed to Bucknell's 29, and the game was mostly played in their half of the field. attack of their own. It looked as though the score would remain tied until, with ten minutes remaining in the game, Holy Cross converted offensive surge into a goal. The goal was controversial, according to both the players and Coach Averill. ""It was a blatant off sides,"" exclaimed high strung coach Averill. The Holy Cross forward dribbled past the Bison defense and towards Bucknell goalie Ward, creating a one-on-one situation. The defense kept the Colo nels from having any good opportu nities for shots. Goalkeeper Bridget Collins '94 played the entire game and had many excellent saves. The team has improved its work on headers as well. Lovecchio commented, ""The girls directed the ball with their heads instead of hit ting it anywhere which is some thing we were trying to work on. We were passing the ball well, moving to go to a space or to create something. That was nice to see."" Lovecchio feels that every person that played contributed in one way or another. He said, ""Eve ryone got to play a fair amount of time...we used 18 players. It was a good team effort."" Tomorrow's game against Lehigh is being postponed. The Lady Bison's next game is Tuesday, when the team will host Gettysburg at 4 p.m. Says Cooling, ""We're glad to have the win now and we're looking to beat Gettysburg. We really want a winning season."" Behind the Bucknell defense, a sec ond Holy Cross forward camped out by the goal for the pass and slammed it home, giving Ward no time to react The Lady Bison refused to accept defeat and made one last valiant effort which was rejected by the Holy Cross defense at their own goal line. Aurand explained, 'Though we could not capitalize, we worked hard to hold them to one goal. The score does not reflect the effort involved,"" commenting on the disappointing loss. Coach Averill praised her team by saying, ""I have seen great progress in their play and they've shown an aggressive style as well as good anticipation [of their oppo nent's moves]."" The Bison will travel to Eas ton, Pennsylvania, this Saturday to face Patriot league power, and Bucknell nemesis Lafayette. So far this year Lafayette has continued its annual winning campaign and has posted a record of 4-1-0 with no conference, games to date. Lafayette, like Holy Cross, is anti cipated to be an aggressive and fast team. Best Fundraiser<<; on Camnus!

From,
leftfield,"By Mark Griffith and Erk Smith Staff Writers In a follow-up to our daring football forecast two weeks ago, we have returned with more fearless predictions regarding some of this week's NFL action. For the past week and a half, we have crossed the country to bring you nothing but the most accurate, reliable, up-to-the- minute report on eight teams vying for Sunday supremacy. Miami Dolphins (2-1) at Pittsburgh Steelers (1-2), 1 p.m. Favorite: Miami by 1 1/2 Though the Dolphins will be hard pressed to score points against another superb defensive unit, the Steelers have been hard pressed to score points against anyone this year. Look for the aerial attack of Dan Marino to eventually crack the Steel Curtain, as Miami squeaks by in a low scoring game. A field goal should be the difference, so take the Dolphins and give the point and a half. Chicago Bears (3-0) at Los Angeles Raiders (3-0), 4 p.m. Favorite: Los Angeles by 1 In this battle of undefeated teams, look for defense to control the tempo of this classic match-up. Since both squads have dominating defenses, we feel that offense will be the deciding factor. Behind the strong running of Neal Anderson plus the better-than-anticipated play of Jim Harbaugh, the Bears will end the Raiders' perfect home record under Art Shell. Take Chicago plus one. New York Jets (1-2) at New England Patriots (1-2), 4 p.m. Favorite: Pick 'em Following a tough Monday night loss to the Buffalo Bills, the Jets have an opportunity to regroup against one of the league's weaker teams. New England is still reeling from the 41-7 thrashing at the hands of Cincinnati, and we expect the Jets to run up the score in this game as well. The only problem is that the Jets Swiss cheese defense has proven that they too can be manhandled. The Jets should prevail, but watch for an offensive explosion (or a defensive collapse, which ever you prefer). Washington Redskins (2-1) at Phoenix Cardinals (1-2), 8 p.m. Favorite: Washington by 7 When these two teams squared-off three weeks ago, the Red skins impressed everyone with a 31-0 hammering of the Cardinals. But times have changed, and so have the Redskins. Since the opening week, Washington has lost to the 49ers, and barely beat the lowly Cowboys at home. This week, the 'Skins will be operating without their starting quarterback, Mark Rypien. And don't forget Phoenix showed some life shocking division rival Philadelphia two weeks ago. Though Washington might prevail, seven points is too much to con cede. Take the Cardinals plus a touchdown. Extra Point For anyone who doubts the might of the Oakland Athletics, please note that the A's starting centerfielder has all but wrapped-up the National League batting title."
Volleyball,"From page 15 Individual league leaders for Bucknell include Jordan, who is second in service aces with 15 in 27 games, Colbert, who is second in blocks with 1.1 per game, and Sullivan, who is fourth in blocks with .89 per game. ""Overall we are playing at a much higher level,"" stated Opalski. ""We're much more consistent and intense. If our captains (Colbert and Forosisky) are playing well, we play well because they are our cata lysts.

Todd Hatajik '91,"After a day in which he orchestrated a 41-16 victory over Columbia University, Bison quarterback Todd Hatajik '91 sur faced as the clear choice for Athlete of the Week honors. Hatajik utilized precision passing, completing 18 of 21 passes for 224 yards and four touchdowns. His completion percentage of .857 surpassed the previous Bucknell record, set by Scott Auchenbach last season. The four touchdown passes equalled the school record, which is shared by five players. Hatajik's performance earned him the honor of Patriot League Offensive Player of the Week. Each of the previous seasons, Hatajik has served as the understudy to Auchenbach, Bucknell's All-time passing leader. Hatajik will attempt to once again lead the Bison to victory this Saturday at Cornell."

Hatajik leads football to 41 -16 victory,
Bison travel to Cornell tomorrow looking for first 3-1 start since,"ered 63 yards before Hatajik threw his first pass. After Hatajik called two consecutive time-outs without running a play, he found Pape in traffic for a nine-yard touchdown, extending the Bison's lead to 24- after Columbia's Tom Boccafola missed a 46-yard field goal. The Bison marched 71 yards in 11 plays, taking almost five min utes off the clock before Hatajik, on third and eight, connected with Lester Erb '91 for a 19-yard touch down. Erb was barely able to make the catch on the far sideline as he kept one foot in bounds while fall ing out of the end zone. The drive was highlighted by a 14-yard first down pass from Hat ajik to Marc Harrison '92, and a 12-yard quarterback scramble by Hatajik. The touchdown put the Bison into a commanding 17-0 lead. But the lead was short lived as Columbia stormed right back on its next possession. Following the kickoff, the Lions drove 66 yards in eight plays, culminating in an 11- yard touchdown run up the middle by Greg Abbruzzese on a draw play. Columbia received the ball again after Bucknell was forced to punt, and the Lions moved 64 yards in ten plays, highlighted by seven consecutive complete passes. The drive ended with a 39-yard field goal by Boccafola as the time ran out in the half. As the teams entered the locker room the score stood Bucknell 17, Columbia 10. Coach Maranzana felt the Lions earned their way back into the contest. ""It was not a letdown by us. I give them credit for coming after us. We were not as good at stopping them in the second quar ter. That put the game on the ropes."" After allowing the Lions back into the game, Bucknell just as quickly slammed the door follow ing halftime advice from Maran zana. The coach said, ""I told them to try harder. The situation was a test for the team. It was a measure of our self-confidence and our determination. We needed to respond."" The offense did just that, tak ing the kickoff and running the ball ten straight times. The Bison cov- Columbia got the ball back, but on its third play Trevor Smith '91 made a diving interception on a low-thrown ball. After the turnover Hatajik connected with Erb on a post pattern for a 52-yard touch down, making the score 31-10. Columbia battled back, how ever, and on its next possession the Lions controlled the ball for over three minutes before scoring on a two-yard carry by Abbruzzese. Columbia attempted the two-point conversion but failed, leaving the score at 31-16. After each team was forced to punt, Bucknell looked to its run ning game. With ball control and time-killing in mind, the Bison drove 58 yards converting on a four-yard pass play from Hatajik to Dan Scocca '91 with 11:24 left to play for Hatajik's fourth touch down of the afternoon. Bucknell increased its lead again as back-up quarterback Scott Mitchell '94 led a 21-yard drive to set up a 37-yard field goal by Krutchkoff, finishing the scoring at 41-16. Tomorrow the Bison will travel to Ithaca, New York, to take on Cornell University in a non conference matchup where Buck- ncll will face its second Ivy League opponent in as many weeks. Maranzana notes, ""Cornell is the best team we've played yet. They did everything they wanted against Princeton. They were win ning against Colgate until Colgate came up on them and squashed them in the second half."" The final score of that game was Colgate 59, Cornell 24. Buck nell will look to take advantage of the momentum generated by its two-game winning streak. Last sea son Bucknell was defeated by Cor nell in Lewisburg, 20-9. Peter Ho/The Bucknellian three receptions for 43 yards on the afternoon, as Pape has turned out to be another fine receiver for a team that also features extraordinary wide-outs Lester Erb '91 and Dan Scocca '91. Jeff Pape '92 out-leaps two Columbia defenders to haul in a recep tion. Pape's nine-yard touchdown culminated a 72-yard drive, giving Bucknell a 24-10 lead in the third quarter. The tight end finished with back Scott Auchcnbach rewrite the Bison record books. Now the time has come for Hatajik to come in and shine, which is exactly what he did last Saturday, leading Bucknell to a 41-16 thrashing of Columbia at Christy Mathewson Memorial Sta dium. The Bison look to improve on their 2-1 record tomorrow, as they face the Big Red of Cornell. Hatajik, who hit on 18 of 21 passes for 244 yards and four touchdowns against Columbia, broke the Bucknell record for com pletion percentage (.857), and tied the school record for touchdown passes in a game (four). Hatajik was named Patriot League Offen sive Player of the Week for his efforts. Bucknell's passing attack was combined with a steady ground game. The Bison rushing attack gained 200 yards, and was led by Brian Henesey '92, who scampered for 82 yards on 19 carries. Bucknell came out strong to begin the game, as John Spatafore '92 intercepted a third down pass on Columbia's second possession. The Bison took possession on Columbia's 23-yard line. Two plays later, Hatajik rolled right and connected with Dennis Bames '91 on the five-yard line. Bames took a vicious hit and had to be taken off the field. The early prognosis indicates that Bames' injury will require surgery that would force him to miss the remainder of the season. Coach Lou Maranzana com mented, ""His loss will have a sub stantial impact on the team. We will miss him as a player. He caught a lot of passes for us and blocked well."" On the ensuing play, Matt Walsh '93 took the hand-off and swept right five yards for the score to put the Bison up 7-0. Following a successful defen sive stand, the offense again took over on their own 47-yard line. They quickly marched up the field with a good mixture of three passes and three runs until Hatajik con nected with Jeff Pape '92, who had found a gap in the zone, down to the Columbia ten-yard line. They were unable to get the ball into the end zone, and had to settle for a 22-yard field goal by Todd Krutchkoff '91 with 1:11 left to play in the first quarter. Bucknell received the foot ball early in the second quarter By Scott Brown Staff Writer Todd Hatajik '91 has stood on the sidelines the last three years watching former Bucknell quarter- Peter Ho/The Bucknellian Todd Hatajik '91 is second in Division I-AA passing efficiency. Peter Ho/The Bucknellian Brian Henesey '92 bulls his way through the heart of the Columbia defense. Henesey finished the day with 82 yards on 19 carries while leading the Bison ground game, which rushed for 200 yards on the afternoon. C. Bridgewater/The Bucknellian Ken Gulick '91, with three goals this season, leads the Bison in scoring. By Chad Bown Staff Writer The men's soccer team upped its record to 6-1 by adding two more wins this week with victories over Holy Cross and Millersville. The Bison concluded their four-game road trip at Worcester, Massachusetts last Saturday. Buck- nell's Alex Kogan '94 and Dan D'Angelo '92 opened the Bison's scoring in the first half, propelling Bucknell out to a 2-0 lead just 20 minutes into the game. Holy Cross' Sean Casey cut the deficit to 2-1 with a goal off a direct kick at 37:00, but the Bison midfielder Terry Pelino '91 quickly countered with a score of his own to restore the lead to two goals heading into halftime. ""We had an excellent first half where we started off really strong,"" said Coach Reynolds. 'The super-turf is a tough surface to play on, but we made a few changes in the lineup and had good intensity in controlling the pace of the half."" However, Holy Cross came out with some pressure of their own in the second half and controlled play before Casey scored off another direct kick. With just under ten minutes remaining, he had cut the Bison's lead to 3-2. But the Bucknell defense came through under pressure and managed to hang on for the narrow victory. ""We just came out flat in the second half,"" said Reynolds. ""We were outplayed, yet we were lucky that Holy Cross couldn't capitalize on more of our mistakes. It was a good victory, and I'm pleased with the win. I'm just disappointed in our performance throughout the second half."" Tuesday night found the Mil lersville Mauraders playing before an estimated crowd of 750 at West Field, which was a much needed stop at home for the road-weary Bison. Ken Gulick '91 scored the first Bison goal on a well executed header off of a crossing pass from Jon Mackenzie '93 at the 16:00 mark of the first half. At 5-6 and 142, Mackenzie used his speed and determination in a gutsy perfor mance throughout the game. He sparked Bucknell with a goal of his own with just over six minutes left in the first half to extend the lead. Mackenzie and Gulick used their talents in creating havoc for the Millersville defenders through out the evening. Bucknell displayed a solid defense in the second half, and goalie Mark Wrigley '94 made a couple of fine saves to preserve the 2-0 win. 'The key to tonight was that we came out strong and attacked in the first half,"" said tri-captain Terry Pelino '91, who played adeptly in controlling the midfield all game. ""We've had trouble in the second half of many games this season, but we played consistently for the entire game and had a solid 90- minute effort tonight"" ""We knew Millersville would play a solid game, and we knew it wouldn't be easy."" stated a more contented Reynolds. ""I'm pleased with our defensive performance and the play of our [fulljbacks. We attacked well offensively keeping the ball wide, and we got some good crosses."" Bucknell plays a tough con test tomorrow at home against Col gate, whom they lost to 3-0 last year. ""They play hard and steady and take advantage of their oppo nents' mistakes,"" said Reynolds. ""We need to come out and play alertly and enthusiastically and be ready for a close game."" Bucknell is now 6-1 and into the depth of their schedule, which includes important matchups with many of the other contenders in the newly established Patriot League. Tomorrow's contest should be a good prediction on how the Bison will fare against some of their new rivals."
Alcohol policy modified,
Improvements mode to group sanctions,
Soccer team goes to 7-2,"Colin Bridgewater/The Bucknelllan Tri-captain Brandon Poe '91 clears the ball from the Bison's defensive end during a 2-0 loss to Colgate Saturday. See page 14. ______________________________________________________ By Andrew Cohen Staff Writer Recent student concern has resulted in progressive changes in the group sanctions section of the new Alcohol Policy, according to Mike Dominguez '91, president of the Interfratemity Council (IFC). Dominguez explained that increasing discontent among stu dents and low morale in fraternity houses prompted him to seek changes in the treatment of groups By Natalie Dunlap Staff Writer Eleven members of the Board of Trustees held an ""Access Day"" today for all members of the Bucknell University community. This program, initiated by Board Chairman Lee Idleman, marks the first of its kind and will take place again next semester on April 12. Today's Access Day was designed to give members of the faculty, support staff, administra tors, and students an opportunity to meet individually or in groups with board members. Any topic ranging from personal interests to departmental concerns and univer sity policies could be brought to the attention of the board members and discussed with them. Idleman explained that the board wanted ""to keep this [Access Day] open-ended. We leave it to members of the campus community to set the agenda. We want to hear what you have to say."" In addition to providing members of the community a chance to voice concerns and per spectives, Access Day also gave board representatives an opportu nity to meet with and get to know more personally various members under the policy. ""The administra tion was getting a lot of negative feedback from the students as to how the alcohol policy and security and safety has been dealing with enforcing the alcohol policy. So I and others in the executive council went in to speak with Dean of Stu dents John Dunlop on several occa sions about how several parts of the alcohol policy were inequitable and put IFC in a position of impo tence in which it could no longer determine the sanctions and would of the campus community through the informal 15 or 30 minute sessions. The eleven members of the Board of Trustees who were availa ble for meetings today from 10:00 a.m. until noon and 1:30-3:00 p.m. were Herbert Bamess, Stewart Berelson, Douglas Burt, Roy Gavert, Lee Idleman, Henry Lam bert, Ken Langone, Jim Nevels, Marilyn Parks, Jack Swanson, and Robert Streeter. Joan D'Angelo, assistant secretary to the Board of Trustees explained that everyone involved in Access Day was ""pleased with the good response of people requesting meetings."" Following the meetings today, a panel program, moderated by Idleman, was held in the Gallery Theatre of the Elaine Langone Cen ter beginning at 3:00 p.m. This part of the program was open to the entire campus community and anyone could come and go as their schedules permitted. The panel pro gram served the same purpose as the morning meetings but, in addi tion, gave board members an opportunity to address some of the concerns and perspectives brought out through the individual and small group sessions. no longer receive any part of the monetary fines which it uses for positive programs."" Dominguez explained that after the particulars of the changes were worked out between the IFC and Dunlop, a meeting was ""sched uled with Dean Dunlop, Ed Dadez, Mary Dorsey, the executive board of both Panhel and the EFC, and certain student leaders such as the president of BSG and RHA to dis cuss these matters. Dean Dunlop basically outlined the changes as we had gone over them previously."" There are four basic changes regarding the group sanctions part of the alcohol policy. First, accord ing to Dunlop, the role of peer review will be re-extended. ""The sanctions will not be mechanically applied, rather they will serve as guidelines and modifications of them can be proposed on a case by case basis."" He added that ""there would have to be mitigating and extenuating circumstances for mod ifying a particular sanction."" Dun lop will retain the right to approve or send back the peer review board's recommendation. Secondly, the IFC and Pan hel ""are working out a schedule so that half of the probation time will be able to be traded for community service for only one violation,"" according to Dominguez. Dunlop added that this ""alternative service plan was the idea of Mary Dorsey."" Thirdly, the executive coun cils of IFC and Panhel ""will sit down with the New director of security and safety to discuss things such as private vs. public, a definition of probable, or reasona ble cause, and to develop a set sys tem... so that each fraternity can expect to be treated in the same manner."" Finally, Dunlop is consider ing a proposal to distribute mone tary fines resulting from group vio lations, saying, ""IFC has been asked by me to prepare a proposal of its own [for fraternity fines]. Dunlop explained that See POLICY, page 2"
Trustee Access Day,
to be held today,
Similar day to be held April 12,
Oversight of security,
raises tough questions,"By Andrew Cohen StaffWriter The Department of Security and Safety is in the midst of what some might call a crisis in its per ceived legitimacy by students. Regardless of whether it is the fault of the administration, security, or the students themselves, recent stu dent outbursts have shown that security does not have the confi dence of the student body. Mike Dominguez '91, president of the Interfratemity Council (IFC) explained that ""student confidence in security has diminished mainly because they feel that security has been overstepping their bounds and that the alcohol policy is not being enforced equitably in residence halls andfratemities."" Much of this concern arises from the fact that students feel security has a free reign. Students are for the most part unaware of the procedures available to redress con cerns. Dominguez explained that in the Residential Life office there are grievance forms one can fill out against an RA, but that no such structure exists for security. Security is charged by the Policy and Procedure Manual for Patrol Officers with certain ethical responsibilities from the Law Enforcement Code of Ethics. Among these, is the duty ""to respect the Constitutional rights of all persons to liberty, equality and justice."" It would seem then, that there are definite limitations upon security, i.e. the same limitations that would apply to police officers. This is not the case though, as John Dunlop, dean of students, explained, the ""campus is private property, and there are certain rules and regulations and constitutional rights that cover public institutions and public officials that don't cover private property. There are things that are not binding to us because we are a private institution."" In addition to the private property argument, Barry Maxwell, vice president for administration, explained that there are other differ ences that exempt security from constitutional limitations. ""Their function is considered different that a police officer. If there's been a violation of the law, they'll contact the police. So they're really not act ing as police officers, they're acting as security officers. There's a sig nificant difference and a very impor tant distinction between a police role and a service role."" Maxwell conceded though, that in the eyes of students this distinction has become blurred with phrases such as ""secur ity busted us,"" now commonplace. Notwithstanding, security does not have any legal prohibi tions on its enforcement of univer sity policy. There is one other main area of ethics that appears in the Law Enforcement Code of Ethics. ""I will be exemplary in obeying the laws of the land and the regulations of my department."" As explained above, the laws of the land do not restrict security based on their ser vice role at a private institution. Thus, the only restrictions upon security are the regulations of the administration. The Community Living Handbook does lay out the only written restriction on security when it says that neither residential life nor security may go into private areas without ""reasonable cause."" See ACCOUNTABILITY, page 5"
Administration reacts to,
recent student petition,"By Andrew Cohen StaffWriter Discontentment on the part of students, seen in the recent petition demanding justice within the administration, has prompted administrators to respond to the state of morale in the university community. Charlotte Jacobsen Weddle, associate vice-president for student life, responded to the peti tion noting that she and President Gary Sojka (who was out of town this week) were in agreement as to the problems and possible solutions to this wave of student unrest. According to Jacobsen Wed dle, the petition was a healthy expression of student sentiment. She said, ""I think it is a very healthy thing for students to use every resource they have at their fingertips,"" though she expressed amazement and disappointment that some people had been ""shouting out windows, telling perspective students"" not to come to Bucknell. John Dunlop, dean of stu dents, explained that he has been acutely aware of the problem of lowered morale among students. ""I have been increasingly aware that morale was low and getting lower among Greeks and I understand where they're coming from and why they feel so concerned... A number of the things that bother them should concern us, and do, and I think that the fact that we are con cerned is becoming more evident."" As far as specific action by the University, Dunlop has sug gested ""items for the Council on Greek Life's agenda,"" including the problem of morale. One of these items is a meeting with leaders from IFC and Panhel, and two of the authors of the petition. Jacobsen Weddle proposed a ""think tank group on general issues, but if there's specific grie vances"" people should come forward. Jacobsen Weddle stressed that the university is not a totalitarian environment. ""It's not as though this is a repressive society."" She noted that administrators regularly meet with students on ""how to con structively build the future."" Dunlop echoed the sentiment, ""Not everything is the way they perceive, but there are some things that are worthy of our looking at hard and being concerned about."" One problem Jacobsen Wed dle found with the petition was in its clarity. ""The dilemma is, unless Colin Brldgewater/File Photo the petition is extremely clear on what the principles are, it can be very confusing for the people who receive it to know [what the princi ples are]."" She explained that it is necessary to delineate ""general ver sus specific issues."" issue of a double standard Jacobsen Weddle explained, ""I've heard rumors about this, but no one's come forward. We do need people assertive enough [to come for ward]."" According to Jacobsen Wed dle, everyone in the university Charlotte Jacobsen Weddle, associate vice president for student life, pictured earlier in the semester, said that the petition was a healthy expression of student sentiment. Jacobsen Weddle said that the specific complaints could be regis tered within the existing framework of the University. ""If it's possible that there are violations of univer sity procedure, that should be inves tigated."" When asked about the reports to someone, ""there is abso lute supervisory accountability for every administrator."" Jacobsen Weddle feels that most of the backlash is not the See REACTION, page 2"

An evening with Security on patrol,"By Lisa Hirschkorn StaffWriter Editor's Note: The following arti cle was based on the writer's experi ence in the back of a security car, and her interviews throughout the evening with Sergeant Delores Staf ford, and with Officers Alain McGoun and Jon Weaver. There was little excitement for the officers of Security and Safety on patrol Wednesday night, simply standard operating procedure. In maintaining security and safety on campus, they responded to fire alarms, provided escorts, and moni tored activities at fraternity houses. After joining Sergeant Delores Stafford and Officer Alain McGoun at 10 p.m., our evening began with a slow start. During the first hour of patrol, approximately 10:15 to 11 p.m., we made our rounds throughout campus. The car circled the golf course, fraternity row, Seventh Street, the downhill fraternities, the Weis Center, the golf course again, and repeated the rounds going at a speed of perhaps, twenty miles per hour. From the car, the officers double-checked lights of buildings, made a brief stop at the Weis Center, and contin ued on their way until a call from President Gary Sojka's house came over the radio. A fire alarm had been activated at Sojka's house, close to 11 p.m., and the pace of our eve ning momentarily took a 180 degree tum. Within a minute, the car arrived on the scene and was aided by the other security car on patrol. By 11 p.m., thc action had ended and we returned to the Office of Security because Officer McGoun was going off duty, and Officer Jon Weaver was joining us for fraternity checks. At approximatively 11:15 Sergeant Stafford and Officer Weaver began their ""monitoring role"" throughout the fraternity cir cuit. As there were no registered parties, we spent about one and one- half hours monitoring thc houses, but routine fraternity checks on weekends can occupy most of their night. According to Weaver, Secur ity generally spends from around 10 p.m. until 2 or 3 a.m. to monitor houses, and, he said, ""There have been nights when we haven't gotten to them all"" because the process is more time-consuming when Secur ity has to shuffle through crowds of students at parties. On any given night, there are three (or sometimes four) officers patrolling in separate cars but during house checks the supervisor, along with another offi cer, will team up with one car while at least one other officer patrols the rest of campus. It is standard policy for Security to monitor houses every Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday night, but spot checks occur on other nights as well. Beginning with the Univer sity-owned fraternities downtown, the checks proceeded from Sigma Alpha Epsilon to Sigma Alpha Mu and then Kappa Sigma. Unlike the other houses, their front doors had been previously locked by student security monitors, and the officers had to use their keys. Upon enter ing, the two officers went their separate ways --one downstairs, one upstairs-- and walked through hallways, basements, and most common areas. After checking each house, Stafford made notes on her fraternity list, but no charges were recorded until we reached Sammy. At Sammy, four students had been drinking in the basement when Stafford went down there but they ran away before she could get their names. Therefore, Stafford spoke with Trevor Stoyer '92, president of Sammy and explained to him the charges. When asked by Stoyer if the charge would be treated as an individual or group violation, Staf ford said ""I don't know. That's up to Residential Life to decide."" After checking FUI, the security car headed uphill to Tau Kappa Epsilon. The officers con tinued with their procedure of one person taking the downstairs com mon rooms while the other took the hallways upstairs. Yet, other than talking with students, the Security officers had few immediate priorities on their hands. Across the way, at Chi Phi, the officers did record a security violation because their front door was latched shut. The officers were unable to enter the house with their keys (Security has keys to all of the fra ternities) and had to knock on a room window to get a fraternity member to open the door. Throughout the evening, the officers responded, inside the car, to students comments that were printed in The Bucknellian last week. 'There are grey areas for Security because of judgement calls but the rules are pretty black and white,"" said Sergeant Stafford. Stafford explained, ""We have the authority and ability and we're paid to make judgement calls."" Stafford exemplified such a judgement call at Lamda Chi Alpha. While walk ing through the hallway of Lamda Chi Alpha's main floor, Stafford spotted a case of Busch sitting on a shelf of an open closet. They did not ask to see a fraternity officer but merely informed the brothers seated in the living room, and warned them about removing the beer from the closet. As the security car proceeded with its first round of monitoring all the fraternities, there were sev eral other houses which also appeared to violate the the Univer sity's alcohol policy. Upon enter ing the basement door of Sigma Phi Epsilon, thc officers immedi ately noticed six empty kegs situ ated on top of the bar area. They realized the kegs were empty after shaking each one, but the presence of a keg, empty or full, at a non- registered party is also a violation. Yet they did not ask to see an offi cer in the house. According to Stafford, Secur ity will check out a house before its scheduled party if they have ques tions concerning any information from the registration form that houses submit to Residential Life. ""We ask them where the security monitors will be, how big the party will be, or anything that we think is unclear,"" Stafford said. If the security car returns to a house later in the night and the party does not meet these demands --""...for exam ple, if the house has 10 kegs when they said they were only going to have 6,"" Stafford said-- then the house would receive a violation. Stafford explained, 'The only way to do our job if we're not going to be liable is to do it by the book. We all have our different ways of doing our job...we try to keep good relations, but it's hard to stay on their [the fraternity's] good side."" During my first hour patrol ling with Security, Officer McGoun had said, ""Students nark on other students,"" and Security must respond to their complaints. Out side Lamda Chi Alpha one evening, a student told Security there was a keg in the bathroom, but the stu dent wouldn't give her name. Staf ford said ""I couldn't get the name of the individual because that would have been an infringement on her rights."" Security claims that they often receive such anonymous com plaints and that it is their job to act on them for liability reasons. Staf ford explained that the officers have ""Log Sheets"" and ""we have to fill them out. They know when we're in there [the fraternity house] and when we come o u t"" Approaching Sigma Chi, we saw three students, apparently on lookout for Security, standing out side the front door. While pulling up to the house, the officers pre dicted that one of them would go inside when they noticed the Secur ity car, and it turned out the officer was right. The officers proceeded with their routine but after hearing neither sounds of a party nor seeing any open beers, Security moved on. Earlier that evening. Officer Alain McGoun had claimed, ""an officer would never go into a room unless another officer was being trained [if one security officer were training a new officer]. If we would do some thing that infringes on someone's rights, then it's a poor judgement call."" McGoun had also explained that when Security responds to fire alarms at fraternities, they often charge houses with alcohol viola tions. McGoun cited an incident at Delta Upsilon where Security responded to a fire alarm that went off outside the bathroom and, when Security walked by, they saw a tapped keg through the doorway. According to McGoun, ""students said that we infringed on their rights."" Stafford added, ""the door was open and bathrooms are com mon areas."" In other instances, fra ternities have left closet doors open when there are tapped kegs or cases of beer inside and Security sees the alcohol while walking through the houses on their routine checks. According to McGoun and Stafford, Security procedures are standard, and students would face harsher punishments if Lewisburg or East Buffalo Township police were to deal with fraternities; Whereas the police would issue citations immediately, McGoun explained that ""we take a name, list it on the residential hall violation sheet, and that person is sanctioned by Residential Life."" Compared to state law repercussions, both McGoun and Stafford agreed that ""two weeks [of social probation] is a small price to pay."" Stafford claimed that ""Even if students break the rules and they know they're breaking the rules they look at us as the bad guys."" She said, ""People don't have a correct vision of u s.. they think we're robots... they think we love to confiscate kegs."""

Security policies at four,
Pa. schools compared,"By David M urray StaffWriter In light of the questions being raised about our Office of Security and Safety, The Bucknellian has contacted Directors of Security and Safety at four of our ""frame of reference"" schools: Lafayette College, Swarthmore College, Dickinson University, and Gettysburg College. The policies and procedures implemented at those institutions may be contrasted with our own. On the question of entry into private student residence hall rooms, the four Directors were unanimous. All must have 'probable cause' to enter such a room, and all four compared their procedure with that of ""a regular police force."" The only exception to the 'probable cause' rule is in the event of imminent life or property damage such as a hostage situation or a fire. Two of the schools' policies further stipulate that Security must obtain a judicial search warrant prior to entering a student's res idence hall room uninvited, and at Lafayette, a ""search authorization from the Dean of Students' office"" must be obtained. At the universities surveyed which have fraternity and sorority houses on campus, the Security policy was similar. Private student rooms can not be entered without 'probable cause' or an imminent threat to life or property; however, the public areas of fraternity houses, including bar rooms, hallways, and lounges, are patroled fre quently. At Dickinson, Dick Eckenrode, the acting director of safety and security, added ""but we don't send in guys unannounced"" and the Director at Swarthmore, Owen Redgrave, mentioned ""we don't go in except by invitation, but typically we're invited to go in."" He con tinued, ""[Security and the fraternities] have a fairly open relationship."" In general, Eckenrode of Dickinson said that a student's room, whether in a residence hall or a fraternity house, should be considered ""the same as a private home"" when it comes to search and seizure. ""We don't want to just walk in the door and check on some girl,"" Eckenrode joked. Furthermore, he believes that 'probable cause' ""should be a policy everywhere."" Hugh Harris, Lafayette's director of security and safety, added that obtaining a 'search authorization' and entering a student's private room is both ""uncommon"" and ""very infirequenL"" Concerning the issues of oversight and evaluation, The Buck nellian has learned that at all four educational institutions, the direc tor of security and safety reports directly to an administrator (a vice president, a dean, a treasurer, and the head of the business office). In addition, however, three of the schools currently utilize a committee system to review the practices and policies of Security, and discus sion about forming such a committee is currently taking place at the fourth school, Gettysburg. At Swarthmore and Dickinson, security and safety committees meet regularly to evaluate the department The committees are com prised of students, faculty, and staff, and are chaired by the director of security and safety. Recommendations from those committees con cerning changes in Security's policies and practices go to the over seeing administrator for review and potential inclusion in university policy. At Lafayette, no standing committee exists, but Harris says committees are formed ""as needed"" to review problem situations. < ______________________________________________________ 4"

Chinese plane,
crash kills 120,"A hijacked Chinese airliner crashed into two jets at the airport in Canton, killing at least 120 peo ple and engulfing the aircraft in flames. The flight was hijacked on its way to Canton from Xiamen by two men demanding to be taken to Taiwan or Hong Kong. It is unclear why their demands were rejected or whether this led to the crash. The crash was the worst air disaster ever in China. Prime Min ister Li Peng flew immediately to Canton to view the site."

A copy of the Liberty Bell, a gift from the United States, rang from the Berlin city hall as the West German flag was raised over the Reichstag at the stroke of midnight. President Richard von Weiz- sachcr stated that ""in free determi nation, we would like to fulfill Ger man unity in freedom. We are aware of our responsibility for these tasks before God and people. We want to serve peace in the world and a united Europe."" After the statement, a crowd of about one million broke into singing the German national anthem. The celebrations continued with ringing churchbells and blar ing oom-pah-pah bands."

Moi seyev, chief of the Soviet general staff, said that the economic sanc tions against Iraq were working and that no military force should be used without the United Nations approval. Moiseyev asserted that pro tests and uprisings in Iraq were sap ping Saddam Hussein's support and that he cannot last much longer. The general said that ""we cannot view the resolution of any crisis like this by means of using arms, "" signaling a difference from the Bush administration, which has not ruled out an armed solution to the conflict."

in Angola,"The United States and the Soviet Union have indicated that they are willing to police a poten tial cease-fire and elections in order to end the 15-year civil war in Angola. The superpowers have a strong influence over Angola because of their support for differ ent factions. Moscow gives $800 million annually in military aid and stations 1,100 advisers in the Afri can nation. The United States pro vides $60 million in covert aid to the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA). Despite a withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban troops in the last two years, fighting drags on. Officials fear a famine in the next six months if peace is not reached. At the M edical Center Pharmacy"

Accountability,"From page 1 Although this leaves security virtu ally unregulated when it comes to public areas, it also leaves what constitutes ""reasonable cause"" open to interpretation. Ed Dadez, associate dean of residential life, has come up with the most comprehensive written def inition of reasonable cause in a let ter to the editor, March 3, 1989, The Bucknellian. In the final anal ysis Dadez conceded (hat reasonable cause ""is a judgement call which the RA is authorized to make as long as it is \  by factual information under the guidance of the professional staff."" Dadez attempted to clarify the definition with some examples: ""1) people getting sick in the hallway, 2) beer cans or plastic cups in the hallway, 3) spilled alcohol on the carpeting, 4) people staggering out of rooms, 5) sounds of drinking games, 6) large numbers of people coming and going out of a room, and 7) loud music."" But even these are not strin gent guidelines as Dadez conceded, ""Any one of these items may be enough to believe that a violation is occurring; however, wc believe that the RA will use common sense and prudent judgement..."" Dadez noted thai in some cases it might take as many as four of these factors to constitute reasonable cause. More importantly, Dadez explained that although this defini tion applied to members of the res idential life staff, he was not sure that security followed the same procedures. When asked if there was a clear definition of reasonable cause. Maxwell, who is in charge of administrative supervision of secur ity explained that ""the university to my knowledge does not have that term defined. Whether that's a term that's defined within the legal pro fession I don't know."" In fact, there is no such defi nition within the law; the legal term is ""probable cause."" Lewisburg District Attorney Graham Showalter explained that ""probable cause has to do with the minimum degree of evidence sufficient to show the defendant has committed a crime."" The criteron for making a search is probable cause which was opera tionally defined by 8howalter as ""knowledge as to specific evidence in a specific location."" Maxwell acknowledged that security does not have to follow such stringent guidelines, and that, as with residential life, ""I suspect it comes down to a judgement call."" Therefore, it appears that security has no formal restrictions, though according to Charlotte Jacobsen Weddle, vice president of student life, there is a process to redress grievances against security. Initially, complaints are to be filed with the Director of Security and Safety, and then to Maxwell if the problem is not solved. Dominguez explained that students do not see this as a legiti mate process. ""Without a set of pro cedures with something in writing, I don't believe that students would be confident that their concern would be addressed if it was handled with a meeting with the director of security."" As an intermediate step between the director and Maxwell, the Committee on Complementary Activities (CCA) could become involved. But as Rick Gateau '92 explained, ""In the past we've gone to the department head at the end of the semester to receive his report."" Gateau did express interest in increased relations with security including ""one member who will be assigned as a liaison to security..."" But on the whole, CCA is con strained by what ""President Sojka gives us to look at - for example, vandalism."" Though Gateau said he did not wish to ""pinpoint one issue,"" he does want to look into ""more coordination between residen tial life and security."" As of yet, CCA is not pre pared to oversee security and adjudi cate grievances. Addressing complaints to Maxwell seems inadequate as well since, according to Maxwell, 'The director of security reports to me. But the director provides all the guidance, direction, and first line supervision."" Maxwell's rigorous job duties demand that he be some what removed in his supervision of security. Thus, the dilemma remains. Security has no written procedural limitations concerning their con duct in public areas, and the ""rea sonable cause"" prohibition in pri vate areas has never been formally defined and is in Maxwell's words, ""a judgement call."" Administra tively, students are not aware of their options; these options, though, appear to be limited as well; students do not have confi dence in addressing problems to the Director of Security, CCA is not prepared to handle complaints, and Maxwell simply cannot provide ""first line supervision"" of security."

"Club house, golf course",
improvements m ade,"By Max Diego The Bucknell golf course and clubhouse were recently renovated at a cost of over $400,000. Visitors to the new facility will first notice renovations made to the restaurant and pro shop. The newly refur bished restaurant was reviewed in the Sept 28 issue of The Bucknellian. Changes have also been made to the appearance of the course itself, including a new fountain, a gazebo near the first tee, and a new practicegreen. Even with these improve ments, however, some students have noted that the condition of the grounds is still mediocre. Zack Vogel '93 believes that a greens- keeper is necessary to help maintain the physical condition of the course, especially the greens, bun kers, and turf. Parents and students can test out the course during the scramble tournament scheduled for next weekend."

A lot of campus rapes start here.,"Whenever there's drinking or drugs, things can get out of hand. So it's no surprise that many campus rapes involve alcohol. But you should know that under any circumstances, sex without the other persons consent is considered rape. A felony, punishable by prison. And drinking is no excuse. That's why when you party; it's good to know what your limits are. You see. a little sobering thought now can save you from a big problem later.

Local bed and breakfast,
blends hospitality with history,
II,"By Claire Davidson During the early days of America, the pineapple, that sweet, prickly covered fruit that is so com mon to us today, was a rare food and hardly found in the home. If your host offered you a pineapple the offer let you know you were a very special guest and were wel come in their home. The pineapple therefore became known as a genu ine symbol of hospitality, as a way of saying ""you are welcome here."" Charlie North, the innkeeper of the Pineapple Inn which is located in downtown Lewisburg commented on why he chose this particular name for his business. ""We want to try and make the name come out in what we do. It becomes more personal which is how it should be,"" he explained. Charlie North and his wife, Debo rah, both agree that the special aspect of a bed and breakfast com pared to a large hotel is that you are able to establish a close relation ship with your guests. The North's decision to open up this type of business was made mainly because they wanted to create an environment for their children where both parents would be around all the time. ""Our chil dren always have a mother and a father. It was the best thing for our family,"" commented Deborah North. ""I wouldn't do anything else. I opted to raise a family and I haven't regretted it at all,"" added Charlie North. Charlie North, who received a bachelor of arts from the Univer sity of Florida in hotel/restaurant administration previously worked for the Washington Hilton as the director of convention services, a very high-pressure job with unusual hours, according to both Charlie and Deborah North. Charlie's job was to set up the physical aspects of the conventions that were held at the hotel, so he was ultimately blamed if anything went wrong. In November of 1983 they moved to Danville, where Charlie North worked as the initial consul tant at the Inn at Turkey Hill in nearby Bloomsburg. In order to get a loan from Sedacog, a government agency that helps small businesses, the inn had to hire a professional in the field of hotel management: Charlie was their man. However, when he finished his work there, his family had to decide whether they would return to Washington, back to the stressful job he previ-"

The Norths felt very comfort able in the Lewisburg area, having lived in Danville, and liked the peo ple in this area, so they decided that for the benefit of their family they would start to look for places to open a bed and breakfast. Through their realtor they found the building which is now known as the Pineap ple Inn. The building was originally constructed in 1867 by Louis Palmer, who was also the original architect for Roberts Hall. It is a federal style house built in the Vic torian era, reflecting the character istics of a federal revival home in the mid-nineteenth century. On March 1, 1985, Charlie and Debo rah North opened their doors and since then the inn has become a very popular place for parents of Bucknell students to stay. The North's next task was to find furnishings for the inn. A few days after they bought the house, Charlie North was browsing in a local antique shop for various pieces of furniture. The owner of the store, an eccentric old man, took an interest in the newly formed bed and breakfast. Later that week the man visited the house and made the Norths a proposition. He would provide all the furnish ings for the upstairs and downstairs"

The Norths sold almost all of the furniture provided by the man. Soon after, however, the old man passed away and in his will he stated that the North's were able to buy all the furnishings from his estate. This is ultimately from whence their furnishings came. This once old, unlived-in house became an elegant, cozy bed and breakfast where people visiting the area could stay. What amazed me most about this bed and breakfast was the fact that the Norths take care of every aspect and detail in the running of their business. They do all of the cleaning of the bedrooms, bath rooms, lounges and the dining area. In addition, Charlie North prepares a home cooked breakfast for the guests every morning. The menu is another special characteristic of the inn. He provides homemade bread with fresh strawberry jam, farm eggs any style, Amish bacon, french toast, freshly pressed apple cider and orange juice. He also has a special selection of Walnut Acres Granolas for those who choose a no cholesterol breakfast ""We try to accommodate as many people as possible,"" commented Charlie North."
Student Profile,
Russian exchange student,
enjoys studies in U. S.,"By Susan Elolampi This year, Bucknell wel comes Pavel Usikov, its first exchange student from the Soviet Union. Pavel was bom in East Ger many and now lives in a flat in Bal ashikha, a small industrial town on the outskirts of Moscow. He lives with his father who is a senior offi cer in the Red Army, his mother, and his older brother and is the first member of his family to come to the United States. Pavel has come to Bucknell for one year to study economics, or more specifically, the U.S. eco nomic system. Like many other Soviet students, Pavel feels that the model of the Soviet economy doesn't work and is in turn looking for different ways to reform the Soviet system. In economic terms, the Soviet labor force is cheap, where one must work one day to earn the money for a pack of cigar ettes or three days to earn the money for a meal at McDonald's. Fortunately for Soviet students, they don't have to pay to continue their education as American stu dents do. Pavel attends the Moscow Plekhanov Institute of Economics. He has studied English for about three years as well as German. As he explains, until recently, the Soviet Union has been a ""locked country"" where people have had no use for foreign languages. Now the Soviet Union is being integrated into the world and students are eager to study different languages and cultures. 'The U.S. educational system is very flexible compared to that of the Soviet Union,"" explains Pavel.. For example, here at Bucknell, one may take a wide variety of courses outside of his major but in the Soviet Union, one may only take the courses which fall within the major. Pavel is also amazed with the amount of writing American students do and would recommend this to improve the Soviet educa tional system. The reading assign ments are much larger here too. Soviet students take notes at lec tures and only read their textbooks at the end of the semester when they borrow them to prepare for exams. Yet, one fault Pavel sees with the U.S. system is the lack of time to ask questions in class about the reading assignments, but notes that the willingness and availability of professors to meet with students outside of class provides extra help. Surprising to Pavel is the warm reception he has received in the U.S. In the Soviet Union, for eigners are perceived almost as ""aliens."" For example, an ""Ameri can"" is simply a label representing ""flourishing, rich, someone that may give a souvenir."" American cigarettes are popular and expen sive because they hold the ""Ameri can"" label. He makes the analogy that the U.S. is like a color televi sion with many different colors and the Soviets, in black and white, want the freedoms and benefits too. Pavel feels that living stan dards in the Soviet Union show no sign of improvement. With all of the political instability, the barrier Peter Ho/The Bucknellian Pavel Usikov is the university's first exchange student from the Soviet Union. on economic reforms is growing stronger. ""The first step,"" explains Pavel, ""is recognizing the problem."" Most striking to Pavel, is the self-confidence and independence of Americans. Most Soviets are inclined to be a part of a group. Yet, Americans still have a very good social life,"" comments Pavel. ""There is something for all."" As Pavel says, he ""may be the first, but not the last Soviet exchange student. We must all make a future together, and study together, not apart."""

Bison,"By Marc Haimes Staff Writer It's Sunday afternoon, and I'm in Bertrand Library (where else?) attempting to decipher the ""key words"" that seemed to make perfect sense when I jotted them down as notes during lec tures this week; there's some thing about taking notes that really scares me. However, I don't have too much time to think about that right now, in fact, I can barely concentrate on my work because of this idiot next to me who keeps on sniffing every 3 seconds. You know his type: he plops his books down really hard on the desk, takes a full seven minutes to crinkle papers and open and close his binder rings, then, when you finally think he has settled down to quitely do his work, he lets out a serious of sporadic sniffs so obnoxiously loud, that you can vividly picture the mucus being sucked up his nasal passage into his brain where it proceeds to harden, thus destroying any cere bral capacity for intelligent thought or politeness. A few years ago, I had the incredible luck of taking the SAT's with not one, but THREE sniffers. As the test progressed and the barrage of stereo snot sucking continued, I wrestled with an uncontrollable urge to throw down my ""Reading Com prehension"" section and blud geon the inconsiderate hypo chondriacs with my number two pencil. Today, I think a better alternative would be to move up to the top level (cutthroat sec tion) of the library and leave Mr. Deviatcd-Septum alone to relish in his phlegm. So I hide my three cans of contraband soda in my backpack and climb the five winding car peted flights, settling down at a carrel! next to a girl who looks vaguely familiar. That's right, she was in one of my classes last year and we talked at a party. Considering it was pretty crowded and the music was kind of loud, our conversation wasn't too bad, it went something like this... Me: (spotting girl) Hi! Girl: (trying to block out ""Jungle Love"" being played at 425 decibels) WHAT?!? Me: Hi, I'm in your Freshman Seminar... ""Medical Appli cations of Underwater Ditch Digging, a Feminist Perspective."" Remember? Girl: WHAT?!?!!!! Me: (putting my mouth two inches from her ear and screaming) HI!!!!! HOW ARE YOU!!!!!!!! Girl: Oh yeah! Me: WHAT?!? After that sparkling repar-"

He spent the rest of the evening flinging things around the room and puking into an orange juice container. I could have accepted this tantrum except for the fact that he inadvertently tore up my history notes and flushed them down the toilet. Actually,"
I,"guess that wasn't too big a deal because my notes weren't very good anyway. I can never understand those peo ple who sit in the front row hunched over their perfectly organized binders and hold their multi-colored dicky pens less than two inches from the paper in an effort to document every sin gle action occurring in class that could, in some remote way, effect their test grade. These people are the ones who begin writing and flipping pages frantically, before anyone has actually entered the classroom. I have in the past made an effort to make my notes more extensive, but some factor always seems to prevent me from doing it. Last year, I had one English professor who's chalkboard legi bility skills indicated a failure to complete ""Prescription Writing 101."" He also enjoyed emphasiz ing facts by pressing extra hard with the chalk, which would then make a neat noise while it split in two and went flying into the front row (hitting the kid with the multi-colored dicky pen). I was excited when I dis covered that my Geology Prof, had slightly better handwrit ing. .. except he talked really fast and made absolutely no sense. A typical lecture usually sounded something like this: Okay, Now thisisa Sedimentary stone andthis- isa Metamorphicstone andthisisa Flintstone MeetTheFlintsones therethestratified faults grouped alltogether... yet they were all alone.

Alright, enough reminisc ing about past note-taking catas trophes, time to get to work! But first I'll just say hello to that girl... ask her about her summer... Me: Hi! Remember me? How was your vacation? Girl: (sniff, sniff) WHAT?!?"

In the beginning...,"By Lisa Lipari When the football team from Lafayette challenged our boys to a game in 1883, they could hardly decline. Without a team and with out a field, these young men orga nized what was later to become a major part of Bucknell's sports pro gram. Lacking a coach, they learned the rules of the game through books and trained the twelve man team (eleven players and one substitute) in two weeks. On Thanksgiving Day, 1883, our boys and Lafayette's played the first football game in Bucknell his tory. There were no school colors, no cheerleaders, no band and no grandstand. There weren't even that many spectators. There was, however, the Bucknell spirit and the desire to prove that we could do whatever we set our minds to. By the way, we lost (59-0). Four years later, a committee was delegated to decide upon Bucknell's school colors. The com mittee members, Dr. William V. Hayes '88, Harry Kelly '88, and John Minnick '88, met in October, 1887 in the apartment of Mrs. Wil liam E. Martin. On the back of one of Mrs. Martin's chairs was a silk ribbon. It was blue and orange. The -say you have an enormous exam the next day -grab your bookbag and pre tend to be off to Bertrand -say your friend has a seri ous personal problem that you committee quickly took a liking to this color and decided that they would present these as Bucknell's official school colors. By the early 1900's Bucknell was rapidly expanding and its sports program was in full swing. As with every school, Bucknell needed a mascot. Dr. William C. Bartol thought it appropriate to have a bison, since Bucknell is located in Buffalo Valley and is close to Buffalo Creek, Buffalo Mt. Little Buffalo Creek, and Buffalo Cross Roads, all named after the herds that once roamed the area. In 1923 the bison was adopted as the official mascot, and in October, 1940 a real baby bison was pre sented to the booster club for the centennial homecoming game against, ironically enough, Lafay ette. The baby bison died the fol lowing May, and the Bucky Bison we know today soon followed. Certainly those early pioneers never dreamed of Bucknell as it is today, but they were instrumental in starting something that is an important part of Bucknell's his tory.

Open daily for lunch and dinner,"Welcome to ""Wine, Dine and well...never mind,"" a critical look at some of the better (we hope) dining establishments in the greater Lewisburg metropolitan area. Steve and Julie are in search of ""the altemative""...a place to dine when you've already experienced every entree at Rusty's, Scarlet D's and Front Street Station. The Stein Haus, located on Market St. in Sunbury, can be one of those alternatives, if you stay away from some of the seafood dishes. The atmosphere is rather geriatric, full of older people and deco rated with an extensive latticework. Although relaxing, the atmos phere was a bit too subdued* One of the bonuses of the evening was pianist Glenn Grove, who tickled the ivories for our dining and cocktail lounge entertain ment. Saturday nights feature Glenn from 7 to 10 p.m. Julie sampled the Chicken Oriental ($8.95), a dish chock full of juicy chicken medallions and stir fried veggies served up on a bed of rice. The portion was simply amazing -- too much for Julie to handle on her own. Julie complemented her Chicken Oriental with the soup, salad and bread bar ($1.50), which she found to be average. The Ched dar Cheese soup was tasty, but the salad and bread segments of the bar were limited. Steve dined on what he thought would be a tasty seafood treat barbecued shrimp served on linguini. The shrimp itself was not barbecued, but drenched in a light barbecue sauce. Steve was rather disappointed and surprised, for he had never encountered this method of preparing barbecued shrimp. Steve also went for the soup, salad and bread bar, which he found to be a nice complement to his meal. Even though Stein Haus' bar is not as extensive or appetizing as Hoss,' it did the trick. Stein Haus offers an extensive menu -- from lobstertail ($15) to tenderloin tips burgundy ($11). Stein Haus* offers a wide range of entrees that will satisfy the most finicky restaurant patron. Stein Haus is open for both lunch and dinner seven days a week. Julie and Steve give Stein Haus three bison and say check it out!"

Not so reasonable,"Remember guidelines? Yes, the very same things that students are given every time alcohol sanctions are changed, and the things that seem to appear on every other page of the Student Handbook. Did anyone ever bother to think of establishing guidelines for the Office of Security and Safety? The answer lies in the catchword ""reasonable cause"" and in the office of Vice Presi dent for Administration, Barry Maxwell. The Community Living Handbook contains the only written restriction on Security, when it comes to breaching students' rights of privacy, when it says that the Office of Security and Safety along with Residential Life can only enter private areas of residence halls and fraternity houses if they establish ""reasonable cause."" The question, then, is just what is ""reasonable cause""? After a hearty search through all of the materials that a student can get his or her hands on there seems to be no printed definition of ""reasonable cause."" In fact, Barry Maxwell said this week that ""the University, to my knowledge, does not have that term defined."" Meanwhile, Ed Dadez, associate dean of residential life, prefers to refer to a letter to the editor printed in the March 3,1989 edition of The Bucknellian as the source for the definition of ""reasonable cause."" The Administration seems to have come up with this nebulous term on its own and to suit its own purposes. According to ""frame of reference"" schools in the Commonwealth of Pennsylva nia, all university security departments strictly abide by the legally defined term ""probable cause."" Some even mocked the idea that Bucknell's Office of Security and Safety can enter private rooms without any form of warrant. Just where do we stand? With no clear, or even publicly printed, definition of ""reasonable cause"" how is anyone to know within what bounds the University and it agents can act? In order for students to be expected to obey the laws, the laws, and the definitions of terms used to enforce those laws, must be public knowledge. Likewise, if Security's enforcement of University policy is expected to be uniform, specific guidelines must be set forth for Security to follow. When is comes to the oversight of Security and Safety, it is Barry Maxwell who holds ultimate authority. Maxwell is charged with the responsibility of overseeing the actions of Security and Safety and, ostensibly, ensuring that Security does not overstep its bounds while it fulfills its role of providing for the security and safety of the University community. In the case of oversight, however, practice and written policy are painfully divergent. Maxwell clearly does not have the time, given all of his other duties, to adequately oversee the day-to-day operations of Security. Yet, there is an obvious need for an oversight body. A committee comprised of students, faculty, administrators and the Director of Security and Safety must be established to formulate the fundamental guidelines necessary for the ethical operation of Security. It is time that Bucknell took another look at the Office of Security and Safety and, more importantly, the lack of guidelines that have been set forth for them to follow. How about it?"

January term allows for learning without formality,"By Michael McGandy Last week's editorial in the Bucknellian titled ""It ain't broke; don't fix it"" concluded with the query, ""What then is the issue?"" The topic, of course, was the pro posed changes in our January pro gram suggested by the Committee on Instruction, chaired by Andrea Halpem. In this column I would like to add to this discussion and clarify just in what sense the Janu ary term is ""broke"" as the COI and others believe. The January term, as it stands presently with only a 35% partici pation rate, is simply not efficient. Students are not on campus or, if they are, are just not participating in the program; they are doing they're own thing, so to speak. A month passes without the Univer sity knowing where those students were-- if they were building their minds or destroying them--since none of their activity was accred ited. A whole month of a student's life cannot be accounted for in the Registrar's riles."
A,"disturbing predicament, you say. Well just think of the faculty loitering about without a class full of disinterested students to lecture at. Though the publishing ante was raised a couple years back, these academicians still seem to rind time to behave in all sorts of unpredictable and, again, unaccred ited ways. What better way to ensure that a delinquent faculty, many o f whom have slid back into bad habits after being tenured, remains in harness? This has all been a bit sarcas tic, but I believe the picture it sug gests is accurate. For the issue that the Bucknellian editorial could not identify is indeed efficiency and accountability. The whole tenor of the proposed changes to January program reeks of a concern for effi ciency, or making sure that the path of prosperity and proper time man agement is chosen. In many ways the COI is giving some strong mar keting advice to those unable to effectively package and market themselves. What"
I,"mean by these remarks, if most students have not caught on yet, is this: the signs of success and ability are found on paper, in how you document your activities. Seniors who are begin ning to consider interviewing and have typed up their first resume have gotten a taste of this and cer tainly will learn in their first inter view. At our age and in our posi tion--that is, without permanent and successful employment-- we must be striving, we must be seek ing to better ourselves, and we must be writing it down all the while. Remember, if it can't be documented it does not mean much. The COI wants students to be participating in a January program at least two years of the four spent here as an undergraduate. These classes or projects must yield a ""physical result;"" that is, there must be evidence of your time spent on campus. Further, the January term will be shortened to three weeks to ensure that students can get those ""good"" jobs, those ""resume build ers"" I have heard so much about. Hundreds of parents are said to have complained that, in effect, the January program as it stands now does not seem purposeful. But let us be honest--what does ""pur poseful"" mean to a parent, most parents? Rules, strictures, ""physical results,"" and a mark on the tran script. This has nothing intrinsi cally to do with education, but a great deal to do with accountability. Obviously, to the parent, ""educat ing"" is taking place during the autumn and spring terms because all of these criteria are present. At the very least it appears as if there is education taking place, and per haps that is all that matters. It is certainly all that matters in terms of appealing to the job market, and that is something most parents are quite concerned about. It is my hope that the faculty will resist equating structure with learning and admit that credits, classes, and ""physical results"" do not necessarily mean that anyone is learning--student or professor. This will require some bravery since it suggests that, for all the for mality-- rules and results-- of the autumn and spring terms, there is the possibility that there are stu dents who are not being educated. I believe that anyone who has spent some time in the academy will have to admit that this is, sadly, the case. Now, I do not wish to be mis taken as someone who rinds no value in traditional forms of educa tion or, worse yet, a Bucknell edu cation. On the whole our present system, more consistently than any other I can think of, provides ample opportunity and resources for meaningful intellectual activity to occur. Simply, it seems to me that the January term as it stands now is an ideal time for students to take a few chances and search out just what they find to be meaningful. For eight months of the year stu dents search for meaning within the"

If I might engage in a bit of pop-psychology, it has often occurred to me that the generation I am a part of fears to make mis takes. Now, if I judge the senti ments of those hundreds of parents and the COI correctly, it appears that our parents and university fear our mistakes as well-- the mistakes reflect badly on them. Rules must be made such that students cannot ""waste"" their January. But I would hold that it is more valuable to allow for mistakes to be made, than to curtail the range of choices that face students in order to prevent mistakes. Further I would challenge the notion that these unaccounted Januaries are actually without pur pose or wasteful; or at least I would put forward the possibility that required and accredited Januaries might be just as wasteful if our cri terion is learning and not documentation. Finally, these requirements proposed by the COI are antitheti cal to the spirit in which the Janu ary term was created. While not wishing to romanticize 60's cul ture, the climate at that time did seem to promote a valuing of learn ing for its own sake. In this spirit the January term was created to allow for creativity, for possibility, while fully recognizing that these valuable things necessarily began within a realm of choice and free dom. What is creative in fulfilling a requirement? What is the energy invested and the value derived? Ask the professors who teach courses that serve as lab require ments, that teach many of Buck- nell's ""intro"" courses--the answer is the following: The passion to provide the documentation, accountability, and efficiency that our would-be sui tors-- employers and graduate schools-- require should not make us forget why the January term was instituted and delude us as to what these requirements will actually achieve. We should be working to revive a climate that will encourage students to spend their Januaries at"
I,"Bucknell, in Lewisburg. I, too, would like to see more folks-- students and professors-- around in January. Yet to institute these requirements would be to approach the whole situation in a backward manner and choose-- as is too often the case at Bucknell-- form over substance."

Freshman Forum,"By Richard Polt Recently, I have noticed a lot of admissions tour groups wander ing around the campus. They stroll by me on the Quad next to Cole man and they overrun me at the bookstore in the U.C. As I pass these high school students beginning their quest for higher education, 1 am overwhelmed with a sense of pity. They are entering what could be the most confusing, tedious and hellish period of their lives. My intentions are not to dissuade any youngsters from taking this necessary and criti cal step. I simply want to share some of my college entrance stories in the hopes that fellow Bucknellians can relate. I vividly remember sitting in Freas Hall last year, clueless, wait ing for my tour of Bucknell to begin. Coming from a graduating class of 6 2 ,1 was awed by the people, buildings and way of life to which I was so foreign. I recall how embarrassing it was when the tour walked into some guy's dorm room at 8:00 a.m. Sunday morning and my mother started asking intelligent questions like, ""Do you use a bucket to carry your toiletries to the bathroom or do you just carry them in your hands?"" Toiletry transportation was number 52 on my list of important things to ask, right below number 51, which was the average Boxer shorts to 'Jockeys' ratio. Other things perturbed me as well. I'm sure that I wasn't the only kid whose father grabbed every piece of literature in sight for me to read. I expected to get a copy of the ""Student Handbook"" and a ""Freshman Profile,"" not ""Bucknell's Guide to Campus Plumbing- A to"
"Z.""","There was also a sense of hatred which I felt towards all other students in the admissions halls or on my tours. I knew they were my competition, and I wasn't going to let them show me up, under any cir cumstances. Being that I didn't know who to impress anyway, I proba bly appeared a bit foolish when I began listing my avocational inter ests to the cafeteria workers. But now it's time to stop complaining. The hard work and hours of research did have a big payoff. As a member of the Bucknell com munity, I have begun the next important step in my education. And if some wide-eyed mother asks me if I have a bucket for my toiletries, I can proudly say, ""Yes! I have a big bucket-- a big, black, plastic bucket with holes in it so the water can drain out!"" ....... O ctob er 5,"

"""Little Feat"" steps up to the microphone",
Tonight's concert features,
Representing the Mambo,"By Jon Elliot Staff W riter Known as one of the most underrated American rock and roll bands with what many call a live performance surpassed by few, Lit tle Feat will preform tonight at Davis Gym at 8 p.m. In support of their most recent release, Repre senting the Mambo (Warner Bros.), Little Feat will light up Bucknell after a highly successful solo tour this summer, as well as opening a number of shows for Jimmy Buffett. Little Feat recently regained national, and international recogni tion after their 1988 release, Let It Roll, which included such hits as ""Cajun Girl,"" ""One Clear Moment,"" as well as the title track. But it was in fact more than twenty years ago, October, 1969, for that matter, that, current members Bill Payne (keyboards, vocals) and Ritchie Hayward (drums) and ex member Roy Estrada came together under the guidance of ex-Mothers of Invention member, the late Low ell George. Originally named Country Zeke and the Freaks, a Los Angeles based psychedelic band, George soon changed the name to Little Feat due to his fear that the group would soon be labeled a country and western band because of their original name. After a year Of playing small clubs in southern California, Little Feat was sur prised with a record offer by War ner Bros, records. Little Feat, their debut album, was released in 1971 and included a handful of future hits, including the original version of George's always welcomed stage performance of ""Willin'."" Although Little Feat had a hard time reaching an American audience, their combination of Cajun, blues, country and rock gained tremendous popularity in Europe. It was not until Little Feat's second release in 1972, Sai lin' Shoes, that the group secured a foothold in the American music scene which was being forged by such bands as Jefferson Airplane, the Grateful Dead and The Doors. This 1972 release included such Feat hits as ""Cold, Cold, Cold"" and ""Tripe Face Boogie."" Unpleased by the progression with the group's first two albums, bassist Roy Estrada left the band to pursue other interests, and George recruited Kenney Gradney to replace Estrada, Paul Barrere on guitar and vocals and percussionist/ conga player Sam Clayton to give the band a new six-man sound. Dixie Chicken, Little Feat's first release as the newly formed sextet, produced what was their strongest effort to date, with such hits as ""Fat Man In the Bathtub"" as well as the title cut. Yet the group saw little success and soon after disbanded. George contributed to musical efforts by such artists as Robert Palmer and John Sabastian until Little Feat once again regrouped to release Feats Don't Fail Me Now in August, 1974. Oddly enough, this, their first truly successive album, saw major crea tive strides being taken by Payne on ""Oh Atlanta"" and Barrere's tal ent on ""Skin It Back,"" and less of an emphasis on George's individual skill. Little Feat's record of succes sive annual releases continued in 1975 with The Last Recorded Album which showed the group's continued inner strife. Payne and Barrere collaborated on a good number of the tracks, including"
General L,
Speaking,
Flatliners,
intrigues,"By Lee Guzofski Staff Writer Greetings yet again Bucknellians! It is the General once again bidding you well and wishing to offer any ""insight"" that I may (or may not) have regarding the world of cinema. Well, now that that crap is out of the way... this week I was able to see Flatliners starring Keifer Sutherland, Kevin Bacon, and Julia Roberts as brilliant, if not a tad bit deranged, med school students. Sutherland stars as the ingenius young doctor Nelson who comes up with the revolutionary idea of travelling beyond the veil of death to unlock the secrets therein. Although he's extremely intelligent, he is a few sandwiches short of a picnic... The film is a post mortem parade through the religious and philosophical theories regarding death. Deep stuff. As Nelson says when asked why he wants to do this, ""Religion's failed, philosophy's failed, it's up to physical science."" His experiment is, in a manner of speaking, a success. HOWEVER, each person brings back with them, upon revival, their sins or guilt in a physical form. Nelson says! ""Somehow we brought our sins back with us, and they're pissed."" This film was, in short, incredible. As long as one suspends disbelief for the majority of the movie, it is a stunningly well-done vis ual masterpiece which has, as another strength, myriad subtle nuances. For instance, when Julia Roberts is revived there is, scrawled on the bathroom wall the famous quote from Friedrich Neitzsche, ""God is dead."" Most impressively, the film closes with a painting of Prome theus, the mythic mortal who stole fire from the gods and gave this for bidden knowledge to man. An excellent closing statement to a movie that was largely concerned with Nelson seeking fame and fortune. In my estimation, this film was the summer's best. It was as fresh and as brilliant as a big, old lime green jello mold that your mom just made and put in the fridge. Just the thing to cure the summer dol drums. I highly recommend it: (the movie, not my mom's jell-o...)"

It wasn't until two years later, 1977, that the group finished their sixth album in seven years, Time Loves A Hero was not as critically well received in America as it was abroad and did not add much stability to the group's continued turmoil. It is at this point in Little Feat's history that the group real ized that their strength rested in the energy of their live performances. What the band decided to try was recording two live concerts, in Lon don and Maryland, and combine the two in their 1978 release of Waiting for Columbus, which ultimately became the group's only gold album. After producing the Grateful Dead's Shakedown Street in 1978, George began working on his first solo project, thus creating what many saw as the end of the Feat. Thanks, I'll Eat It Here was released in March of 1979, and a short three months later, Lowell George was found dead of an ""acci dental drug overdose"" at the age of 34. Although George devoted some time prior to his death to a future Little Feat album, he died before the band could complete their work in the studio. Released in Novem ber, 1979, Down on the Farm was completed by Payne and Barrere, with George's vocals having been recorded prior to his death. Upon it's release, Little Feat decided to call it quits, which proved, aside from a Payne supervised compila tion of Little Feat practice tracks and demos entitled Hoy Hoy, that Little Feat was no more. It was not until 1988, what amounted to nine years after the group's break-up, that Little Feat reformed in what proved to be one of their strongest efforts in their on- Courtesy of William Morris Agency Little Feat will be performing tonight in Davis Gym at 8 p.m. The concert will feature highlights from Representing the Mambo, their newly released album. and-off twenty year existence. Let It Roll put Little Feat back on the American scene, and their live per formances have lost little with respect to the days of Lowell George. With the addition of new comers Craig Fuller on vocals and guitar and Fred Tackett on guitar and mandolin, Little Feat sound as rich as ever. Fuller's vocals have an uncanny resemblance to that of the late Lowell George, and Payne and Barrere have not lost a step in their nine year hiatus. Touring in support of their most recent release. Representing the Mambo, Little Feat's appear ance at Bucknell is awaited with great anticipation. Bucknellians will undoubtedly be treated with Little Feat classics such as ""Fat Man in the Bathtub"" and ""Dixie Chicken"" as well as such new tunes as ""Representing the Mambo"" and ""Texas Twister,"" but if we're lucky we may even be treated to an always unforgettable rendition of ""Willin'."""
Shakespeare on the ranch,"By Jill Myrom By Jill Myrom How would Shakespeare react if he knew that his comedy, The Two Gentlemen of Verona, had been adapted to fit the back drop of the age of American Wild West? Incredible as it sounds, The Acting Company of Washington,"
D.C.,"has indeed significantly altered the setting, costumes, and hair styles in Shakespeare's play, for the benefit of the ""modem"" audience. Their version of the play, enacted last Friday night as a part of the Weis Center Arts Series, was filled with anachronisms that did not allow the audience to imagine it has been romantically transported back to the 16th century for three hours. Instead, we were bombarded by references to twentieth century images, such as the cowboys and Indians backdrop, which provided the setting for a great portion of the comedy. An oversized cactus domi nated one side of the stage, while a saloon-style doorway stood propped arbitrarily on the other, details which necessarily conflicted with the constant verbal references to Verona and Millen (Milan). The storyline itself rang a bell even for those who had not seen or read Two Gentlemen before, perhaps because the themes of the play were neither new or unique to this comedy. The major elements of the play included the betrayal of a friend in order to win a beautiful woman's hand, the betrayal of one's true and faithful love, the self-centered father who creates conflicts to keep the lovers from marrying, and of course, the happy resolution which leads to a double wedding, the trademark of many Shakespearean comedies. This play has been termed a ""minor"" comedy of Shakespeare's by Ben6t's Reader's Encyclopedia of Literature, perhaps due to the common nature of the plot. The Acting Company, how ever, turned this ""minor"" plot into a major success, judging from the audience's frequent outbursts of laughter. The humor of the script was indeed at the forefront of the acting; the actor's interpretation of the play showed sensitivity to the nuances of Elizabethan humor. The comedy of the play was derived primarily from the many clown characters. While the clowns held relatively minor roles in the plot, they nevertheless were the ones who prompted the main char acters into action. The presence of the clowns, who dressed in baggy polka-dotted suits, oversized plastic shoes, rode scooters and often fell with a crash off either side of the stage, reminded the audience of two things: that despite the moanings of the lovestruck gentlemen, the play was a comedy, not a tragedy, and secondly that this was not a tradi tional rendition of the script. The costumes of the clowns were contemporary portrayals of clowns, rather than Elizabethan Fools. Speed, the head clown, so to speak, introduced the most anach ronisms of all the others in the play, by whistling the theme to Gilli- gan's Island, as well as the theme to the game show Jeopardy. Speed also recited a clip of his verse in rap, caricaturing Black diction and mimicking the scraping of records against needles. This was one of the few scenes of the play which I found to be potentially offensive. Like David Letterman, Speed made fun of everyone, but I nevertheless was not convinced that a white actor attempting to do Shakespeare in rap was necessary to the progres sion of the play, since it was obvi ously a construct of the director, not of Shakespeare. On the whole, the play was lighthearted and well-conceived. The audience responded with enthusiasm, although the couple sit ting next to me did leave at inter mission, never to return. The play managed to extract itself from the 16th century, creating a ""timeless niche, says Chris Bittenbender, a member of last Friday's audience. It was the unexpected costumes (clowns posing as gangsters; Julia, the scorned love, looking like a B- 52 with her bee-hive hairdo), and the non-traditional setting which conveyed and emphasized the uni versal elements of the play, Bitten bender continued. The Acting Company's version of The Two Gentlemen took free reign of the script and used the unset boundar ies of Shakespeare's comedy to their advantage."

The field hockey team is continuing to search for the right offensive formula, as goals this season have come at a premium for the Lady Bison. By Scooter Van Kirk and Julie McCausland Staff Writers Defense is an extremely important part of team sports, and the Bucknell field hockey team has shown that it is more than capable of showcasing excellent defensive play. But offense is equally neces sary and Lady Bison have yet to find sustained attacks. In addition to not scoring many goals in nine games this season, Bucknell simply can't muster the offensive drives which consistently result in scoring opportunities. Last Saturday the Lady Bison"
Water polo sweeps,
Villanova Tourney,"By Scott Pollins Staff Writer Last weekend, Bucknell's water polo team traveled to Villa nova last weekend for an eight- team tournament featuring strong eastern squads. The Bison finished first, going undefeated in four games. Host team Villanova fin ished second, George Washington placed third, and Johns Hopkins took fourth. Bucknell's first game was against Johns Hopkins. The Bison jumped out to a commanding 11-2 lead and cruised to a 14-5 victory. Kevin Schroth '92 and Danny Brown '93 led the Bison surge by scoring 3 goals each in the first quarter. Dan Killinger '92 and Walter Kelly '92 individually added two goals as well. John Bradbury '92 played a tremendous game in goal, compiling 12 saves. In an effort to give all her players ample playing lime, Coach Lynn Kachmarick played her starting groups for the first half of the games, while she played her younger and inexperi enced players the second half. The Bison next faced Cor nell. Bucknell clearly outplayed the Big Red, winning 11-2. The Bison jumped to an 8-0 halftime bulge and never looked back. AJ. Zottola '92, Schroth, and Kelly led a balanced Bison attack in which seven players scored. John Bradbury turned in another fine game in goal, registering nine saves. After winning the first two games with relative ease, the Bison continued their excellent play by crushing George Washington 16-7. Bucknell stormed to an 11-2 half time lead. Brown led Bucknell with 4 goals. Tim Smaldone 'Gr and Zottola added 2 goals each. Win ning this game qualified the Bison for the championship game against host Villanova. Bucknell played a strong steady game and won the champi onship 11-4. Schroth again rose to the occasion by scoring 5 goals. John Ziegler '91 added 2 goals. Bradbury played his best game of the weekend. He tallied 15 saves, while holding Villanova scoreless in the all-important first and fourth quarters. Kachmarick commended her team on ""a good team perfor mance."" Many of the younger players scored their first goals of the season. Kachmarick main tained, ""We were much stronger than any of the competition."" This weekend, Bucknell will travel to Fordham University in New York City for its first week end of Mid-Atlantic League play. The Bison will face arch-rivals Slippery Rock, Fordham, Prince ton, and Queens. Kachmarick added, 'This will be a very tough and exciting weekend."" With the polo team playing as well as they are now, there is no telling how far this dedicated and intense group could go."
Cross-country fares well,
in West Virginia Classic,"By Jennifer Walsh Staff Writer The Bucknell men's and women's cross-country teams met with a fairly successful fate as they defeated the majority of their com petition at the West Virginia Classic on September 29. The women's team, which was forced to run without captain Kelly Marsh '91 due to bronchitis, ran especially well for its setback of Marsh's absence. The Lady Bison ran strong, defeating both Pittsburgh and Cleveland State, while losing to West Virginia, as the Mountaineers posted the lowest score of 19 points. Bucknell tallied 57 points, while Pittsburgh followed with 63, and Cleveland State with 114. The top five runners for the Lady Bison were Helene Wieting '91 (eighth place, 20:15), Gena Abraham '93 (tenth, 20:42), Colleen O'Mahan '91 (twelfth, 20:54), Kris tin Opdyke '93 (thirteenth, 21:00), and Kris Dearorff '93 (fourteenth, 21:07). Overall, Bucknell ran well throughout the five-kilometer race, Coach Gulden said the team had ""some much improved times"". despite the loss of Marsh and the defeat to West Virginia. ""We weren't going to beat West Virginia even if Kelly was there, but losing her made it a lot harder to beat Pitt,"" commented Gulden. Wieting agreed, ""We just tried to pull together as a team, because cross-country is generally a team sport. I think it showed we're a really tough team."" Wieting, how ever, disagreed that the improved scores were a surprise. ""We worked out a lot, and it finally began to pay off,"" she said. ""We should start per forming better now."" Gulden assessed, ""The women would've beat George Mason in the last race if we'd run as well as we just did. We ran exactly the way we wanted to run, and we were very tough in the mid dle of the race."" The only area of improvement needed in that race was, according to Gulden, ""to be more aggressive in the first mile."" The women's next meet will be the Hunter College Invitational, a race that Gulden describes as ""usually fairly competitive."" The Hunter Invitational will be held at Vancourtland Park. The Bucknell men's cross country team came out with results similar to those of the women at West Virginia, as they defeated the mountineers 35-74, yet lost to Pitt, 23-35. The top five finishers of the men's team who figured in Buck- nell's scoring were Matt Deardorff '92 (third place 25:59), Bob Kelly '92 (sixth, 26:44), Matt Loeffler '92 (seventh, 26:54), Jeff Loomis '92 (ninth, 27:01), and Norbert Berenyi '91(tenth, 27:05). Perhaps the most important factor of this race was not simply how Bucknell performed against the teams Pittsburgh and West Vir ginia, but how the team reacted to the UConn loss, ending an amazing Bison dual meet winning streak in cross-country just two weeks before the West Virginia Classic. Gulden ""The team reacted good. I don't think it hurt us to lose a meet. I think they bounced back pretty well, and they'll have to bounce back again, every two weeks [when a meet is held]."" Gulden added, ""We still need to improve in the middle; some of See CROSS-COUNTRY, page 13 faced conference foe Lafayette on the Leopard's home field, and suc cumbed in their fourth consecutive 1-0 loss. The statistics painted an accurate picture of Lafayette's strengths and Bucknell's weaknesses. The Leopards set up an excessive amount of scoring oppor tunities for themselves, (17 comers and 21 shots on goal) which pro duced the winning tally, while lim iting the Bison to a mere five shots on and three comers. ""Lafayette was very aggressive, but it was a poised aggressiveness,"" com mented Averill. ""Out of the eleven Lafayette players on the field, there were eleven players who wanted to score."" Goaltender Danielle Ward '93 played ""the game of her life"" according to both Averill and co captain Jeanette Aurand '92. Ward is now second in the Patriot league with a save percentage of .873 - up from fourth place last week. Reflecting on the tough loss, Ward commented, ""We got lucky on a lot of defensive saves. They pounded us, but we didn't give in."" Ward has made good use of last year's bench time, which was spent learning from Buckneil's all- time save record holder Maria Kee- sling '90, and has more than ade quately filled her shoes. ""Each player needs to set their own goals,"" said Coach Ave rill. ""There are personal goals as well as team goals, and both are required for a successful team."" Averill wants to increase the num ber of shots and thus, the goals will follow. Averill has several things she wants to work on with the team, with consistency being a primary issue. ""We've had scoring opportu nities, no problem. I want more elbow grease on the shots -- I mean really cracking the ball."" Averill also plans to ""do some net working"" on offensive comers. Most importandy, Averill feels that building self-confidence in her individual players is para mount to having her team play as one whole unit. The Cornell game played yesterday at Cornell's home field occurred too late to be included in this article. As of Tuesday, the Big Red were 2-4-1 overall and 1-2 in the Ivy League. Cornell's loss to Lafayette by a score of 4-0 has heartened the Bison, who look to take advantage of the fast-playing turf and outpace the Big Red. This weekend the Bison face Patriot league arch-rival Lehigh on Saturday at noon and non conference opponent LaSalle on Sunday at 1p.m., each at Lewisburg. Lehigh is struggling this year, and Averill fully expects a well- matched game against the Engi neers. LaSalle is 2-5-1 this season, and has recendy lost to Lafayette 5- 0. The Bison will be looking to avenge last year's 1-0 loss to the Explorers. Editor's note: The Lady Bison traveled to Cornell yesterday evening for a clash with the Red Raiders.

Volleyball drops first two,
Patriot League matches,"By Todd Bianchine Staff Writer The Bucknell volleyball team started its Patriot League play on a down note last weekend, losing to Army and Colgate at West Point. Army handed the Lady Bison their first league loss, as the Lady Cadets played impressively in winning in impressive fashion 15-4, 15-2, 15- 8, moving their record to 11-3 Spruce (2-0 in the Patriot League). Colgate capitalized on Buck- nell's day of struggle by also defeating the Lady Bison in three straight games, 15-7, 15-4, 15-2. The Red Raiders increased their record to 9-3 (1-1). With the two losses, Bucknell fell to 2-9 (0-2) for the season. 'The level of play in the league is much higher than what we had earlier in the season,"" said set- ter/outside hitter Mary Jordan '93, ""there was an extra pressure that hasn't been there before."" Army, led by Patriot League Player-of-the-Week B.J. Martin '92, had no problem in handling Buck- nell's new 6-2 offense, as they only gave up 14 points in the entire match. Even though Bucknell was dominated, there were positive things that came from the match. The most significant was the aggressive play of Colleen Conway '94, who had three kills and had a .250 hitting percentage for the match. ""Colleen did some great things for us coming off the bench,"" said Coach Cindy Opalski. ""She didn't play intimidated at all and she played real aggressively when she was in the game. I said earlier in the season that she improves each time she steps on to the floor, and this a great indication of that."" ""I really wasn't expecting to go in,"" said Conway. ""When I went in I was really nervous, so I just tried to do everything I was taught and I hoped it would work, I guess I was on."" Colgate caught Bucknell off guard in the second match, as they took advantage of Army's stinging victory over the Lady Bison earlier in the day. The Red Raiders, who posses great defensive players, (3 out of the top 5 dig leaders in the conference) were able to hold Bucknell to just 13 points in the match. Kathleen Sullivan '92 led all Bucknell scorers with 5 kills and 1 block, while Meg Kinney '92 came in and put down 4 kills and hit .300 for the match. ""Army by far is the best team we have seen in terms of size, intensity, quickness and depth, and we played a little bit timid,"" said Opalski. And when it came time to play Colgate I think we still had a little bit of the Army game in us, so we weren't at our best."" ""I think one of the most sig nificant things this weekend is we know we played the best two teams in the conference,"" continued Opal ski, ""When you go into games like these you can take one of two roots. First there is the negative approach when you can go into the game thinking that there is no way you can win and think you're no good, or you do what we did this weekend and play determined and within your skill level. If anything it has made me more determined and I hope I can convey that feel ing to the team."" The Lady Bison will look to improve their record on the road tomorrow, as they travel to Seton Hall to face the Pirates in a non league match. Bucknell will also face Ivy League rival Columbia, as the Lady Bison hope to tack on some wins to their 2-9 start."
Tennis wins three,"By Christopher Mosunic Staff Writer The Bucknell women's tennis team had a terrific past week. The Lady Bison went undefeated in three matches against Saint Francis, Franklin & Marshall, and Delaware. Coach Rose Ewan reached a milestone in her career by winning her 100th match against Delaware, as the Lady Bison defeated the Blue Hens Saturday 5-4. The competition was extremely tough. Kymm Carlson '94, Karen Stagliano '92, Stepha nie Ryer '91, and Jennifer Wyckoff '92 all took their matches in three sets. Elizabeth Murphy '94 com mented, ""This was one of the most exciting matches of the year. It came really close, but Kymm and Kim pulled off a doubles win that took us for the win."" The most exciting victory of the day came from Ryer. She played hard but Sherry Haideri of Delaware just scraped by to win the first set 7-5. Ryer rebounded to win the second set by the same 7-5. The third set turned out to be a bam-bumer. With endless vol leys and many heart-stomping shots at each other, until the ladies reached a tiebreaker, which Ryer won 10-8. Though Bucknell's singles players played well, the squad's doubles teams struggled. Mary Ann Benack '92 and Stagli ano were shut down by the strong Delaware doubles team of Tara Finnegan and Katherine Adams. Finnegan also beat Benack for a Blue Hen singles win. Carlson and Thompson then won their doubles match easily 6-3, See TENNIS, page 13 page 12 The Bucknellian October 5. 1990"

The game was marred by many penalties resulting in one red card, five yellow cards, and one penalty kick. From page 14 in their own end area giving the Bison a chance to tie the score with a penalty kick. Kirk Lone '91 took the kick and blasted a shot that hit off the crossbar and bounced back to the Bison leaving them with another point blank attempt on goal. But this shot also missed, striking Col gate keeper Gonzalo Bcarman directly in the chest, wasting another golden opportunity. Bucknell could not manage to keep the pressure on, and had only one other legitimate attempt at scoring when a Gulick header found its way past Colgate's Bear- man but went just wide of the net. Alex Roe finished off the game for Colgate by adding an insurance goal past second-half keeper Mark Wrigley '94 with just over 13 minutes remaining, dimin ishing any hopes the Bison had of a comeback. ""We just didn't come out the way we could today."" said a down cast Terry Pelino '91. ""Our heads weren't into it, and we paid the price for it."" ""We showed a definite lack of poise and composure in the sec ond half,"" continued Reynolds. ""It wasn't a horrible game, it was just one of those days."" The team continued their sea son with a contest last Tuesday at Bloomsburg. Bucknell controlled play for most of the first half, but found themselves down 1-0 when a low percentage shot from Tom Jer- amcz found its way past Racek into the upper left-hand comer of the Bison net. Bucknell showed signs of becoming flustered, before recover ing with a score of their own five minutes later. Gulick penetrated the Bloomsburg defense and launched a crossing pass which Jon Macken zie '93 promptly headed into the net. From that point on Bucknell controlled play, but just couldn't manage to capitalize. Finally, after continuously knocking on the door throughout the second half, Buck nell added another goal when Gulick again beat the defense and scored with ten minutes remaining in the contest The final result was a 2-1 Bison victory, and a sigh of relief from both the coaching staff and players. ""It wasn't as close a game as the score might indicate,"" said Reynolds. ""We had good penetra tion throughout the second half, and if weren't for a bit of bad luck, the score could have just as easily been 4-1."" The team continues play tomorrow as it hosts Patriot league foe Army, and then plays former"
ECC,"rival Towson State on Tuesday. When asked to comment on the Army squad, Reynolds said,""We've never played them before, but I have a feeling they'll be deep, talented, and very aggressive. As for Towson State, they've got a lot of players back from their conference championship team of last year. They've got the person nel, and we're going to need a tough performance to beat them."" Bucknell is now 2-1 in the Patriot League and 7-2 overall. The Bison need two solid performances this week if they wish to keep their hopes of post-season play alive."
Lady Bison,"From page 14 thing we could possibly do we did right We just couldn't find the back of the net."" Lovecchio continued, ""We were stringing together passes, and getting shots which was nice to see. Defensively, except for two or three lapses, I thought we played pretty well."" Unfortunately one of these lapses allowed a goal in the second half when Gettysburg got a breaka way as the Bullets made a good transition moving the ball from their defenders to their strikers. Kati Michalsky got past the Buck nell defense and made a shot from 18 yards out to score at 57:49. The break for the Lady Bison came when Stephanie Por- caro '93 made a run from her sweeper position, dribbled into Get tysburg's penalty box, and was taken down by one of the defend ers. The resulting foul led to a pen alty kick for forward Kathy Ott '91. On Ott's first kick, the Bullet goalkeeper Tiffany Bridges moved too soon giving Ott a second oppor tunity. This doubled the pressure on Ott, but she scored on the following shot, a beautiful goal to cut the lead in half at 83:52. The Lady Bison kept the pressure on, playing well both offensively and defensively, but were unable to score again. Goal keeper Bridget Collins played the entire game, compiling thirteen saves. ""We had some excellent opportunities to score,"" said Lovec-"

We got it together in the second half, and if we'd had more time we would have gotten another goal. We always start out flat and then we get going."" Krause agreed, ""We start the game out slow, we let them get a quick goal and then we finally start playing. We came out well after halftime but then we were unlucky,"" she said. ""It's pretty frus trating, actually. We just seem to be a second half team."" Even Lovecchio commented that ""we usually play teams better in the second half...it was a game we could have won. They weren't any better than us or any worse."" There are some things the team hopes to improve on before its game tomorrow at Temple. Smith said that the team has to work on marking and talking, but assured, ""We'll play well against Temple."" Krause is looking forward to the game as well; she feels that the primary aspect the team needs to work on is to be ready at the begin ning of the game. Lovecchio thinks that the Lady Bison have to try to take more shots. ""We must shoot to score,"" he stressed. ""We've just got to play for ninety minutes, and be intense and aggressive for the entire game."" Lovecchio feels that being able to play intense for the com plete game will make everything else fall into place. Tomorrow's game with the Owls will be tough, but the Lady Bison are optimistic that it will produce another victory.

Football,"From page 14 Cornell took the Bucknell punt, which was downed on the Big Red's own 1-yard line. A few playa later, Higgins picked off his third pass of the season. The Bison took the ball the 30 yards, ending with a ene-yard sneak by Hatajik up the middle to make the score 28-14. The drive was highlighted by a 14- yard completion from Hatajik to Scocca to the Cornell three-yard line. Bucknell increased its lead to 35-14 on its next drive. After stop ping a Cornell fake punt attempt, the Bison took over the ball on the Cornell's 41-yard line and scored just five plays later when Cavlovic hauled in a nine-yard Hatajik pass for his third touchdown of the day. The score was set up by two earlier passes to tight end Jeff Pape '92, of 20 and 14 yards, respectively. Already leading 35-21, Buck nell got the ball back for the final score of the game midway into the fourth quarter. The drive, which ate up over five minutes of the clock, was mainly on the ground. The touchdown, a 28-yard run by Hene- sey, was scored on a fourth down conversion. The extra point by Todd Krutchkoff '91 was his fif teenth in a row. Bucknell hosts Towson State tomorrow at 1 p.m. Last year, the Tigers beat the Bison 29-23, but Towson State is struggling of late, coming off a 42-0 loss last week to Indiana U. (PA). ""Last year, they only won two games and one of them was against us. I'm always wary of them. They have plenty of talent,"" Henesey said. Coach Maranzana also stated the Tigers ""were 0-4 when we played them last year. It was the << same scenario. They have some really good skill people. They're pretty good. The four teams they have played are better than any of the teams we have played so far."" Towson State most often looks to tailback Robbie Jackson who leads the team in rushing, receiving, and scoring. Also, the Bison must watch out for sopho more Jarrett Grier, who in his colle giate debut, rushed for 111 yards last week. A Bucknell win would increase their winning streak to four games, the team's longest since 1978."

Susquehanna Tourney,
surprises golf team,"By Jamie Diaferia Staff Writer The golf team finished twelfth in a twenty-two team field last Friday in the Susquehanna Tournament. The invitational held in Hazleton, PA, was somewhat of a setback for Bucknell, as the team turned in relatively high scores in a fairly uncompetitive field. Coach Thompson did not express concern over' the results, however, despite the fact that the ECAC qualifier is rapidly approach ing (Oct. 4). He feels that the tour nament was not an accurate repre sentation of the team, as only two of his regular five players participated. The squad entered the Sus quehanna Tournament last week with a largely revamped team and an entirely new set of expectations. Thompson tried a new team which consisted of regulars Scott Miller '93, and Don Hansen '94, and the first-time players Glenn Hertzberg '92, Chris Curti '94, and Howie Livingston '93. According to Thompson, ""The purpose in the change was to see a new set of players, and how they would react to the pressures of a tournament."" As a result, the scores were the highest yet for the young team. Livingston led Bucknell, shooting an 83. Miller, Hertzberg, and Curti followed with an 84, 85, and 87, respectively. Most surpris ing was Hansen's 90 for the day, an uncharacteristically high score for the usually steady player. While the scores were high for the team, the players are not concerned. ""The team just wanted to make sure we eradicated all of our lackluster play before the ECAC qualifier on Thursday,"" said Han sen. ""I obviously took care of that myself."" Miller added, ""We can play better. We just weren't mentally into (the tournament) as much as we should have been. We have a decent shot at qualifying for the ECAC."" Coach Thompson agreed, ""We didn't play very well."" The field of teams was less competitive than others in the past, leaving open the possibility of the Bison finishing in the top five, had they broken 320 for the top four players. In the ECAC qualifier, Buck nell will be facing many of the same teams that they will see in the spring. For this reason, the ECAC tournament can be considered an indication of how the golfers will fare against others in the spring. The tournament will be held on the same course as the F&M tourna ment, where the Bison played its first tournament this season. Thompson feels this will be a defi nite advantage to  them, as the team already has a feel for the conditions. One of Bucknell's team goals is to beat Lehigh, one of the tougher squads playing at ECAC's. With a score of 320 or better, Thompson is confident that his team can break the top ten and the players can achieve they goal. The team will face several of the same schools that they will see at the ECAC qualifier when they play in the Norstar Bank classic, scheduled for Monday. Thompson has a great deal of confidence going into both the ECAC qualifier and the Norstar Classic, predicting, ""We will be ready."""

"Football rolls over Cornell, 42-21",
Bison annihilate second straight Ivy League foe,
",",
improve record to 3-1,"Peter Ho/The Bucknellian With great protection from fullback Craig Cavlovic '92, quarterback Todd Hatajik '91 looks downfield for an open receiver. By Scott Brown Staff Writer Led by the powerful running of Brian Henesey '92, the Bison football team rolled to its third straight victory with a 42-21 trouncing of Cornell last Saturday. The win ran Bucknell's record to 3- 1, its best start since 1981. The key to the game was Bucknell's strong offensive attack. The Bison amassed 425 total yards, including 250 on the ground. Hene sey led all rushers with 159 yards on 26 carries. This placed him eighth overall on the Bucknell all- time rushing list. Henesey hopes to continue his current success, as he is averaging over 100 yards a game. ""It's every running back's dream to have a 1,000 yard sea son,"" said Henesey. ""That is my goal this season but it sure will be tough to keep up this pace."" Quarterback Todd Hatajik '91 had another sensational week, throwing for 175 yards on 14 of 18 passing. In his last two games, Hat ajik has completed 32 of 39 attempts. As they have done in the three previous games, Bucknell scored first, taking the early advan tage. On its first series the team drove 76 yards on 11 plays to take a 7-0 lead. On the drive the Bison m m m r * . i n | accumulated four first downs, including a conversion of a third- and-twenty from Cornell's 37-yard line. A 23-yard completion from Hatajik to Dan Scocca '91 kept the drive alive. The touchdown was scored by Craig Cavlovic '91 on a one-yard plunge, his first score since 1987. Bucknell got the ball back three plays later after Mike Augs- berger '91 recovered a Cornell fumble on the Cornell 48. Bucknell drove the field 52 yards in 5.27 cul minating with another one-yard run by Cavlovic for the score. The 12 play drive consisted of 11 rushing plays, constituting 49 of the 52 yards. The first quarter ended with Bucknell holding a commanding 14-0 lead, primarily due to the strong rushing attack. The Bison had 128 total yards for the quarter, 94 of which were on the ground. For the season the Bison have won when they have rushed the ball well. In this three-game winning streak, the offense has rushed for at least 200 yards in each contest. Henesey stressed the impor tance of the running game by stat ing, ""It opens up the passing game. It is important to run. The running and passing games complement each other."" Coach Lou Maranzana agreed, ""The running game abso lutely correlates to winning. We have to run to get everything else to work. It keeps people away from being down our throats so that we can pass the ball. It offers us some zone situations to go against. The running allows us to possess the ball and keeps our opponents off the field. At worst, if we run well we can punt the ball down field to set up our defense with good field position."" After neither team could con vert on their initial possession of the second quarter the ball went back to Cornell. They drove 67 yards on nine plays to cut the mar gin to 14-7 finishing with a five- yard rush off left tackle by Scott Oliaro, 1989 Ivy League Sopho more of the Year. Bucknell didn't falter though, as they drove right back into the end zone on its next possession to again post a two-touchdown advan tage. The drive, which began at its own 25-yard line, ended with a seven yard scramble around the right side by Hatajik. This drive, unlike the previous two scoring drives, was mainly done through the air. Hatajik connected on all four of his passing attempts for 58 yards, including completions of 16 and 18 yards to Lester Erb '91. With just over three minutes left to play in the half, Cornell took the kickoff and marched from their own 37 to the Bucknell eight yard line with the help of some careless mistakes by the Bucknell defense. Twice, the Bison defense was nailed with personal fouls, account ing for 24 extra yards on the Cor nell attack, as well as stopping the clock for the Big Red as time was running out With a first down on the eight-yard line, Cornell attempted three straight runs but were denied each time, the final two tackles coming from Corey Castellani '94, who led the Bison with ten tackles for the day. Cornell called a time-out to discuss whether to attempt a 17- yard field goal or go for the fourth down conversion with only 31 sec onds left to play in the half. They decided to go for the touchdown, and the move proved effective as Oliaro scored his second touch down of the game making over left end to bring the the halftime score to 21-14. Coach Maranzana was not pleased with the way the half ended, stating ""They had a 50-yard drive and we gave them 30 yards of it. It was really dumb. Mike Augs- berger was trying to strip the ball as the runner was held up, and (Bill) Higgins '91 raised his leg to protect himself from someone stepping on him but it looked like we were retaliating. We just can't have that happen."" The second half started with an unsuccessful drive by the Bison. See FOOTBALL, page 13 Peter Ho/The Bucknellian Brian Henesey '92, shown in a game played earlier this season, led the Bison rushing attack Saturday against Cornell with 159 yards on 26 carries. His 28-yard touchdown run on 4th-and-l in the final quarter sealed the victory for Bucknell."

Women's soccer drops record to 1 -4,
after 2-1 setback to Gettysburg,"By Anne Taback Staff Writer Tuesday the women's soccer team suffered a disappointing 2-1 loss at home against the Gettysburg Bullets. The record of the Lady Bison now stands at 1-4 after notching their victory last week against Wilkes. The first goal for the Bullets came at 31:50 in the first half, when Gettysburg forward Emily Brown was able to score off an assist by teammate Heather Shenefiel. The Lady Bison came close to tying the game when forward Amy Krause '91 shot a direct kick which hit the inside of the post and bounced out, but there was no one there to follow it up before a Bullet defense player took control of the ball. According to head coach Toby Lovecchio, ""We were very fiat in the first twenty five minutes. There was no movement off the ball, we weren't playing good man- to-man defense. The whole team wasn't playing man-to-man defense and that's how they scored their first goal."" But after halftime the Lady Bison picked up the pace. They took good control of the ball and began to put pressure on the Bul lets; consequently, Bucknell took a lot of shots and kept the ball in the Gettysburg half of the field. Every thing was working for the Lady Bison, except for putting the ball in the Gettysburg net. ""In the second half, we had the ball in their end for twenty minutes,"" said Lovecchio. ""Every- See LADY BISON, page 12 By Chad Bown Staff Writer The Colgate men's soccer team was not intimidated by Buck nell's 6-1 record, as it took advan tage of some cosdy Bison mistakes and left Lewisburg with a 2-0 vic tory last Saturday. Game day weather was over cast and the field was noticeably wet, thus contributing to the game's sloppy play. The contest was filled with many penalties, which resulted in one red card, five yel low cards, one penalty kick, and numerous minor injuries. The Bison came out slow in the first half both offensively and defensively, and the Red Raiders took the instant advantage. Colgate capitalized on a miscommunication between the Bucknell defense and goalie Scott Racek '91 at 5:49 of the first half. Colegate's Scott Cole man got a foot on a loose ball in front of the Bucknell net for a quick tally past Racek and an early 1-0 Red Raider lead. To make mat ters worse, the Bison lost their lead ing scorer Ken Gulick '91 for the remainder of the half just two min utes later when he was injured on a collision in front of the Bison net. As a result, the Bison found them selves unable to mount any offen sive pressure, and were forced into their own end for nearly the entire half. Bucknell did get a break just before halftime when Colgate's Jon Carter was ejected from the game, leaving the Red Raiders to play the remainder of the contest with only ten men on the field. ""Emotionally, we came out ready to play in the first half, "" said Coach Reynolds. ""We were just out of sync, like a record playing on the wrong speed. The first goal we just gave away because of bad commu nication, poor execution, and bad decision-making."" The Bison started the second half hoping to capitalize on their one-man advantage. Bucknell caught what seemingly looked to be the break they needed when the game referee made another suspect call just two minutes into the half. He whistled Colgate for a penalty See MEN'S SOCCER, page 12 Peter Ho/The Bucknellian Forward Amy Krause '91 sets herself for a shot at the Gettysburg goal.

Bucknell nationally,
ranked in liberal arts,"By Andrew Cohen Staff Writer Bucknell was ranked at the top of the second quartile for ""National Liberal-Arts Col leges"" finishing just out of the top twenty-five, in the October 15 issue of U.S. News & World Report. The ranking incorporated academic reputation, student selectivity, faculty resources, financial resources, student sat isfaction, SAT/ACT scores of students, acceptance rates, edu cation of faculty, student to faculty ration, total spending per student, and graduation rates. President Sojka said that he ""can't be too upset with where we are... [Because Buck nell is] in with some awfully good people."" Sojka explained that the top twenty five category is very tough to break into. ""If I look at what they call the top twenty- five in that category I honesty think probably twenty-two of them without much argument would have to be considered institutions with a little bit more going for them than we've got in terms of endowment, student to faculty ratio, the prestige of the faculty, pre-college preparation of students, selectivity... all of those things."" Sojka did express dissatis faction at the whole idea of ""rank ing colleges"" for several reasons. He has argued in the past that the idea is misleading to students who go by the rankings as opposed to finding out about schools for themselves. In past years Sojka found fault with the categorization of schools. ""When Bucknell was called the best comprehensive university east of the Mississippi [along with St. Olaf] a few years ago we objected on several grounds. 1) East of the Missis sippi says very plainly a regional institution and we feel that we qualify as a national institution... 2) We were in what they call comprehensive universities and that was an ill defined group of frankly mismatched institutions with little in common."" Now Bucknell is classified as a ""National Liberal-Arts College"" which Sojka feels puts the Uni versity ""in the right group, that is, a nationally based highly selec tive prestigious institution."" Sojka also responded to reports that the University's selectivity has gone down as evi denced by the fact that Bucknell See RANKING, page 2"
Bison plans further delayed,"By Tara G. Gilligan Staff Writer Material delays, caused by the crisis in the Persian Gulf and the threat of economic recession, have set back the completion of the Bison renovation project by approximately two weeks. The Bison, a student social center located on the bottom floor of the Langone Center, should open on Nov. 16 despite earlier indications that it would open November 1. The contractor, architect, and several administrators set the final date during a job meeting yester day. According to Mary Dorsey, acting assoc, dean of orientation and activities, the construction will end on the afternoon of November 16. During the evenings of Novem ber 16 and 17 the Bison Program ming Committee wil sponsor a grand opening celebration. Several problems attibuted to the delayed opening. 'There's any number of problems that have cropped up. I can't really point to any particular one saying this is a hold up, "" said Jim Hostetler, man ager of construction. The most pressing delay cur rently is the difficulty in obtaining materials, especially furnishings, necessary for completion. Hostetler said that vendors are weary of stocking shelves with excess mate rials because of the threat of eco nomic recession."
Middle East lecture series,
examines US role in Gulf,"By Natalie Dunlap Staff Writer The International Relations Program has been sponsoring a series of lectures examining the Persian Gulf Crisis. These weekly lectures began September 18 and will finish in November with a panel discussion. Stephen Stamos, professor of international relations, spoke on the ""Economic Aspects of the Gulf Cri sis"" Tuesday October 9. One of his main focuses was the production and consumption of oil for various countries. Through his talk, he tried to show ""our gluttonous use of petroleum"" which he determined to be 8,264 barrels of petroleum per day in the U.S. or 17 gallons per second. Another area of analysis was the global ecomony before and after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Stamos observed that ""most of the enthu siasm and euphoria for the integra tion of Western and Eastern Europe has burst because of the Persian Gulf Crisis."" Concerning a Gulf war, Sta mos believes that ""to be willing to go into a war which could sink a country into a state of depression is suicidal."" He did say, however, that if the choice is between an early war or a sustained war, he would choose an early war: ""We can't afford to make this a pro longed effort either in waiting or in a prolonged war...not with the con sequences."" Stamos' final point was the energy policy in the United States. He summarized that we have ""to stop burning fossil fuels."" He observed that ""any one carryover from the late '70s is the concentra tion on energy conservation."" He believes that this is our only hope for a sustainable future and that if the U.S. would have steadily con centrated on this issue instead of ""just renewing interest in our prob lem with fossil fuels when some thing like this [Persian Gulf Crisis] happens,"" we would not be in this position of contemplating war. In earlier lectures, both Dick Peterec, professor of geography and international relations, and Tom Travis, professor of political science and international relations and director of the International Relations Program, predicted that war is likely before the end of the year. Travis maintains, ""There is no room for compromise. A major war is coming."" The kind of war that this is likely to be and the conse quences of such a war will be dis cussed this coming Tuesday by Tansa Massoud, visiting assistant See LECTURES, page 2"
Football improves to 4-1,"Peter Ho/The Bucknellian Bison tailback Brian Henesey '92 ran through the Towson State defense last week, gaining over 115 yards while leading Bucknell to its fourth victory of the year. Henesey is on course for a remarkable 1,000-yard season. Bucknell will be featured in action tomorrow against Princeton at 1 p.m. See page 20. w i -- Si # -  - -- Nancy Leon/The Bucknellian Construction on the Bison progresses amid delays stemming from economic woes resulting from the Per sian Gulf Crisis. ""We're finding that with a recession either imminent or likely and people not knowing exactly what's going to happen in the Per sian Gulf, vendors are just ner vous...about tying up money in inventories,"" said Hostetler. As a result, contractors are finding it more difficult to attain materials. As an example of the types of delays affecting the renovation pro cess, Hostetler said that ""some of the tile that's supposed to be installed in the building is aboard a ship between Italy and Texas. This is a tile that would normally be in stock and we're attempting to expe dite the process."" Mary Dorsey, associate dean for student acitivities, discussed the effects of the Persian Gulf crisis in regards to the Bison renovations. ""Apparently the situation in the Persian Gulf is delaying some of the materials for delivery. I guess there's a demand for material from other sources that have a higher pri ority than what we have here,"" she said. Hostetler expected another shipment of materials by the end of the week. ""If we get that and the final third comes in in a week or two weeks, I think we'll be in good shape for that mid-November date,"" he said. These most recent delays have inconvenienced the Bison Pro gramming Committee, which will schedule events to be held in the newly renovated center. ""It's frus trating that they cannot give us a date because it makes our lives mis erable,"" said Steve Wolin, chair of the committee, before the decision on the completion date. The committee does have one event, a dance marathon co sponsored by Students Against Muscular Sclerosis and the Buck nell Student Government, planned for Dec. 7. That date, according to Hostetler, is fairly safe. ""I can't conceive of anything that could delay us that long,"" he said. Other delays have affected the renovations, as well. ""It was possible, at one point, that we would have had to delay this pro ject a whole year,"" said Dorsey, referring to the unexpected need to remove asbestos from the area. ""There was a delay of the start of the project this summer caused by the need to remove the spray-applied fire-proofing material which...contained asbestos,"" ex plained Barry Maxwell, vice presi dent for administration. The fire proofing contained 10-15% asbes tos and was of no threat to staff working in the building. However, the asbestos could have posed a threat to construction workers. After removing the asbestos, another type of fire-proofing had to be applied. ""The contractor did that for us, but that took a week and under any son of change, the con tractor is entided to ask for an extension to the contract,"" said See BISON, page 5"
January Plan proposal to,
be reconsidered by COI,"By Anne Ervin During a special faculty meeting Monday, the faculty sent a proposal to change the January Pro gram back to the Committee on Instruction (COI). COI's proposal included a graduation requirement for student participation, a shortening of the January term from four to three weeks, and the creation of a special council to oversee the entire program. After some discussion, a straw vote was taken to gauge the faculty's feelings on these two issues. A vast majority of the faculty members were against the proposal; thus, they decided to send it back to COI for reconsideration. This is the third time that the faculty has postponed definitive action on the January program. The first time the faculty pushed back consideration from September to their October meeting. At the Octo ber meeting the faculty began dis cussion of COI's proposals with ten minutes left in the meeting, and decided to hold this special meeting. The January program has been under scrutiny due to declin ing faculty and student involve ment. It is estimated that only thirty five percent of students par ticipate in the four week program. The faculty will again discuss the future of the Jan Plan when COI comes back with another set of recommendations. Laura Landsiedel/The Bucknellian Andrea Halpern, chairman of the Committee on Instruction, discusses the future of the Jan Plan with the faculty."

Travis, as well as the other faculty in the International Rela tions Program, has been ""pleased with the turn out of about 50 to 70 students at each lecture. We hope to make this lecture series an annual event where each year there would be a lecture series on a critical inter national event.""

FTX,"B y  M ik e  C u rtis Staff Writer The Bison Battalion held its Fall '90 Field Training Exercise (FTX) this past weekend at Camp Karoondinha, PA. The FTX lasted from Friday after noon until noon Sunday. Camp Karoondinha is a Boy Scout camp about 25 miles southwest of Bucknell. The cadets of the Bat talion, from Bloomsburg, Lycoming, Sus- quehana, and Mansfield slept in four person tents at the camp and conducted train ing in nearby areas. The FTX is a chance for the first and second year cadets, usu ally Freshmen and Sophomores (MS I and MS II cadets) to experi ence Army train ing. Christena Johnston, '94 thought it was a great break from the usual campus life. Third year cadets, the MS Ills, conducted advanced individual tactical training and received expe rience in practical leadership of troops throughout the weekend. Most of their training was geared to Advanced Camp in Fort Bragg, NC which they will be attending this summer. The Seniors were in charge of planning and logistics during the weekend. On Saturday morning, the Bucknell cadets went rappelling from two cliffs in the area. The larger one was over 50' tall and overlooked a magnificent valley. Oliver Hasse, '93, an experienced rappeller, commented that he found the rappelling to be ""very challeng ing."" MSG Fred Kleinbacker, the MS I instructor, was instructing cadets at the cliff in how to make their Swiss Seats, which attach a person to the rope for safety pur poses. Some cadets complained about their Swiss Seats being too"

After eating one of the Army's Meals Ready to Eat (MRE), the cadets boarded a truck and headed across the valley to a local rifle range where they received training in Basic Rifle Tom Johnston '93 conquers the rope swing at the obstacle course."
Corrections,"The Bucknellian ran a story in the September 28 issue entitled ""Chi Phi boycotts Senior Gift Drive"" on page 3. The arti cle was in no way intended"
to,"suggest that the boycott was the official policy of the house, but rather the personal decision of the members of the senior class of Chi Phi. issue, The in ""Student In the same Bucknellian stated mistakenly interrogated by police in fake ID case"" on page 3 that the actual student who was ultimately charged was Ted Berry. The stu dent is named Ted Barry. In the October 5 issue, the article enti tled ""Oversight of security raises tough questions"" was not classi fied as a News Analysis piece. Marksmanship. The weapon used was the M16A1 rifle, and the cadets did exercises with the rifle, zeroed the rifle, qualified with it, and learned to strip and clean it The MS III cadets partici pated in individ ual training all day Saturday, learning how to move under fire, and respond to hostile situations. Ed Griebel, '92 was happy with the training, com menting that, ""it should really help out this summer."" Saturday night, the cadets, lead by the MS Ills and evaluated by the MS IVs went out on night patrols. Rick Scott, '93 did not like the fact that he could not see a thing when the moon was hid den. Overall, the night patrol went well, with all squads reaching their objectives. After break fast Sunday morning, the cadets went to the Prison in order to complete a vigorous obstacle course the guards use for training. Each squad com pleted the course as a team. Obsta cles included such things as rope climbing, balancing, going over a wall, and through and under many different objects. Overall, the cadets and instructors were pleased with the conduct and safety of the exercise. There were no injuries and every one is looking forward to the next FTX in the spring."

Bison,"From page 1 Hostetler. The contractor, Hepco. Con struction Co., did request an exten sion of a few days, which the uni versity was obliged to grant. Additional problems resulted from day to day delays. ""We've had other delays. Every construction project is a problem in progress and most of them you are able to sur mount,"" Hostetler said. Plans for the stage area include a hardwood floor, specially treated in the south. The floor arrived incorrectly treated, causing a delay of approximately ten days, according to Hostetler. Delays of this sort are typical to construction projects, Hostetler said, and ""those sorts of things can sometimes be compensated for dur ing the course of the project."" But because of the quick pace of construction, dealing with even day to day problems is difficult. ""We're not able, on a fast-track pro ject of this nature, to bounce back from a lot of the little glitches that are thrown to us by the vaguery of construction,"" said Hostetler. Aside from the cost incurred from the abatement of asbestos, no additional costs accompanied the delays. Replacing the fire-proofing ""did cost some money, but the con struction contract and the construc tion costs associated with the pro ject were not impacted adversely by that delay,"" said Maxwell. The approved project budget of $778,000. The construction accounts for an estimated $441,000, the guaranteed maxi mum price. According to Hostetler, the actual cost of construction should approach, but not exceed, this figure. The remaining $337,000 budgeted for the project will cover furnishings. ""It's a little bit unusual that the Physical Plant would order all the furnishings for the project, but Barry Maxwell has gone on record saying when the project opens he wants everything in place and he thinks we should make one grand display of the whole project,"" said Hostetler. As long as the contractor completes the project within a few weeks of the expected completion date, he should not suffer any losses. The only adverse effect, according to Maxwell, is that ""the construction period will run a little bit longer than we had originally estimated."""

Healthy surprises greet,
visitors at Walnut Acres,"By Jen Marshall Walnut Acres is a cool place. I could tell right from the start, when my tour guide Dennis gave me a free Walnut Acres farm hat. ""Since this is a food processing area,"" he firmly said, ""EVERY ONE has to wear a hat."" I happily set my green and white paper hat on my head, ready to experience organic farming. ""Did you know,"" Dennis proudly announced, ""that people have been spotted all over wearing these hats? They wear them to fairs and to concerts and just about anywhere!"" I liked Den nis a lot, but I wondered what kinds of concerts he went to. I didn't have much time to think about Den nis's probable bam jamborees star ring Bobby Hayseed Joe, because he started talking about Walnut Acres farm almost faster than I could write. Walnut Acres, located about thirty minutes from Bucknell in Penns Creek, is a world famous organic farm. (And you thought that there wasn't anything exciting for miles around this side of Phili- delphia!) Walnut Acres was founded by Paul and Betty Keene in 1946, a farming couple dedicated to chemical-free agriculture. Paul and Betty met while teaching at a mission school in India. It was there that they became interested in organic farming, and decided to move their agricultural adventures to Pennsylvania Deeply in debt after puchasing land and then farm equipment, Paul and Betty had just enough money to convert the land's existing crop of apples into an apple butter called ""Apple Essence."" Somehow, the food critic from the New York Times tasted it, and then wrote a glowing review of Walnut Acres' first product. Paul and Betty were suddenly swamped with mail order requests for Apple Essence, which they sold for one dollar a quart. Walnut Acres today produces over two hundred and fifty farm fresh, organic products. There is a store and small dining area at the farm, and a catalogue of tasty, but healthy treats can now be had at your nearest mailbox. Den nis informed me that Walnut Acres has customers from all over, even from Africa and Tasmania. Dennis began our tour in the warehouse, which was adjacent to the store. The warehouse was large, and full of stacks of boxes marked ""com chowder."" I saw a few Wal nut Acres workers moving crates and pushing hand carts. They weren't wearing hats, and I was beginning to suspect that Dennis just liked to make visitors look like geeks. The only thing memorable about the warehouse was it's extreme cleanliness. Everything at Walnut Acres seemed to sparkle. Other than that, it was an average warehouse. Our next stop was the gigan tic refrigeration room. Since Wal nut Acres doesn't use preserva tives, refrigeration is neccessary to keep their products fresh. Dennis had an interesting trivia fact for us while we toured the forty degree store-room. Did you know that on the average, the food that you buy and eat from the supermarket has traveled TWO THOUSAND miles before it reaches your stomach?! Yikes! Walnut Acres looks better and better, seeing as most of their products are produced and pack aged on the premises. Did you ever see the movie Charlie and the Chocolate Fac tory? Well, Walnut Acres' bakery looks just like the one at Willie Wonka's Chocolate Factory. The machines are pleasantly antiquated, and an air of kinship pervades among the bakers. Cookies and breads are made fresh, with mini mal use of sugar and salt Almost all of the baking process is done by hand. Everything is made in small batches, because most things at the Walnut Acres store only sit on the shelf for two weeks. Compare that to the twinkie that's probably been sitting on Weis' shelf since the stone age! We visited the packaging area, and the mail room. All of the workers seemed to love each other so much. They were smiling and chatting and listening to country music. (And most of them weren't wearing hats!) Dennis soon explained the family-like atmos phere of Walnut Acres. Everyone practically IS family! Mothers, daughters, fathers, sons-in-law and cousins all work together at Walnut Acres. The two women managing the mail room were mother and daughter, and they worked together all day, everyday without tearing each other's eyes out I was impressed. Walnut Acres is an employee-owned company. The longer a person works there, the more company stock they can own. As a result, job turnover at Walnut Acres is miminal. At last, we got to go shop ping in the Walnut Acres store! Don't get me wrong, Dennis was a superb tour guide, but this roving reporter was STARVING. The lunch counter, sadly, is open 11 a.m. to 2 p.m., and I got to the store at about 2:40. So, instead of sam- Photo by Jen Marshall Dennis the tour guide stocks shelves in the retail store after leading visitors through Walnut Acres' organic farm complex. pling wheat-crust pizza, I was forced to eat a healhy brownie. Why do these things happen to me? The store, on the whole, was awe some! They had granola, pancake mixes, cookies, veggie burgers, bread, juice, beans, candy, books, jewelry, rocks, T-shirts, posters, bags, and clocks, to name a few things. I bought some maple almond granola, sugar-free peach poptarts, a neat purple wolf T-shirt and a few brownies. Everything (except the T-shirt) was positively delicious. After I made my pur chases, I decided it was time to be a photo-journalist, and so much to everyone's annoyance I whipped out my camera. The people at Wal nut Acres don't like to have their picture taken. They wouldn't let me take a picture of their Willie Wonka bakery. Relax, Dennis, I'm not going to send the pictures to the Russians! Adding to my camera woes were the Menninites, who were also shopping at Walnut Acres on that rainy afternoon. They hate to have their picture taken even more than the bakery workers do. Somehow, I managed to take several pictures and leave the store with my purchases without anyone dumping a bag of organically grown peas on my head. If, one fine afternoon, you find yourself weary of Hostess Ring Dings and Oreos, make a trip to Walnut Acres. There, you can find a wealth of healthy, but won derful foods, AND get a free hat to wear to the next Aerosmith con cert!

Basically every one thinks I'm happy go lucky, which is probably true. by Cindy Levinson Staff Writer Bucknell has had a long his tory of interesting traditions, some of which are still common today. For example, the ""Freshmen Fif teen"" is attributed to the ""hoagie lady"" who came to the dorms every night with a cart filled with freshly baked chocolate chip cookies, chocolate milk from Betchel's Dairy and hoagies. One of the fondest memories of Win Springer Brickmeier ('63) as written in ""Kiss--on the first date?"" in Bucknell World (Septem ber, 1990) was the serenades. Fra ternity members would stand below a balcony in their fraternity blazers, holding candles, sing serenades to the sweetheart of their fraternity. It was every girls dream to be admired by a frat. Some lingo, as found in the B.U. Traditions file in the Bucknell archives, includes the phrase ""Hell Week"" which refers a time in the fall after school has started when freshmen women appear without makeup and wear weird things at the request of sophomore women. ""Sem"" was the name given to the Women's College that came from when the boys called on the girls at the Women's Seminary once a week and stayed until nine o'clock. An ""import"" was a girlfriend who came to stay for a weekend and was often treated poorly by the women in the Sem. What is now called the Bison, was called George's. Words like ""Soash"" (sociology), ""Sike"" (psychology), ""Poly Si"" (political science), and ""Fizz Ed"" (physical education) are still used today. Many of the traditions, though, involve freshmen hazing and general harassment of the freshmen class by the sophomore class. In 1909, a former Bucknell student, Wm. A. Bartol wrote a booklet entitled Bucknell Tradi tions. He refered to freshmen with names such as ""papoose"" and ignoramus."" Upperclassmen would shout ""Freshmen Look!"" and then begin pointing at and mocking freshmen. He also included a satiri cal characterization of freshmen as follows: I. Freshmen wear regulation postage stamps on their pates. II. Freshmen keep their toot sies warm with shoes. III. Freshmen keep on the everlasting forward march and let the other classmen loaf. IV. Freshmen eat, drink, sleep, attend recitations, functions, and walk or breathe only on partic ular request. Understand! V. Freshmen are it in the uni versity game of tag. In an article entitled ""Rebel in a Birdcage"" by B. Winston Bar rett ('31) in Bucknell World (July, 1987), there are stories of how one freshmen was ""paddled severely enough to draw blood."" The author relates how he was accused of not speaking to anyone, especially upperclassmen, so he received three swats with the paddle and had to wear a birdcage on his head, opening the little door each time he opened his mouth to speak. Beginning in the late nine teenth century and continuing until the 1970's, the freshmen and soph omore classes participated in class scraps. The two classes lined up about 30 feet apart and when a gun was fired, they ran at one another and tried to pull members of the other class over their own start line. Freshmen often wore green cross marks on their faces. There were also proclama tions posted around the campus by the sophomore class. Several of these can be found in the Bucknell archives. In 1908, the sophomore class made one, addressing the freshmen class as ""Ye sophisticated clods of verdure,"" proclaiming that they must be in bed before seven o clock, contribute to a fund for soda water for the sophomore girls, and their milk bottles must be ster ilized. The class of 1911 said, Freshmen must shine shoes, run errands, empty 'gym' buckets, clean rooms, and make themselves ' generally useful to Sophomores and upperclassmen."" The proclamation of the class of 1913 read: See yourselves as others see you...the infinitesimal, snivelling freaks, snobs, and other wise heterogenous specimens of pestiferous parsites... pimps, skunks, and old superfluous encumbrances."" There are many other Buck nell traditions as well and many of these, as well as the ones men tioned, have been common at other colleges. Years from now, events such as Greek Week and other eve ryday activities such as going to the Bison and fraternities' selling T- shiits and pretzels may simply be thought of as traditions of the past."

Freshman elected to top position,
of Key Club International,"By Claire Davidson Dee Bothelo, a freshman this year at Bucknell, recently finished her second term as a trustee of Key Club International. Key Club is a school service organization that encourages involvement in the community. It is completely run by high school students and includes more than 133,000 members in more that 3,800 clubs in the United States, Canada and 12 other countries. Dee became involved in Key Club in Michigan, when her brother who was a member of the club brought her to one of their local meetings. She took an immediate liking to the club and decided to became a member herself. ""I loved it It was so much fun."" However, when Dee's family moved to Man chester, New Hampshire, there was no Key Club established in their district. Dee therefore decide to start a club with the help of a nearby district. In the summer before her jun ior year and her move to Manches ter, she decided to run for interna tional trustee. ""As I knew I was moving I couldn't run for governor of the district. Therefore I decided to run for international trustee. I didn't want to stop serving,"" she explained. Dee was elected one of 14 trustees at the International Con vention in Anaheim, California. The following year she was re elected at the convention in Orlando, Florida. During her first year as trus tee she represented all of New Eng land and Michigan. In her second term she represented East Canada, the Caribbean Islands and Michi gan. ""I was a link between the international and district and state levels,"" explained Dee. She attended district board meetings where she would help the districts run their particular club. ""My job to get people involved,"" she explained. She also had to make sure that all the by laws were being upheld in the constitution. Dee's involvement was not just limited to the role of a trustee. She also served on two committees; Theme in Major Emphasis commit- Ashley Chertkof/The Bucknellian Dee Bothelo has served several terms in the prestigious postion of trus tee for Key Club International. involved a lot of communication through letters and phone calls,"" she remarked. Dee also gave speeches and held workshops, help ing to train the new and upcoming leaders. ""I ran educational activities tee and the District Services com mittee. The purpose of the first committee was to ""plan the entire program that the key club will be run on next year,"" commented Dee. They were the group who were in charge of creating the Key Club theme which next year will be to renew your committment to the community and home and to main tain academics. The second committee was in charge of establishing programs to help districts build their clubs, to generally strengthen each individ ual district They also judged mem bers of the Key Clubs for outstand ing officer awards, an honor which Dee received herself for outstand ing board member. For Dee, the advantages of being involved in Key Club far out weigh any disadvantages. ""The only disadvantage was that it took a lot of time. I had to make a lot of sacrifices for Key Club but they were well worth the benefits I received,"" commented Dee. Dee explained that the num ber of people she met and got to talk with was the biggest advantage. ""I even got to learn how to give speeches to an audience of 2500 people."" She has traveled all over the world, to such places as China, Canada, Aruba, the Bahamas, Ber muda and all across the United States. ""I met all these people whose goal was to serve. All the people I met was an incredible experience that I will never forget,"" she explained. Dee's goal now is to go to law school. She has a double major in political science and education and is also taking courses in history and English. ""I mostly want to keep up my GPA,"" she commented. Dee also hopes to get involved with The Bucknellian, the yearbook and the literary magazine."
Animal Behavior professor ahi 177,
with information about bees,"By Jen Marshall Professor David J. Fletcher, of Animal Behavior Studies, I was sure had an impressive collection of deadly killer bees and ferocious fire ants. I imagined his basement to be filled with menacing hives and carefully locked ant farms. With these frightful images in mind, I excitedly set out to interview this bug-friend of a professor. After a few wrong turns, I located his office--B10 of Coleman Hall. It was empty. Hearing voices in the next office, I ventured across the hall. I asked the man sitting there if he was Professor Fletcher. He said ""no."" ""Great,"" I thought, ""He for got that I was coming and now I'm not going to have an article and my editor is going to hate me..."" The strange man's voice broke my fran tic mental reverie. ""I,"" he laughed, ""am David Fletcher. Let's go into my office."" Relieved, I followed him back to B10, ready to conduct my first interview for The Buck nellian. Professor Fletcher did not act like a happy guest on The Geraldo Show. Instead he asked me why I thought he should let me interview him. Panic started to set in again. I was beginning to suspect that Professor Fletcher had been stung one too many times by his killer bees. After talking with Professor Fletcher for some time, I began to understand his intial reluctance. Killer bees, it turns out, have been given a ""bad rap.""

Eat in or Take out,"One of Lewisburg's (many) dining shortcomings has finally been remedied. Market Street is now home to a new deli, The Mar ket Street Deli. Now that parent's weekend is upon us, Julie and Steve thought it befitting and opportune to remark on the new restaurant establish ment's quality, service and offerings. Julie decided to try the turkey and Swiss sandwich, served on a poppy seed bagel. It was amazing... Dagwood Bumstead would be proud. The serving was plentiful and the turkey, bagel and fixin's were all very fresh. Steve sampled the ham and Swiss sandwich on a plain bagel. The sandwich was everything a sandwich should be: filling, fresh and tasty. Julie and Steve both ordered a basket of fries to complement their sandwiches. The fries were served fresh out of the fryer, piping hot and crispy. The Market Street Deli has a wide selection of sandwich offer ings: roast beef, salami, liverwurst, tuna, chicken salad and corned beef to name a few. Sandwiches are served on your choice of bread... white, wheat, rye, hardroll or bagel. Meat (Boar's Head) and salads are also available for take out. The Deli also offers breakfast The menu includes eggs pan cakes, bagels, bacon, muffins and homefries. Prices are reasonable and the service is outstanding. Julie and Steve were impressed by the new deli on the block... and you will be too! And the rating is... drum roll please... four bison (on a scale of one to five)!"

&,"a stinger bigger than your last mea sles vaccination. The thought of these monsters on campus would inspire fear in any football player's heart Professor Fletcher wants everyone to know that there ARE NOT any ""killer bees"" at or near Bucknell. The bees that he keeps in harmless hives in his lab are mere honeybees. Real ""killer bees"" are truely called the ""African bee."" These bees are smaller than the honeybee and their sting would hardly cause instant death. There is, however, reason to fear the African bee's eventual migration into North America. The African bee was brought to South America for research pur poses some years ago. Recently, 26 colonies accidentally escaped and have been travelling north. These bees are expected to reach the lower states by the summer of 1991. If the African bee is harm less, then why are we concerned? Nine to nineteen million dollars of american agriculture relies on the controlled use of bees for pollina tion. The African bee does not lend itself to pollination. People can work alongside the honeybee with a relatively low risk of being stung, but the same is not true of the Afri can bee. The African bee, although not poisonous, is extremely agres- sive. Workers would be continu ally stung and the agricultural bal ance would be upset. If the African bee population displaces the hon eybee population, then commercial beekeepers and American fanners would be in trouble. Obviously, action has to be taken. Professor Fletcher is not only a professor at Bucknell, he is co- chairperson of The Beekeeping Advisory Board of Pennsylvania. The problem of the African bee migration is of high interest to him. Several solutions are being dis- Courtesy Public Relations Professor David Fletcher is co chairperson of The Beekeeping Advisory Board of Pennsylvania. cussed, and all agree that action will be taken on a state level. Any one interested in fine detail of the African bee problem can read a book that is co-edited by Professor Fletcher himself. The book, as of now untitled, will be published soon. As Professor Fletcher ex plained all of this to me, 1 forgave him for his earlier lack of enthu siasm. He probably thought that I was going to write a sensationalist article worthy of The National Enquirer. Admittedly, I had vague ideas in that general direction, but after my interview with Professor Fletcher, I saw that the issue deserved a lot more respect. Profes sor Fletcher has devoted a number of years to the study of the social evolutions of ants and bees. He has lived in Africa, teaching at the Uni versity of Natal in South Africa. He DID have fire ants at Bucknell some time ago, but fire ants don't like Pennsylvania. It's too cold for them. Professor Fletcher had to give them away to a colleauge at the University of Texas.

Bucknell in the 90's,"With the publication of U.S. News and World Report1* college rankings, the issues of Buckner* image and its future as an institution of higher learning are once again fresh in our minds Just where does our University stand? In the past few years. Bucknell University, under the leadership of President Gary Soika has raised over $90 million. Evidence of the success of this massive fundraising effort can be seen across campus the Chemistry and Biology buildings, parking lots, renovations to Olin Sci ence as well as scores of pieces of new equipment. As students, we now have better living, studying and research facilities. We have been pro vided with state-of-the-art research equipment and a more plentiful and wider arrav of finan cial aid opportunities. Life at Bucknell. it would appear, is on the up and up. We live, work and play on one of the most scenic campuses in the Northeast. We have facili ties and opportunities as undergraduates that other university's can only strive to provide for their students. Bucknell, we are told, is one of the most prestigious universities in the United States. Why then should we look to the future with anxiety? Colleges across the United States are forseeing significant drops in enrollment in coming vears This year the market saw up to 35% fewer first-year college students.

P.O.W.E.R. discusses campus,
responses to chalk quotations,"To the Editor: A curious thing happened last week; perhaps you witnessed it as well. We, P.O.W.E.R., placed vari ous quotations between the library and the Langone Center last Wednesday, all of which were taken from the written remains of many famous men. The reason we did this is not to insult anyone's intelligence and assume that stu dents had not known that these men had, to a twentieth-century mind, many faults, but rather to highlight them in order to show what our col lective history is. The words we copied are not generally placed in standard textbooks on philosophy nor italicized in works of literature by the editor, they are easy to miss. One reason it is so simple to disre gard such misogynist sentiments is because we seem to be so quick to explain it all away with statements such as; he was only saying what everyone else from his era was say ing; he was actually more progres sive than the others; you can't judge a sixteenth-century man with twentieth-century values. And P.O.W.E.R. does not deny these arguments. Rather, we want to begin the~semester by highlighting these statements for everyone to see, so that we recognize the kind of images which were used in the past to degrade women, and to rein force the amount of text devoted by men to keep woman in her place (it is far easier to find negative quota tions by men than positive quota tions by women). We cannot justify dealing with present-day issues until we establish, for ourselves and for the campus, the history from which we come. The curious thing that hap pened is not our engaging in chalk writing, since we do that often enough. It was the responses writ ten beneath the more suggestive quotations, which, although not a new phenomenon, has nevertheless changed its tone. Our fellow chalker appeared to heartily agree with words such as these: ""One cannot contemplate the depths of women; they are not even shal low.""--Nietzsche. Our undaunted reader jumped from one quote to the next, embellishing each with a phrase of wisdom. To Nietzsche he responded, ""Fantastic stuff!"" To Benjamin Franklin's words, ""She who paints her face thinks of her tail,"" he added ""I think of her tail as well."" Perhaps you can tell as well as we can that the tone of the remarks is one of mockery as opposed to hostility and attack. If we can treat the words of these can onized men with little shock or apparent concern, perhaps this indi cates a readiness to tackle the present, along with the undergird ing past."

Students thank,
Kappa Sigma,"To the Editor: On Saturday night, at approximately 2 a.m,, we were at Kappa Sigma as the party was winding down. Out of the blue, we were swept into the kitchen by a hungry mob of partygoers. Bewildered at first, we feared that Security had made another daring attempt to crush one more chapter of the Greek Empire at Bucknell. For once this was not the case. Once inside the kitchen, we saw Kappa Sig's chef preparing a post-party breakfast feast. The masses of people cheered him on as he flipped the eggs and bacon and so deftly han dled the hash brown tray. He turned, for a moment, from the sizzling gnll to explain the purpose of his mission. He simply stated that he didn t want anyone driving drunk in search of food. We gladly accepted this generous offer. Refueled and invigorated, we and our friends made the trek back uphill without any of the usual problems Gike bushes, steps, Security). Thanks! to the brothers and chef of Kappa Sig.

Fetal Protection safeguards industry...Finally,
Policy is,
a,
means of preventing birth defect litigation-not discriminating against,"By Mark Leister Staff Writer An issue laden with the tradi tionally weighted language of dis crimination and rights of the unborn recently entered the realm of the highest court in our nation. The exact nature of the case is that of fetal protection in industry and, following on the heels of the ever- heated abortion issue, the sides are digging in for a fight. There can be no denying the importance of the issue--it has the potential to impact nearly 20 mil lion jobs and affect nearly a fifth of the blue-collar work force. Women, aged eighteen to fifty-five who can bear children, could be forced from industrial positions that are deemed high health risks to any future chil dren the woman may bear.' The specific case revolves around Johnson Controls* present policy of excluding women of childbearing age from its factory because of high lead concentrations in its plant. The Milwaukee-based car-battery manufacturer has found it wiser to exclude women and risk discrimination suits than to open its doors to the many liability claims that arise from associated birth defects. The opposition, primarily female employees and the National Organization of Women (N.O.W.), has deemed this policy discrimina tory and lacking in scientific valid ity. It claims that this standard is an unjustified means of excluding women from the higher paying industrial-level jobs. What it is, in reality, is an effort to finally protect industry from unnecessary litigation. So...do we make an effort to protect the manufacturers from law suits, women from discrimination, or fetuses from birth defects? For the purpose of this issue, I contend that first and foremost, the rights of the fetus are irrelevant and the Supreme Court will probably agree--why? Precedent. First, our courts have been unable to decide exactly what to do about the rights of the unborn. The nation is already in a quandary over Roe v. Wade and its relevance to many issues; the Court is certainly not going to write an opinion that will under mine that still undecided case. Second, this case does not hinge on the issue of morals; it is an issue of law, and that, I believe, is what the Justices will address. The question is straightforward; is the exclusion of women from a certain division of industry to curb costly birth defect litigation appropriate? For these reasons, the Supreme Court will probably avoid the fetal rights question at all costs and instead focus on the battle between manu facturers and women. But there's a twist. Women's advocacy groups are trying to bring about a change in the policy by insisting that men be included in this war on birth defects. Representatives of N.O.W. argue that since men contribute half of the genetic make-up of the fetus, they too should be removed from any potentially hazardous workplaces. This proposal, however, has fallen on deaf ears because it lacks There is no substantiated link between the production of eggs and sperm and the disorders associated with lead. Therefore, it is important to realize that men, whose sperm contribute only genetic material to the fetus, cannot be considered at risk. However, women, in whom the entire developmental process occurs, are at risk, because damag- the foundation of medical data that is now available. The specific case before the Supreme Court concerns high concentrations of lead--an element that has been linked to sig nificant nervous system disorders in newborns. Birth defects caused by high lead concentrations are not genetic in nature; they are developmental. ing levels of lead can be passed from the mother to the fetus. And seemingly little can be done to alle viate that risk. The Occupational Safety and Health Act (O.S.H.A) has brought about firm standards for safe lead levels in industry. These levels, which are far from harmful to adult humans, are well above the safe range for fetuses. This aspect of the issue has sparked debate as well. If levels can be lowered to within the adult safe-range, why can't the manufac turers be forced to lower them to meet levels safe for fetuses as well? The National Association of Manu facturers has the answers. First, industry has already met the O.S.H.A. standards which were very costly. Plus, the factory divisions in ques tion had high lead concentrations to begin with--that was the nature of the problem. For instance, the man ufacturing pro cess of car batter ies requires steps that expose work ers to large quan tities of lead. It would be incon ceivable, if not entirely impossi ble, to lower the levels to fetus- safe standards. Second, if the levels could be reduced, they would be very costly, and unless #--J the levels were ** absolutely negli gible, suits could still be filed. It would require the near eradication of lead in the workplace to protect the company against birth defect litigation. Finally, there is the question of to whom the manufacturer has the greatest responsibility. The company employs adults, not fetuses; it should not be forced to"
women,"tailor its production to fetal health levels. It should be required to pro mote the health of the individuals it originally hired. Worker safety and fetal safety cannot be considered synonymous. But the companies have not been completely uncaring. They have tried to work with their female employees. They claim that they have tried to eliminate the quarrel some elements of their policy by encouraging voluntary relocation. General Motors (G.M.) imple mented a five-year program some years ago, that entitled anyone to work in the company's high-lead areas--with one request They encouraged their childbearing- aged female employees to transfer to other, less hazardous, sections of the plant if they were planning families. How successful was this pro gram? Moderate (at best). G.M. reported that over the five years, there were six pregnancies in the high-lead division--one of which resulted in a fetus with severe birth defects and a barrage of costly litigation. It is for this exact reason that the manufacturers have begun to implement policies such as the one before the Supreme Court. Compa nies must have a means of protect ing themselves from the costly liti gations arising from lead-related birth defects. If there were another way to guarantee that such lawsuits would not surface. I'm sure the fac tories would accept it; since no such options are presently availa ble, the exclusion from hazardous high-lead workplaces of fertile, childbearing-aged women should be permitted."

"look bright for ""Little Feat""","Little Feat percussionist/conga player Sam Clayton put on an excellent performance last Friday night. By Jon Elliott Staff Writer Friday night Davis Gym and all who were present experienced a performance which is difficult to describe in words. The energy and music which flowed through the guitars, drums, bongos and mando lins of Warner Bros, recording art ists Little Feat will be felt for quite some time on Bucknell's campus. At a point in the university's history when campus-wide social events are few and far between, the Bucknell Concert Committee suc cessfully provided a glimmer of hope in a sea of general student apathy and discontent To see more than two thousand fans, both young and old, singing along to such Lit tle Feat classics as ""Fat Man In the Bathtub"" and ""Oh, Atlanta"" was a pleasant sight for fans to see and surely for the hand as well. After the nearly six hours of stage set-up, and an exciting sound check which included ""Rad Gumbo"" and a obscure version of ""Sailin' Shoes,"" I had the fortunate opportunity to be able to sit down with drummer and original band member Richie Hayward and dis cuss the many things which have made Feat tick for so many years. This opportunity only came after a quite a bit of waiting in order to receive permission for the inter view from the appropriate managers. Hayward, sitting at a make shift banquet table in the weight room annex of Davis Gym, answered my questions with the flare and enthusiasm of a starry eyed newcomer being interviewed by Barbara Walters. I began by observing that Little Feat has run the gamut of live performances, from headlining a show, to opening for the Grateful Dead, to playing in front of almost three thousand col lege kids in Lewisburg, Pa. Simul taneously, the band has been able to keep up an energy-filled perfor mance surpassed by few, and 1 was curious as to how the band main tains such energy and good spirits. Hayward responded by saying ""We just do it. There's no secret. It's not bad."" And that's the way Hayward spoke throughout our conversation: soft, sincere and to the point. He said what was on his mind, and unlike many rock stars of today, was not caught up in the hype of being a big star. He seemed to enjoy the idea that what he and the late Lowell George started twenty years ago is still strong enough to be of interest to fans both young and old. Hayward continued by responding that Feat has been on the road since April 26 and expects to finish the Representing the Mam bo tour in mid-November. Little Feat's history has been a roller coaster ride of ups and downs, and Hayward feels the group is stronger and ""better now than we have ever been. The future looks very promising. And we intend to keep going for years. Until our minds make promises that our bodys can't fill."" Hayward explained to me that Little Feat decided to re-group, after a nearly nine year hiatus because they ""missed playing together. And now we're free to do more. Not because we needed to pay the rent. It was just time to get together and give it a go. It's a drummers dream."" As a proliferate Rock and Roll drummer, Hayward's child hood musical influences revealed what his performances reflect on stage. As a purist, it was not sur prising to hear him say the Big Bands, Jazz, and the Blues molded the way that he plays today. Hear ing Hayward mention people like Count Basie, Miles Davis, Ray Charles and Muddy Waters as indi viduals whom he admired growing up enabled me to link Hayward's bright past with his even brighter future. We wound up the rather intri guing and meaningful conversation with an off-the-cuff conversation about sponsorship of big name groups by major corporations. His views on the recent ""sell-outs"" by the Rolling Stones and the Who were quite surprising. He didn't mind the idea that Mick and the boys were being sponsored by Bud- weiser saying ""I don't care. It's business. Just as long as the corpo ration isn't harmful, like Dupont, or something like that. I wouldn't mind being sponsored, it would mean more money in my pocket, it's just that nobody has asked us. It's a business."" Richie Hayward not only keeps the beat to one of the liveliest rock bands around today, but at 44 years old, he also speaks with the flare, spunk and naive optimism of a college freshman. Now entering their third decade on vinyl and on tour, Hayward says that Little Feat is just as strong and possibly even stronger than they were in the '70s with George at the helm. Upon completion of this tom- in November, Little Feat expects to take a short break and plans on going back into the studio to start working on their third album since regrouping in 1988. Hayward explained that the group has some of their new material down on paper already, and that they hope the new album will be released in August of next year. Photo by Craig Bitter Little Feat has had an excellent career thus far and continues down the road to success with their next album coming out in August.

Craft Shop opens down under,"Allison Zadroga/The Bucknellian After faring problems of all shapes and sizes, the Craft Shop has now reopened in the basement of Hunt Hall. Although the location is less than desireable, it is going to have to suffice for the time being. By Lydia G. Neuman Anyone who has ever applied his or her hands and brains to a material to make something, write something or produce something from nothing and experienced joy through this process, should iden tify with Langdon Warner's state ment, ""knowledge of natural pro cesses is the very basis of all arts which transform raw materials into artifacts. Possession of the myster ies of a craft means nothing less than a power over nature gods and it creates a priest out of the man who controls it."" The relocation of the Craft Shop to the ground floor of Hunt Hall is facing delays of what may amount to several weeks. Craft Shop director Molly Ross praised the efforts of the physical plant in aiding the move and hopes the delay will not mean that classes-- many of which are already full-- will have to be rescheduled. Although the new site in Hunt is preferable to some of the other pos sibilities--the boonies of the obser vatory, to name one remote sugges tion--the program will suffer from the loss of the centrality offered by theUC. According to Ross, last year's open forums to discuss the matter of relocation were well-attended by both students and members of the community on behalf of the Craft Shop. Yet for some reason, an array of craft opportunities has been dis placed from an already insufficient space to one that is even less adequate. The electrical system in Hunt--a building in which hair dryers are outlawed--is incapable of supplying the power needed to run all four pottery wheels at the same time. The lack of any exhaust system at all makes the use of kilns an impossibility, and means that no ceramic work can be fired. Enroll ment in pottery classes has already overflowed beyond capacity; wait ing lists had to be started on the very first day of registration. Against the odds, the Craft Shop has thrived since Ross ini tiated the venture eighteen years ago. Seventy-four students enrolled in a wide variety of classes and workshops during the 1990 January program and Ross feels confident that current delays are minor and says they should not stop anyone from registering and seeking information Over the years, the program has retained an identity that is sep arate from the Art Department, freeing students from the intimidat ing nature of unfamiliar media. Whether or not the Craft Shop's strictly non-credit policy is fair to those who are experienced or seri ous enough to take the ""risk"" of credit remains a question.. The energy of the Craft Shop's staff has not wavered and, hopefully, the inconvenience of the new location will not be too daunt ing for those who find the program a true resource.

"The ""Karamazov Brothers"" bring the family together","By Cynthia Levinson Staff Writer Parent's weekend at Bucknell will be chock full o' exciting events beginning on Friday and running all the way through Sunday. The play, Rosmersholm, the concert of the Chapel Choir, Concert Chorale, and Ringers, and the Christy's eve ning events are just a few of the exciting things scheduled for the upcoming weekend. One of the highlights of the weekend will be the performance of the world renowned Flying Karamazov Brothers. The Flying Karamazov Brothers will be presenting a vaudeville-type show combined with juggling and music. The group is comprised of Howard Jay Patter son, Sam Williams, Paiil David Magid, and Timothy FursL Ok, so they're not really brothers, but this doesn't seem to have hindered their success. In fact, the Flying Karama zov Brothers are anything but unsuccessful. The group has made quite a name for itself through itsnational and international performances. They have made several appear ances on NBC's 'Today,"" ""The Pat Sajak Show,"" ""Late Night with Joan Rivers,"" and ""Merv Griffin."" The group has also put on their own specials on Showtime and PBS. Their PBS special won an Emmy for Outstanding Entertain ment Programming. Other performances have ranged from participation in the Edinburgh International Theatre Festival (not once, but three times) and two appearances at the Hong Kong International Festival of Art. The Flying Karamazov Brothers have also had two successful runs on Broadway, and co-starred in the hit movie, ""The Jewel of the Nile."" So, ""Why,"" you ask, ""are these successful performers coming to Lewisburg?"" It seems to me that their appearance tomorrow night at 8:30 p.m. in the Weis Center has something to do with some good planning here on campus. The Fly ing Karamazov Brothers should definitely appeal to your younger brothers and sisters, your parents, and who knows, Bucknellians, maybe you too will enjoy a differ ent sort of Saturday night entertain ment for a change! This perform- nace definitely looks like something worth checking into. So, for all of you students who are lucky enough to have your parents here for the weekend, good luck and don't forget to enjoy yourselves!"

"Ibsen's ""Rosmersholm"" defines existence","By Karen McCann The Department of Theatre and Dance announces the first pro duction of its 1990-91 season, Ros mersholm, by Henrik Ibsen. Set in 19th Century Norway, the story centers on a man and a woman drawn together by hopes of a future liberated from the restrictions of their times. Their efforts are under mined by past secrets, inner voices and politi cal realities which drive them to bold action at the play's startling conclusion. Robert Gainer, Director of Rosmersholm and Chair of the Department of Theatre and Dance, adds, ""This play marks a turning point in Ibsen's play writing career. The author begins to explore how human existence is defined both by the tensions in our public lives and in our innermost private realms. Rosmersholm's protagonists' lives are shaped by the disturbing social pressures around them, as well as the complex psychological realities that confront them from within. It is a challenging and rewarding play to realize for both the director and"

General Lee Speaking,
Ghost wos absolutely boo-tifi il,"By Lee Guzofski Staff Writer Yes, yes; it is I once again. No stop, you're too kind. Well, enough of the formalities; let's get down to business: movie reviews, those fiendish capsules that are supposed to tell you, the reader, whether a movie (that you've probably already seen any way) is worth seeing. Kind of pointless and condescending, don't you think? But, for those of you who just can't get enough and have devoted your lives to read ing these journalistic blurbs I shall henceforth press ever onward, selflessly, for your pleasure... The movie that I took in this past week was Ghost, starring Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore as a pair of lovers who are so bound to each other that even when Sam (Swayze) is murdered, his spirit stays in the physical world to protect Molly (Moore). The movie's plot revolves around Sam's discovering the motives behind his murder and solving not only that crime, but a money laundering racket in the bank he worked in. Personally, on the surface I thought that this sounded like the dumbest idea for a movie since The StufT (which was about killer ice cream). I mean let's be honest, who wants to see a supernatural com edy, suspense, whodunit, love story that takes place on the ethereal plane? Not me, said I. However... Patrick Swayze just dirty danced his way into my heart, as did Demi Moore who cried more tears than Tammy Bakker, but always at the right moment. Whoopi Goldberg offered some brilliant moments of comic relief as"
Parents Weekend at Peachbottom's,"the psychic adviser Oda Mae Brown. This film was a touching, heartwarming story that not only drew the audience in (especially if you took a date) but also offered some intriguing theories on the concept of death. Ghost was an interesting follow-up to last week's Flatliners although Ghost centered on the differences between good and evil spirits and what happens when heaven or hell comes to call... At any rate, I really fell in love with this film and 1 would recommend it to any star-crossed lovers out there who are willing to believe in the power of love...

Calvin Hill speaks,
at Weis Center,"By Mark Abrahamsen Staff Writer Former National Football League Rookie of the Year Calvin Hill presented a public lecture last Sunday in the Weis Center. The presentation, attended by approxi mately 2S0 Bucknell students, was focused primarily on the evils of drugs and alcohol in all phases of the sports arena. Hill, a 1969 Yale graduate, was drafted by the Dallas Cowboys out of college and had many super lative years as one of the finest wide receivers in the NFL. When Hill first started witnessing athletes taking drugs in the early 1970's, he never gave it much thought to it, as amphetamines and marajuana were thought of as popular, ""recrea tional"" drugs of the times. On a Monday night game the Cowboys were in Texas Stadium when Hill noticed a peculiar ban ner in the stands. ""South Amer ica's Team"" said the sign, and the message perceived to Hill was that the public seemed to know that many of the Cowboys were sub stance abusers. This helped ""wake up"" Hill to know that there was a problem of drug use within the franchise. For the majority of the lec ture, he spoke primarily about alcohol, and how its affect can be detrimental to the body and mind. Hill presented an eight-point test to help one determine if a friend were an alcoholic, while emphasizing the idea that one should think of the consequences when he or she decides to drink. Hill is currently a career planning advisor/drug counselor for the Cleveland Browns, and he speaks at different college cam puses whenever possible."
Crew acquires varsity,
"status, buys new boats","By Amanda Kessler The Bucknell crew team is enjoying its first season under var sity status. The team now has the advantages of other varsity sports and is continuously upgrading its program. The season got off to a flying start with the purchase of two new Vespoli shells, which will allow the team to compete at a higher level than it had in previous seasons. This new equipment, along with a growing student interest in the sport will hopefully result in an increased achievement record for the Bucknell crew team. Many novice men and women came out for the sport this fall. They are hard at work, not only learning how to row, but also understanding the large amount of dedication crew asks from the indi vidual. Rowers rise at S a.m. on numerous mornings of the week, have practice, and return to campus before most Bucknellians even hear the ring of their alarms. Certainly it is the sport for the morning person and the undedicated are quickly weeded out The crew team will celebrate its varsity status tomorrow during Parents' Weekend. All parents of rowers are invited down to the landing for a barbeque and the christening of the new Vespolis. Scheduled to speak at the event are Head Coach John Skotedis, crew President Robert Hinton, 1989 men's captain Andrew Schoudel, and tentatively, Rick Hartzell, Bucknell Director of Athletics. All boats will row in demon stration races to introduce the par ents to the Bucknell crew program. Following the rowing demonstra tion, the team will sponsor an infor mal lunch for all parents and row ers. The events are expected to begin at 9:30 a.m., and should end by noon. strange game on Tuesday versus Towson State. Army and the Bison played before an estimated 970 people last Saturday at the East Field. Bucknell exerted its dominance from the out set, and almost scored on their first possession, when Brandon Poe '91 lofted a crossing pass that Jon Mackenzie '93 headed just wide of the Army net. Bucknell did manage to capi talize just 3:16 into the game when a Mackenzie cross took a crazy hop past Cadet keeper Rich Pellegrini right to a waiting Gulick, who promptly headed it into a wide- open net for a quick 1-0 advantage. The Bison kept the pressure on, and just two minutes later Terry Pelino '91 led an attack through the heart of the Army defense and then, with a nifty pass, hit a streaking Gulick who knocked a shot past Pellegrini for his second goal of the contest. At that point in the match Army finally settled down and managed to generate some offense of their own. The Bucknell defense seemed a little out of sync without the injured Chad Heilman '92, but keeper Scott Racek '91 made up the difference with an outstanding first half in which he had several fine saves. Pelino added some more insurance at 32:00 when he took a Gulick pass and hit a screamer into the Army net for a 3-0 halftime lead. Army's Branden Carteen broke up the shutout bid with a sec ond half goal past keeper Mark Wrigley '94, but the Bison defense tightened up and managed to hang on for the victory. ""It was a good win,"" indi cated Coach Reynolds, ""but I have some reservations because we were outplayed in the last 33 to 40 min utes. Our first half was good in that we had several opportunities to score, and we stuck it in the net"" Gulick, who scored his team leading sixth and seventh goals in the contest, as well as adding an assist, had this to say about his club's strong start this season: ""We've got a really good squad this year all the way up and down the field. We're strong at most every position, and we've got good team chemistry. Also, we've really come together as a unit this year."" The Bison hosted Towson State on Tuesday for a non conference game with their old ECC rivals. Pelino voiced the team's confusion and frustation with the 1-0 loss stating, ""It was a game where we played as well as we have all season, in fact, I think we dominated much of the contest."" ""We did a lot of things well, and it was actually one of our best totally complete games of the sea son,"" stated Reynolds. ""But, you've got to look at the wins and losses in this game."" Bucknell played an excep tional first half, and did everything they needed to do, except put the ball in the net. The Bison's best scoring opportunity came when Alex Kogan '94 took a shot that hit off the crossbar, and rebounded right back to Bucknell, but the team faltered in its second attempt as well. The second half opened and found itself being very similar to the first 45 minutes. With the wet grass, both teams found it difficult to make quick cuts and changes of direction, so the play was noticea bly slower. Both teams applied sub stantial pressure, but Bucknell had the best opportunities to score. Yet, on this day, some golden second half attempts by Brandon Poe '91, Kogan, and Dan D'Angelo '92 all found themselves just wide of the net. Frustration was evident on both sides as there was a lot of finger pointing, minor penalties, yellow cards, and bickering with the ref eree. Unfortunately, Towson took advantage of the frustrated Bison and found the opportunity they were looking for when the Buck- See MEN'S SOCCER, page 16 Mg #"

Field hockey thrashed by Penn State,
"after victories over Lehigh, LaSalle","By Scooter Van Kirk and Julie McCausland Staff Writers The field hockey team trav eled to Penn State yesterday, where it succumbed 9-0 to the Nittany Lions. Penn State, a national pow erhouse ranked #2 in the country, had little trouble with the Lady Bison. Bucknell drops to 3-9 this season, while Penn State raises its record to 10-1, with its only defeat coming to Old Dominion. This loss snapped the Lady Bison's two- game winning streak of the previ ous weekend, where they notched their first conference win. Few things could have gone wrong for the Lady Bison last weekend, as they defeated Lehigh and La Salle with a resurgent offensive effort supplemented by their ever-ready defense. On Satur day the Lady Bison rolled over Patriot League member Lehigh 3-1, notching their first league victory this season, as their record stands at 1-3 in the conference. Sunday the Lady Bison shutout a struggling La Salle team 1-0. In addition to these two wins, forward Almyra Baldwin '94 was named Patriot League Player of the Week for her impressive role in both wins. It was a long week for Buck nell, who weathered a twelve hour road-trip to Cornell just a day before the long weekend. At Cor nell the Lady Bison were forced to adjust their ranks due to the loss of key starters Meghan Clark '92 and speedy forward Alison Arth '93. Hie Lady Bison fell to the Big Red 2-0, but were undaunted as they came into their league game against Lehigh. Bucknell ended a three-week offensive drought with a barrage of shots on goal as well as many well- played opportunities. The multitude of shots, which resulted in the long sought goals, were generated by an attack which coach Averill termed ""remorseless."" The relentless Lady Bison notched 35 shots to their oppo nents' 16 and nearly doubled Lehigh's 7 offensive comers with 12 of their own. Bucknell's repeated offensive onslaughts resulted in two scores after shots were rebounded off the goalie. Early in the game a bee-line drive from Sue Wells '93 rebounded off the Lehigh goal- tender and was followed through by Stephanie Carfley '93 to put Bucknell on the scoreboard. Less than thirty seconds later, the Lehigh goalie was again beat by Wells. Wells collected her own rebound to score the second goal of the game for the Lady Bison. She assessed, ""Our offense didn't give them a rest, and that made all the difference today."" The aggressive play was still not over for the Bucknell attack, as Almira Baldwin scored giving the Lady Bison a three-goal advantage into halftime. Lehigh managed a goal in the last ten minutes of the second half from Laurie Leigh-Manuel. Except for this defensive lapse the Lady Bison played a solid game on both ends of the field. M l Once again the defense was anchored by stalwart goalie Danielle Ward '93, who recorded 15 saves in the contest. Bucknell's first shut-out of the season came against non conference foe LaSalle, who beat Bucknell last year by the same 1-0 score. The lone goal came from See FIELD HOCKEY, page 16 *"

Women's soccer crushes Temple,"By Anne Taback Staff Writer The soccer season is about half over, and Bucknell's Lady Bison celebrated with a smashing 10-3 win over the Temple Owls. The team has been steadily improv ing since its first game, and as a first year varsity squad, they have come a long way. Coach Toby Lovecchio is encouraged and optimistic about his team's success. ""We're at the point now where I thought we'd be and we've done pretty much what I thought we'd do in terms of work ing up to certain levels as time went on. Now we can really com pete against the teams we're up against"" He feels that everyone on the team has improved greatly, stating, ""In the beginning, we could hardly even head the ball, we weren't stringing together passes, we weren't playing good defense... from that first day everything has improved. The girls' confidence level has increased, we have a couple of wins, we've stayed in some games that we possibly could have won."" Lovecchio hopes (he team will stay at the level it is at and keep getting better. Lovecchio has been trying to teach them ""soccer sense,"" almost a sixth sense about what to do on the field that only comes from playing. ""The more they play, the more they'll get that soccer sense and the more they'll be able to do things on the field by second nature. You just know what to do and when to do it, to think before you get the ball... and when you do that and go up against a team that doesn't, you win. That's the difference when we go up against teams that are better than us--teams that were able to do things a lot smoother than we were able to do but we're getting there. The girls are great. Being the ener getic and hardworking group that they are, they're trying to do it... they're very coachable."" Obviously everyone's efforts are paying off. Although Temple is a club team and does not count in the standings, it was a big victory for the Lady Bison. The offense was extremely good, exploding for a total of 10 goals. The first goal of the game was scored by Bucknell at 2:00, when forward Tina Fields '94 was standing six yards away from the goal and, on a beautiful cross by midfielder Kathy Ott '91, put the ball in the back of the net with a header. Temple followed up with a quick goal at 3:00 after a scramble in front of the net. After a cross from midfielder Mandy Head '93, forward Amy Krause '91 gave Bucknell the lead once again at 7:35. However, Tem ple tied it up once again at 8:40 with a shot above the head of goal keeper Jessica Livingston '92. Midfielder Janine Hudson '92 scored the next goal for the Lady Bison at 15:15, and although Temple scored once more at 20:30, it was their last goal. Midfielder Alyssa Meade '91 converted on a pass from Hudson to score at 28:10 in the first half and midfielder Ou scored the next two goals assisted by Hudson and Fields. The Lady Bison continued their stampede after halftime, when they scored four more times. The sixth goal came at 55:15 when Fields took a shot which rebounded off the Temple goalkeeper and Krause was there to follow it up. Hudson scored the next goal unas sisted at 75:00. At 80:20, Head passed the ball to forward Chris O'Lare '92, who converted on the midfield pass for the ninth goal. The tenth and last goal of the game for the Lady Bison came with less than eight minutes left in the game when defender Nicola Stojak '92 crossed from the left to Meade, who took a shot about six yards out for the goal. Goalkeeper Livingston played an excellent game, compil ing nine saves. Livingston had pre viously decided that she wasn't happy playing soccer and that she was going to take a break from the team. Since both first and second string goalkeepers were injured, Lovecchio called her and asked if she would play in net against Tem ple. Livingston agreed, came to practice last Friday, and helped the Lady Bison get their victory. Lovecchio feels that as the game went on, the defense played tougher than in the beginning and that made all the difference. 'They played excellent soc-' cer in the last twenty minutes of the first half and the full forty five min utes in the second half. The big dif ference in the game was that we were in much better condition; our physical fitness was much better than theirs. We were stringing together passes, finalizing them with good opportunities and then converting those opportunities."" The Lady Bison are begin ning to play better as a team. 'The last two days of practice were the best I've seen all year,"" said Lovec chio. 'They're knocking the ball well, moving well, playing good, aggressive defense and I think their attitude is such that they're feeling better about themselves and it shows when they're on the field."" Hudson added, ""Up to this point our offense has been minimal, this time we scored a lot of goals. We seem more unified now than in the beginning of the season... we're becoming more of a team now. We're coming together and getting to know each other a lot better... it'll be a promising season next year. I'm optimistic, I think we'll come out with a decent season this year, though."" However, the loss of last Wednesday's game against Bloomsburg was disappointing. The Lady Bison played extremely well in the first 20 minutes. Early in the game, Krause took the ball from one of the defenders, passing it to Fields who rocketed an eight yard shot into the net. The Huskies retaliated, coun terattacking and finally tying the score with a comer kick that got past goalkeeper Stojak. The Lady Bison continued to play well in the second half, winning a lot of the 50- 50 balls and playing good defense. Unfortunately, Bloomsburg capitalized on a ball that hit a bump in the field and flew over one of the Bucknell defenders. The Lady Bison were unable to score after that and the final score of the game was 2-1. Hudson summarized it well, saying that ""we dominated most of the game, we just couldn't get it in the net as much as we needed to."" The last time they played Blooms burg, the Lady Bison were defeated 4-1, according to Lovecchio, ""it was a game we could have won. We played pretty good soccer."" Although it lost to Blooms burg, the team is keeping the Tem ple victory in mind and is looking forward to clashing with the Blue Jays tomorrow. Co-captain Christina Baselga '91 had to get stitches after getting hit in the face with the ball at Bloomsburg and will not play. Elizabethtown is a Division III powerhouse, ranked in the top 20 nationwide. However, Lovecchio is opti mistic about his team's success: ""I think we'll be ready for Elizabeth town,"" he said. ""If we can contain a couple of their key players we can play with them."""
(NCAA institutes new,
drug-testing policy,"By Mark Abrahamsen Staff Writer The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) has implemented a new drug-testing policy this fall requiring all Divi sion I football players to participate. Originally brought before NCAA legislation last January, the current policy states: 1) All Division I football playing schools will be tested; 2) A medical crew will be sent to each campus to conduct the testing; 3) AH costs will be covered by the NCAA; 4) A 48-hour notice will be given to each school prior to testing; 5) 36 student-athletes, selected at ran dom, will be tested initially; 6) Tests will be administered for possi ble steroids, diuretics, and ""urine manipulators""; 7) Any school may be tested more than once during the fall season. This new policy marks the first time that colleges may be tested during the regular season of a particular sport; testing has been administered by NCAA officials at various post-season cham pionship events in prior years. The passing of the issue has caused a controversy among col leges and universities across the nation. Bucknell belongs to a minority of Division I schools which oppose the new legislation, citing that the mandatory drug-testing infringes on Constitutional rights. Rick Hartzell, Bucknell director of athletics, said that the policy was ""personally demeaning and an invasion of privacy."" Hartzell also added that since Bucknell doesn't offer full athletic scholarships to students, the pressure to win at all costs here may not be quite as big as other schools. Most of the athletic departments in the Patriot and the Ivy Leagues share similar views regarding the issue, but a large major ity of NCAA universities in ""big-time"" conferences (e.g. Big-10, SEC, ACC, Big-8, Pac-10) favor the new policy. While public state schools would appear more apt to have drug problems within the athletic department than a school like Bucknell, the larger universi-"
I,"ties feel they need to support the drug-testing procedure so that, at"
I,"least on the surface, they have nothing to hide in their athletic programs. In today's world of intercollegiate athletics, sports are more of a business than just a game between individuals or teams. In the"
I,"1980's, scandals rocked universities from coast to coast, where the NCAA levied sanctions against schools in many different viola tions, primarily involving drug abuse and illegal recruiting. Okla homa, Florida, Southern Methodist, Oklahoma State, South Caro lina, Clemson: the list of sorry universities goes on and on. Even Notre Dame, a school thought of by many football fol lowers as the ""cleanest"" of any Top 25 national power, recently received an extreme amount of unfavorable publicity when a former Irish football player told Sports Illustrated in August that a consid erable number of Notre Dame players were consistently using ster oids, and that the Irish coaching staff encouraged players to take the performance-enhancing drug in order to increase body strength and bulk. Stanford is a school that joins Bucknell in its opposition of the NCAA's legislation. The NCAA News reported October 1 that ""NCAA-mandated drug tests for student-athletes at Stanford violate the California constitutional right of privacy, the California Court of Appeals said September 25 in upholding a lower-court decision."" The Stanford ruling may set a precedent for other adamantly opposed universities that wish to challenge the policy in court. Now that it is mid-October and half of the football season is over, Hartzell doubts that Bucknell will be tested this year. 'The NCAA has over 200 Division I and I-AA schools, and it would be nearly impossible for the investigators to get around to every one in the nation,"" explained Hartzell. A rumor floating around the sports offices is that Cornell is the only school from either the Ivy or Patriot League in which the NCAA has expressed an interest. But the Ithaca, New York, school has yet to be tested, and there is absolutely no sentiment that Cor nell would be involved in any sort of drug problem. With the crackdown on steroids and other drugs around cam puses the past few years, the NCAA does seem serious about ban ishing drugs from collegiate athletics. Hartzell believes the stricter laws have been effective, to a degree. ""I don't think steroid use was as rampant as it was a couple years ago,"" notes Hartzell. As for the future, one of two possible outcomes is bound to happen; either athletes will continue to use body-building drugs to"
I,"gain more strength and speed, as they will discover more ""masking"
I,"agents to foil the testing system, or more young competitors will realize that the short-term ""benefits"" of steroids aren't worth the negative long-term effects, and will discontinue using any sort of"
I,"drugs. Hartzell witnesses, ""I think most people have the right mis sion in mind then they work with college athletics. They want to help people succeed, grow, and mature. I believe with all the scan dals people are realizing drug use is not something that's helpful in the long run.""

All-Blacks capture season's first victory,"By Mitch Benton and Mark Spina Bucknell's men's rugby club traveled to Lancaster to take on Franklin & Marshall Saturday, look ing for its first victory of the young season. The All-Blacks squandered a sixteen point first half lead two weeks ago, and fell to East Strouds burg, 20-16. They met with more disappointment the following week, as a late penalty kick sailed wide of the goalpost and the team was forced to settle for a 6-6 tie with Millersville. As Buckneli entered the game, the All-Blacks knew that the key to success would be to eliminate the sloppy play that had plauged them throughout the earlier matches. However the trend continued early, as a number of miscues almost lead to an F & M score. It was at this point that Buck neli righted themselves with a num ber of long runs that brought the ball into the Diplomat half, where it remained for most of the period. These runs included a scramble from outside center Mark Spina '92, who took a pass from the scrumhalf, Dave Keim '91, at the 22-meter line and raced in for the try. The successful two-point conversion kick by Howie Fetzer '93 gave the All-Blacks a 6-0 lead. Fetzer then closed the first half scoring with a late penalty kick to give the squad a 9-0 advantage. Franklin & Marshall opened the second half inspired, as their pack drove over the try line for an early score. The conversion failed, leaving the All-Blacks lead at 9-4. At this point it appeared as though Buckneli was ready for another one of the second half letdowns that had haunted them all season. However the squad's deter mination was echoed by team co captain Kaim's statement after the game, ""We could have let their- score get us down, instead we got fired up and controlled the rest of the game."" Keim led the ensuing charge with a 15 meter run into the try zone and with Fetzer's kick, the score stood at 15-4. The final Buckneli try came as the pack, led by second row Chip Bousum '91 and prop Chuck Gabler '92, forced Franklin & Marshall into their zone, where the duo col lapsed on the ball for the score. The conversion was unsuccessful, and the final score was 19-4. When asked afterward about the keys to the victory, co captain Bousum said, ""Although I don't think we played our best today, it was an encouraging game. The team played well and really came together after their score. I was mostly impressed by the play of the pack, who won the ball often and got it out to the backs."" This pack play was led by the strong techniques and tackling of second row Steve Dowart '91 and prop Matt Minnick '93. The All-Blacks look to continue their winning ways against a strong squad from West Chester, behind the mods, Saturday at 11 a. m. Allison Zadroga/The Bucknellian Steve Dowart '91 leaps above the pack in order to grab the ball for the All-Blacks during the squad's 19-4 victory over Franklin and Marshall last Saturday."
Field Hockey,"From page 15 Baldwin off an assist by midfielder Dana Bruce '92. On the penalty comer play, which coach Averill had ""networked"" in practice, Bald win lifted the ball in a high arc over the heads of all players, including the dumbfounded LaSalle goalie, for the winning goal. Baldwin, as a first year player, packs a wallop which belies her size, and plays with the calm, collected style of a player beyond her years. She is Bucknell's first field hockey Player of the Week in the newly-formed Patriot League. Coach Averill commented, ""We were tired from a long week but still played a heads-up game with consistency from all players on the field."" Averill went to her bench to give some of the under classmen, who have not seen much time this year, some experience in the game. This next week should be entitled ""The week of the old E.C.C. rivals,"" owing to the fact that the Bison face former rivals Drexel and Towson State. Tomor row the Bison will host Drexel at 1 p.m. at Buckneli. Co-captain Aurand said, ""Drexel will be up this weekend and it looks as though there'll be a good fight."""

Unfortunately, time ran out on the Bison, and they lost a game in which they had clearly outplayed their opponent. 'The bottom line in this game is taking advantage of your oppo nent,"" said Reynolds. ""You have to finish off a score when you have the chance to score and we didn't that game. But the team shouldn't get down about this one. Keith Goodling ['92], Brandon Poe, Evan Goldsmith ['92], and Kirk Lorie t*91] did a very good job on a couple of tough Towson strikers. We played like a good ball club except for scoring goals."" The toughest part of the sea son lies still down the road for the Bison, and includes a crucial game tomorrow at Lafayette. ""We played a sloppy game against them last year, but I don't anticipate such this seaon."" said Reynolds. 'They're a real solid ball club and I'm amazed they beat Fordham, who is the class of the league this year."" Buckneli (3-1 in the Patriot League) can control their own des tiny and get into the league playoffs with wins over Lafayette (2-1) and Fordham (2-1) on October 20. With six regular season games left, there is a wide-open race for the Patriot League title. ""We don't even have a .500 record wrapped up yet,"" indicated Reynolds. ""Our season is just get ting underway right now."""

Fearless,
NHL,
predictions,"By Mark Griffith and Eric Smith Staff Writers In the 1980 s, the National Hockey League belonged to the Islanders and Oilers, or so it seemed. Why did die other nineteen teams even bother playing considering that only two other teams man aged to wrestle Lord Stanley's Cup away from the dual dynasty? But last Thursday, the 1990 NHL season opened and a flurry of new talent could make the 1990's the decade of perhaps...the Buffalo Sabres? Or could it be that the ""1940"" chant that has rocked The Nassau Coli seum during Islander-Ranger brawls will soon be obsolete? Far fetched as it may seem, these are just two of the teams that see the entrance to the Nineties as a ticket to hockey fame. Below we give our predictions for teams we expect to see life in hockey s second season, listed in order of projected finish. Patrick Division Late-season acquisitions of Bemie Nichols and Mike Gartner make the New York Rangers one of the biggest offensive threats in the league. The Rangers also offer a very strong game in net with John Vanbiesbrouck, Mike Richter, and newly acquired Mark LaForest. Barring injuries to its top guns, this team should not be threatened by the rest of the division. The New Jersey Devils have a healthy mix of veterans and youth, helped by last year's trade for Peter Stasny. The Devils, though, will need a better performance from team captain Kirk Muller, as well as from Soviet defehseman Viacheslav Fetisov to make a run at first place. Another second place finish for New Jersey is in the cards for 1990-91. The Washington Capitals shocked many fans last season with their play-off performance, eliminating both the Rangers and the Devils. The style of play was characterized by impec cable defense. Unfortunately, Scott Stevens, a cornerstone of the Washington defense is gone, and third place will be an accomplish ment Pat LaFontaine is the only reason why the New York Islanders will squeak into the fourth position in the Patrick Division (if you don't count the fact that Mario Lemieux will be out of a Pittsburgh Pengu ns uniform for at least two months). Adams Division If the Buffalo Sabres impressed you last year, now add former Winnipeg standout Dale Hawerchuk to the likes of 40-goal scorers Pierre Turgeon and Dave Andreychuk. The Buffalo defense is strong and Darren Pupa is one of the league's best in goal. It could be a ban ner year in Buffalo. The Boston Bruins come off a season with a league high 101 points. This team has many weapons to work with, such as 50-goal scorer Cam Neely. The Boston defense, led by Ray Bourque, gave up the fewest goals in the league last year, and can be expected to be equally tough this year. The addition of Denis Savard to the Montreal Canadiens make the Habs another legitimate con tender for the Adams crown. But without Chris Chelios, the defense cannot stand up to the Sabres and Bruins. As luck would have it, the Hartford Whalers will easily back into the play-offs, considering the Quebec Nordiques managed only 12 wins all of last season. Still, Hartford is no push-over and players such as Ron Francis and Pat Ver- beek will make this team interesting to watch. Norris Division Brett Hull has turned the St. Louis Blues into Stanley Cup contenders. His 72-goal season last year will be tough to match, but off-season acquisitions of Scott Stevens and Geoff Cornwall give the Blues the depth they need to take top honors in the Norris. The Chi cago Blackhawks, minus Denis Savard, are still a team to reckon with. In order for success to come Chicago's way, Adam Creighton and Greg Larmer need to pick up the slack of the departed Savard. With Mario Lemieux out at the start of the season, and an aging Wayne Gretzky easing his output, could the player of 1990 be the Detroit Red Wings' Steve Yzerman? The play of this man will lift Detroit out of the Norris cellar into the play-offs once again. The play of the Toronto Maple Leafs last season can be described as one-sided. The offense attacked opposing defenses scoring 337 goals last season, third high est in the league. Unfortunately, Toronto gave up 358 goals, also third highest. A rough style of play should make the Leafs play-off bound again. Smythe Division In the most competitive division in hockey, the Edmonton Oil ers should once again reign supreme. Edmonton has five players who scored 30+ goals last year. The defense is questionable, though, and could open the door for other Smythe hopefuls in the chase for the division crown. The Los Angeles Kings are running out of time to convert the Gretzky Deal into a Stanley Cup, as was predicted. The addition of Tomas Sandstrom, along with Luc Robitaille make the Kings an offensive threat, but a lack of defense will haunt the Kings again. Giving up 337 goals last season leaves much for improvement. One of the league's more surprising team's this year could be the Winnipeg Jets. The addition of Phil Howsley should make up for the loss of Dale Hawerchuk, whose attitude had been sliding in recent times. More offensive production will be needed, especially from Tomas Steen (only 18 goals scored last year) to help the Jets over come the Oilers. What happened to the 1989 -Stanley Cup Champions, the Calgary Flames? Firing their head coach upon elimination from last year's tournament was not the answer, but possibly the start of their problems. Though still a quality team, the Flames will be victi mized by a strong division and will have to settle for a fourth place finish."

Golf concludes fall,
on disappointing note,
Cross-country teams,
race to easy victory,"By Jamie Diaferia Staff Writer The golf team finished its season this past week by participat ing in the ECAC Qualifier on Thursday, October 4, as well as the Norstar Bank Classic on Tuesday, October 9. The results for the two tour naments were fairly unimpressive, as the average score for the team on both days was an 89. Coach Tommy Thompson remained extremely optimistic despite the setback, explaining that he feels the play of the last half of the season is not a fair representa tion of the team he expects to see in the spring. The ECAC Qualifier was held on Thursday, despite heavy periods of rain and wind. These poor course conditions, coupled with a lack of practice the week before combined to crush the team's hopes of qualifying for the ECAC Fall tournament. Don Hansen '94 led the team with an 85, followed by captain Mike Smigie '91 and Scott Miller '93 with 87 and 89 respectively. Doug Dollenberg '94 and Dave Fries '93 rounded out the bottom with a 91. The team shot a combined 352, while the winning team shot 312, a fairly high score for a win ning team. While the players refuse to blame the weather, they did speculate that the lack of practice was the major reason for their poor play. The team did not fare much better in the Norstar tournament, as they finished seventh in an eight- team field. Once again the condi tions were poor, as it rained for much of the day. The course was an especially By Todd Bianchine Staff Writer The women's volleyball team's losing streak reached six last weekend, as the Lady Bison lost two more matches, dropping their overall record to 2-11. Buckneli squared off against Big East power, Seton Hall, in the first match, and dropped three straight games to the Lady Pirates by the scores of 15-3, 15-12, and 15-0. The Lady Bison's hard luck didn't end their, as the lost three straight to Columbia 15-3,15-5, 15- 8 . Buckneli tried using its new 6-2 offense (6 hitters and 2 servers) against Seton Hall, and it worked for a while as Buckneli put together a balanced offensive attack, scoring 12 points in the second game. However, the Lady Pirates were just too tough on defense in the end, as they totally shut down the 6-2 attack, allowing no points in the entire third game. Co-captain Kris Colbert '91 had one of the bet ter performances for the Lady Bison recording 3 kills, 5 solo blocks, and had a hitting percentage of .200. ""I think the (6-2) offense is working much better now,"" said setter Dee Scinta '92. ""Mary (Jor dan '93) is becoming more comfort able with the position, and it just adds more height to our front line, because she is up there for three rotations. It has raised our level of difficult one, as it was used in 1989 for the U.S. Open where it pro duced fairly high scores. Hansen led the team once again with an 82, and Fries was the only other player to record a score below 90, as he shot an 86. Miller, Smigie, and Howie Livingston '93, playing for Dollenberg, all shot in the 90's, recording scores of 90,93, and 99 respectively. The team shot a combined 351, while the winner shot a 319. The conditions clearly were a major factor in the poor results, however, as quality teams such as Cornell and Princeton each shot 341. Coach Thompson chose to ignore the events of the past week, as he noted that they were clearly not the same team as they were in the beginning of the year. ""I'm dis appointed,"" he said, ""but not dis couraged. We played some good tournaments early on, especially the Georgetown tournament"" It was in the Georgetown tournament that the team averaged 80 strokes per person to finish tenth. Referring to the lack of prac tice time, Thompson remarked that, for various reasons, there just wasn't enough time to play as much as they wanted. He feels, however, that there is no reason to look negatively on the season. ""I prefer to remain an optimist,"" he stated. ""I'm very pleased with our two freshmen, Hansen and Dollenberg. They are as good as any two freshmen I've seen in ten years."" As for the spring season, Thompson remarked, ""We just have to look for consistency. I would like to see four good scores each time out. If we can do that, we'U be a viable team. I've seen them do it before."" play, so now we just have to go out there and win one."" Bucknell's woes continued against Ivy League rival Columbia as well. The Lady Lions jumped all over Buckneli in the first two games of the match allowing the Lady Bison only eight total points. In the third game Buckneli jumped out to a 6-0 lead, but Columbia mounted a strong comeback, allow ing the Lady Bison only two more points in the remainder of the game. Co-captains Kara Forosisky '92 and Colbert each had six kills, and substitute hitter Meg Kinney '92, who has seen a lot of action lately, had six kills of her own. Buckneli will have a chance to better its record this weekend as it will host St. Francics and LaSalle on Saturday. The team will take on LaSalle at 10 a.m. and St. Francis at 2 p.m. The Lady Bison have already beaten St Francis twice this year. ""Right now we just have to go out there and challenge our selves,"" said Coach Cindy Opalski. ""We've been a little frustrated lately because we know we should be competitive. Our attitude has been great and we just have to treat the rest of the season as an entire new season and forget about our record."" ""We can all feel it,"" said Kinney, ""we're right on the verge of breaking out of this losing streak."" By Jennifer Walsh Staff Writer Both the Buckneli men's and women's cross-country teams cruised to victory this past week end, with the women outrunning teams from Kutztown, UMBC, Springfield, and Onconta, while the men rowdily defeated both Drexel and the University of Delaware. The men ran, according to coach Art Gulder, a very straight forward race with little worry of a negative outcome. And, as expected, the Bison dominated. With the exception of Drexel's Kevin Cooke, who placed first overall, the Buckneli runners, ten of them, all finished tied for second place, in a time of 28:28. ""Last week, I said this race would be a jog in the park for us, and that's really what it was,"" said Gulden. ""We ran the first three miles pretty hard, then backed off on the last two and jogged. The goal of those meets is to win the team competition, not to worry about times."" As a sidenote, Gulden remarked that U-Conn, one of the two teams that has defeated Buck neli, defeated Providence this past weekend, now showing just how good they really are. ""So the two teams we got beat by (U-Conn and Pitt) are ranked in the top twenty in the nation,"" Gulden commented. The next meet for the men will be a pre-NCAA meet on Mon day, October 15, on the same course where the NCAA meet will be held later on in the season. And for this reason, Buckneli anticipates tough competition. ""A lot of the teams that are planning to run in the NCAA meet will be there next week to get used to the course,"" said Gulden. The men scored a total of twenty points, while Drexel and the University of Delaware scored 43 and 50 points, respectively. The women also crushed the competition they raced in the Hunter Invitational on October 5, a day before the men. Kelly March, Kristen Opdyke and Helene Wiet- ing completed a sweep of first, sec ond, and third place, in that order, while Buckneli totaled just twenty points altogether. Kutztown followed at a dis tance in the scoring with 103 points, UMBC came next with 107 followed by Springfield with 110, and placing last was Onconta, with 132 points. However, the lack of tough competition came as a surprise to the Buckneli women and their coach. Gulden remarked, ""We were disappointed that some teams didn't come, but still we ran strong, and ran a lot more aggressively, and of course it was good to get Kelly (Marsh) back from her sickness."" The coach also noted that he is seeing the improvement that he feels is paramount to the team's success later on in the season. This is an excellent sign for the women, who will not race again for three more weeks. Their next meet is October 27 at the Patriot League. ""There should be no adverse effects that we don't have another meet for three weeks, because rac ing's not the important thing, train ing is,"" Gulden responded to the question of whether or not his team would be at a disadvantage by not racing for so long. ""We're geuing better,"" he said, ""now we just need to put it all together at the Patriot League."""

Football tramples Towson St. 55-26,
Bison surge to best start since 1972 with fourth-straight victory,"By Scott Brown Staff Writer The superlatives keep rolling for the Bucknell football team this year as the Bison reach the half way point of the season. The team is off to its best start since 1972 and the wins are coming in dra matic fashion. With the 55-26 win over Towson State this past weekend the Bison have become the first team at Bucknell to have three suc cessive forty-point games since 1951 behind the offensive leader ship of quarterback Todd Hatajik '91. Hatajik entered the game as the nation's second leading passer in Division I-AA. Against Towson, he passed for a career high 254 yards on 14-21 passes with two touchdowns and one interception, his first in three weeks. Bucknell dominated every facet of the Towson game as they set a school record for first downs with 33 while holding the ball for almost 39 minutes of the game. They outrushed the Tigers 309 yards to 107, and outpassed them 259 yards to just 169. The rushing total was the highest for the Bison in ten years. Coach Lou Maranzana attrib uted this success to several factors. ""The offensive line is first. They have been working hard together for a while, now that most are sen iors. They take pride in what they do. [Craig] Cavlovic '91 helps in the back because he is physical and determined. The tailbacks are doing well. [Brian] Henesey '92 is having a great year and Matt Walsh '93 is a really good player. Kevin McElvene '93 is just wait ing for his chance."" The offense showed their complete dominance in converting 9 of their eleven pos sessions for the game. The tone o f the game was set early as Towson's initial drive was unsuccessful because of a dropped pass that would have been a sure touchdown. Bucknell took over after Towson was unable to convert a fourth down and eleven. Hatajik started the drive with a 15-yard completion to Cavlovic. After four straight rushes by Henesey and an incomplete pass, Hatajik connected to Dan Scocca '91 who made an acrobatic grab for a 41-yard gain down to the two yard line. On the next play, Henesey rushed into the cndzone for the 7-0 early lead. On the next series, the special teams got into the act when Eric Jantzi '91 slipped though the line and blocked a punt. He recovered the loose ball and scampered 25 yards into the endzone to make the score 14-0. Bucknell's defense stopped the Tiger's flat offense on the next series and received the punt on their own 21. Twelve plays later the Bison were again in the end- zone as Walsh broke a tackle and carried the ball the 12 yards for the score. This touchdown brought the score to 21-0 and the rout was on. The drive was highlighted by two runs of 18 and 16 yards by Henesey and a 14-yard pass from Hatajik to Je ff Pape '92. The second quarter began with a Towson punt. Bucknell took the ball and began to drive follow ing a 22-yard pass from Hatajik to Lester Erb '91, but on Hatajik's next pass, he threw an interception as he was heavily rushed. The ball was returned to the Bucknell 17. Two plays later Chris Goetz con nected with Dewey Barnes on a pass that brought the ball down to the one-yard line. It took the Tigers three attempts but they finally put the ball in on a carry by Jarrett Grier. Bucknell continued with the pressure as soon as they got posses sion of the ball. In 9 plays covering 76 yards, the Bison scored on Hene- sey's second rushing touchdown of the day, an 11 yard scamper up the middle. It was his third touchdown of the season. The drive consisted of 3-3 passing by Hatajik for 40 yards. Four plays after that score, the Bison ifetained possession as Trevor Smith '91 thwarted the Tiger drive with his team-leading fourth inter ception of the season. Led by the passing o f Hatajik, the team drove down the field using the clock effectively. Hatajik completed a 14- yarder to Erb and then a 27-yard pass to Pape. Maranzana called timeout with 38 seconds remaining in the half, and the Bison punched the ball in the remaining two yards on a pass play from Hatajik to Pape. The half ended with the Bison in from 35-6. Bucknell had already accumulated 303 total yards includ ing 184 yards in the air on 11 of 14 passing. Henesey led all rushers with 71 yards on the ground. "" We played better than we've played all year. It was the best first half we have played defensively,"" stated Coach Maranzana. Bucknell began right where they left o ff after receiving the ini tial kick. Cavlovic ran for 19 yards on two carries and caught a pass for another 14 yards. Hatajik then kept the ball on a quarterback option, and raced for ten yards. This was as far as Bucknell could progress and they were forced to kick. The result was a 47-yard field goal for Todd -- **- * *"

Tennis enjoys 3-0 w eek,"By Kym m Carlson and Christopher Mosunic Staff Writer The women's tennis team continued its winning streak last week with relative ease, defeating Colgate, Hofstra and Shippensburg behind a winning attitude. Last Saturday Bucknell defeated one of its more formidable opponents, Colgate, 6-3. After the Red Raiders defeated the Lady Bison on many previous occasions, Bucknell was ready to return the favor. Karen Stagliano '92, Steph- anie Ryer '92, and Kymm Carlson '94 all breezed to victory in each of their singles matches. Elizabeth Murphy '94 made her first singles appearance as the Lady Bison's sixth-seed, and was triumphant in her debut. Murphy commented, "" I was really pumped to play and there was no way I was going to let down my teammates in an important match like this one against Colgate."" In doubles play, Kim Thomp son '93 and Carlson topped their opponents 6-4, 6-1. Mary Ann Benack '92 and Stagliano were > deafeated, while Ryer and Jennifer W yckoff '92 won in three hard- fought sets. The Lady Bison traveled to Hofstra the following day and crushed the Flying Dutchwomen 9-0. Benack, who has played many tough matches this year, once again provided the most exciting action o f the day. Benack, the Lady Bison's #1 singles player, struggled at the outset o f the match against Hofstra's top seed, losing See T E N N IS, page 16 r * * I L A y"

Henesey led the Bison rushing attack with 115 yards on 19 carries. Krutehkoff '91. It was his longest career field goal and his fifth straight for the season. Towson came back with a touchdown o f their own but again failed the conversion resulting in a 38-12 score. Bucknell, though, came right back as they drove 74 yards for the touchdown. The touchdown was scored on a 42- yard bomb from Hatajik to Erb. ""Lester's catch was just a play action pass where he got inside the safety. They made a mis take. He ran a good pattern,"" com mented Maranzana. For the day Erb caught four passes for 92 yards. For the season, he has 21 receptions for 359 yards, and a 17.1 yard average, all three team-highs. The highlight of the drive was a personal foul committed by Towson that gave the Bison a first down instead of having to punt on fourth and 20. Bucknell scored again in the third quarter on a 41-yard field goal by Dan Levine '93, his first ever at the varsity level. This was set up by a powerful 19-yard run by Hene sey. That rush put him over the 100 yard mark for the third time this season. It gave him 115 yards for the day. For the season he has amassed 527 yards on 105 carries, for over five yards a carry. He is averaging over 105 yards a game, a pace which, if continued, would place him well over the 1,000 yard mark for the season. Bucknell got the ball back again after another Towson State touchdown and missed conversion. They raced 52 yards down the field culminating the 9 play drive with a 13-yard touchdown run by Jeff Wall '93, his second of the season. This final carry was set up by two runs of 14 and 19 yards by McElvene. This put the score at 55- 18 before Towson scored again 54 seconds later. The Tigers converted on the two-point attempt leaving the score at 55-26. Bucknell then ran out the remaining 7:47 of the game on their last possession. Bucknell hosts the Princeton Tigers tomorrow during Parents Weekend. It will be the team's third contest against an Ivy League opponent this year. The Bison won easily in their previous two games against both Columbia and Cornell. Last year, the Bison were 2-2 ver sus the Ivy League. Princeton is coming off a 27- 23 win over Brown last week. Overall Princeton is 2-2, 1-1 in the Ivy League. Commenting on the Princeton game, Maranzana explained, 'They got beat their first game of the season, like us, and have gotten better. The other loss was to Colgate at home and Col gate's tough. They lost Judd Garrett, prob ably the best player in the Ivy League the last five years. The team is developing a new personal ity without him. They have a good quarterback and a good tailback. They have big people that are prob ably the best athletes as a group we've played."""
Water polo goes 2-1,
in Fordham Tourney,"By Scott Pollins Staff Writer Last weekend, Bucknell's water polo team traveled to Ford- ham University for the first of two league tournaments. The Bison had a good solid weekend, turning in fine performances against rival Mid-Atlantic Conference squads. Bucknell's first game was against perennial foe Slippery Rock. Both teams played an extremely even and tough game, putting the game into overtime. Slippery Rock eventually edged Bucknell in an exciting double overtime game, 13-11. Danny Brown '93 and Walter Kelly '92 led Bucknell with 4 and 3 goals respectively. John Bradbury '92 played an outstanding game in goal, registering 21 saves. Coach Lynn Kachmarick stressed that ""the guys played very tough."" The Bison next faced a strong Princeton squad. The Tigers were coming off a big upset victory over Iona on Friday night, so Bucknell was anticipating a great game. As expected, both teams played tre mendous defense. The score was deadlocked at 6-6 after regulation, forcing the game into overtime. After two intense overtime periods, the score was still tied at 6-6. It took two sud den death periods before captain John Zeigler '91 put away the win ning goal. Again Brown and Kelly led the Bison with 4 and 3 goals respectively. Veterans Zeigler and Mead Briggs '91 played strong defense, while goalie Bradbury had another great game in the goal. Bucknell's final game was against Queens University. The first half was close, ending with the Bison leading a tight contest 8-6. The Bison exploded in the second half, and pulled away win ning 17-9. Leading the surge was Kelly, who netted 4 goals in third quarter alone, en route to a 5 goal performance. Zeigler and Kevin Schroth '92 contributed 4 goals each. Brown also registered 3 scores. Coach Kachmarick main tained that her squad had ""a good solid weekend."" This weekend, the Bison will be without their coach. Kachmarick will be traveling to Budapest, Hun gary to play with the Women's National Water Polo Squad. Assist ant coach Jim Harvey '89 will take over the squad when the team trav els to M IT in Cambridge, Massa chusetts for an Eastern Water Polo Association tournament.

Colgate adopts similar,
social-residential plan,"Courtesy of University Archives Bucknellians enjoy Homecoming festivities in 1948. The freshman pole climb entertained upperclass men and alumni alike. By Lisa Hirschkorn Staff Writer The president of Colgate's Inter-fraternity Council, Jamie Lane, knows about the effort to eliminate the Greek system-- first hand. ""It is indicative of what's happening across the country,"" said Lane. On September 22, the Col gate trustee's recommendations to their Residential Life were approved. Similar to Bucknell, residen tial life at Colgate is in the process of evolution. The similarities between the universities focus on the central role of Greek life. Col gate is a small liberal arts college which maintains a predominantly Greek history. With nine fraterni ties and five sororities, approxi mately 55% of men and 45% of women are Greek. Last spring, however, Colgate's faculty brought the status quo into question. The faculty recommended that the Greek system be abolished by the fall of 1994. The course of Colgate's reforms recalls the diagrams that President Sojka presented in the Weis Center last spring. In Buck- nell's case, the Greek review pro ceeded from the Greek Review Committee (1988-1989) to the faculty motion (1989). After the G R C 's findings, the Faculty vetoed the Greek system, and Sojka made his recommendations to the trus tees (May 1). With the Trustee Implementation Program (TIP) the recommendations will be effective for the 1991-1992 academic year. 'The vast majority of com mittees in TIP are made up of stu dents,"" according to Gerry Com- merford, dean of Residential Life. Commerford explained ""our model was influenced by twenty-eight institutions that we corresponded with last January."" Residential Life based their modifications on meet ings and conversations with admin istrations and students at other uni versities. ""W e're influenced by other institutions, so it lends us to believe that other universities are influenced by us,"" Commerford added. At Colgate, the Greek Review Committee was called the Special Committee of Residential Life and was composed of eight trustees. Following the faculty motion (Spring 1989), the Special Committee studied the residential life system for over a year. Accord ing to IFC President Jamie Lane '91, Colgate has an implementation committee which represents the whole university: students, alumni, parents, faculty, and administration. ""There is potential for things to be worse but there is mixed reaction about specific policies."" Lane said, "" ...the 'no pledging' policy and the new bid rules are in conflict with national policies."" "" After talking with national presidents this week, I don't know how things are going to exist with the University guidelines,"" Lane said. Because the University's guidelines are in conflict with the national rules, Colgate's fraternities will have two choices. Lane explained that either fraternities can See C O L G A T E , page 6 Gary Sojka Larry Shinn Thomas Greaves Graphic by Brian Davlson/The Bucknellian The Bucknellian polled sophomores, juniors, and seniors on their opinions of the administration and Buck nell. Administrators were rated from 1 to 10. See related story and other charts on page 3."
Morale problems persist,
Administration seeking solutions,"By Tommy Abel Staff Writer The issue of low student morale has again come to the fore front as students passed out a leaf let condemning the university at the football game against Princeton on Saturday, October 13. The leaflet focused on the perception that "" Bucknell Univer sity is using a double standard to manipulate the students into giving up their basic rights as American citizens."" This perception stems from the fact that the university is exempt from abiding by Constitu tional restrictions in its enforce ment of the laws of the state of Pennsylvania, namely Act 31, since it is a private institution. The leaflet asks, "" Why is the University following the law of the State in the case of Act 31? How can it claim that it can ignore cer tain laws in order to enforce others? This is a blatantly abusive system where those in charge of enforcing the law don't have to answer to it."" Additionally the authors of the leaflet chastised the university's ""diminishing respect for auton omy."" The leaflet asked people to ""Consider the scope of the adminis tration's authority over our lives... It tells us: 1) when gathering we must inform them (registered party); 2) to limit how many of us gather (invite lists); 3) to limit when and how often we gather (limiting the number of social func tions); 4) we must segregate our selves by age or class (twenty-one- year-old sections, restriction of interaction with freshmen). We allowed ourselves to be subject to: 5) routine and uncalled-for security raids (thanks, but if there is trouble we will call); 6) random room searches without reasonable suspi cion (whether a door is open or closed)."" The leaflet symbolized "" frus tration because we don't know what to do because usual student channels have been totally ignored,"" according to an author of the leaflet. The leaflet summarized this sentiment when it explained, ""The nature of this document is reactionary and not radical."" One of the authors of the lcaf- let explained that ""our ultimate goal is to exert as much pressure on the administration and trustees because it seems that they mold our lives at Bucknell virtually unchecked by what we think. We want to prevent that, we need to prevent that from happening if we are to truly develop as individuals, rather than having the administra tion 'develop' us."" Student sentiment confirms that the issues raised in the pet'tion are indeed troubling to the student body. Senior Rob Hess has noticed the languishing state of morale across the board. "" Moral on cam pus is probably the lowest it's ever been. I'm a third brother that has come to Bucknell, so I've encoun tered the B.U. experience since 1983 through my brothers being here and it hasn't been until recently, my sophomore year, that I've seen a slow decrease in the basic social atmosphere at Bucknell."" Students frequently complain about the lack of social opportuni ties at Bucknell and the lack of "" respect for our rights,"" according See M O R A L E , page 2"
Sojka assesses Bucknell,"By Andrew Cohen Staff Writer ""These are not easy times. My opening statement in the uni versity's annual report is a little gloomy. I'm announcing, as I think most of the trustees already know, that this is an extraordinarily diffi cult period in American higher edu cation."" The position of America's universities is becoming exceed ingly problematic, according to President Sojka. One such problem facing Bucknell is that of decreased morale. Sojka acknowledges as recent student sentiment clearly shows that ""there is a major morale prob lem."" In trying to pinpoint the cause of this problem Sojka cited several ""contributing factors,"" among them: the fact that the Bison has not been completed, therefore limiting social possibilities; the abundance of fraternities that were on probation earlier in the semester which ""deprived the campus of a place to go and things to do"" ; and finally, student unrest as to the enforcement policies of security. Sojka crystallized the problem when he explained that ""people just sense there's an awful lot of change going on."" Sojka sees the changes that are taking place at Bucknell as part of a national movement in which "" [the pendulum] would swing back a little bit."" He stressed that this is, in fact, a problem that is not limited to Bucknell. ""Exactly what's been going on here has been going on at Lafayette."" According to Sojka, the reason for the unrest everywhere is that "" we're in a national and partic ularly a Pennsylvania period when life in college is not going to be what it was, and nobody who's going through it is going to like it."" Among those who do not like it is Sojka himself. The idealism that Sojka brought into the presi dency has been twisted due to external circumstances. ""I came to a school that I thought was a lot like the place where I was an undergraduate, and I really like undergraduates. I wanted to be the"

I really work at that, and the world hasn't been very kind to some who wanted to be in that mode. It has forced us into stuff we're not enjoying."" This role seems especially troubling for Sojka because he gen uinely enjoys interacting with stu dents. After several meetings with student groups to discuss the morale problem Sojka said, "" I wish See S O JK A , page 2 Colin Bridgewater/The Bucknellian President Sojka is facing one of toughest tests of his term, as student morale drops."

Administration receives mid-term grades,"Survey Analysis By Brian Davison Staff Writer With all of the professed unrest among the students, The Bucknellian decided to ask students their opinions on top administrators and on Bucknell in general, right now, and what they thought of Bucknell a year ago. Two weeks ago The Bucknel lian sent a direct mail survey to a total of 288 students in the sopho more, junior, and senior classes. Slightly over 11% were returned. The survey results, while not surprising, show some of the administration as doing an above average job, and others not doing as well. In addition, some adminis trators, namely. Vice-president Shinn, Vice-president Greaves, and Vice-president Maxwell had a large percentage of students who did not have an opinion, showing, as one student remarked, 'This reflects my awareness of their jobs and accomplishments."" Overall opinions of Bucknell have declined, both among greeks"
Opinion of Bucknell by affiliation!,I  Last year # This year
Greek,"and independents. ""The social life/ scene at Bucknell has definitely gone downhill and due to that stu dent attitude and morale has also gone down. Bucknell has recently turned into a soft of 'suitcase school' where everyone travels in order to have fun, or just hang out. Security has been so strict lately"
Independent,"Graphics by Brian Davison/The Bucknellian agrees with the social changes, say ing that she feels ""that security this year has taken away our freedom. I feel that I am always doing some thing I shouldn't even when I'm completely innocent. I also feel that my privacy is not important If they can walk into anywhere without permission, will they walk into my room too?"" A senior expanded on the notion of a ""suitcase school"" saying that ""college students need a release from studies, especially at such a demanding institution. Thus, if it is a hassle to relax and/or have any sort of fun, they will go else where. This is clearly occuring at this campus, as all one needs to do is look at the empty spaces in park ing lots on the weekends of resi dence halls and fraternities."" One student predicts, ""In a couple of years, the way things are going, this campus will be non- Greek, dry, and even more boring than it is now."" Comments a senior, ""The point is that, due to the administration's negative auitude toward [the students], a bitter atti tude is forming. If the university does not rid itself of the bureau cratic bison droppings, it is going to see a change in its student popu lation. I for one do not want to see that change. Until Bucknell allows us to be casual and gives us credit for being free-thinking, young adults, the administration is only going to promote bitterness and frustration. They will certainly not achieve a state in which the princi ples they seek are achieved."" that even if you're not drinking and just hanging out with your friends, you're still apt to have the gather ing broken up. Students are getting so frustrated that they're ready to take violent measures that will not be beneficial or even wise for stu dents or the administration."" com mented a sophomore. Another"

The genesis of a policy,
Legal basis of the alchol policy explained...,"By David Murray Staff Writer Many students are asking questions these days about our alcohol policy, and how it's enforced. They wonder who -- -- -- created the policy, N e w s what it has to do with A n a ly s is Pennsylvania Act 31, _ _ _ _ _  and when it will change again. Students also won der why it seems so ""harsh."" It turns out that the policy is a creation primarily of General Counsel and Secretary of the Uni versity Elias Abelson, with some input from John Dunlop, dean of students, and Timothy Murrell, for mer director of security and safety. It also turns out that our pol icy is a direct result of Act 31, and that its intention is to provide a recourse for the University in the event of a catastrophic accident involving a Bucknell student. To understand the policy, however, Abelson believes we must first understand what led up to the enactment of Act 31."
HISTORY,"According to Abelson, there were two significant precursors to Act 31. ""First was the growing national realization in the early 1980s that (1) the majority of acci dents on the road are alcohol related, and (2) that the largest responsible group is late-teen driv ers."" That realization led the fed eral government to encourage all states to raise the legal drinking age to 21. Second was the Pennsylvania host liability rule. It said that the host of a gathering at which alco hol is present is virtually com pletely responsible for the actions of guests under 21, and not at all responsible for the actions of guests over the age of 21. Abelson used an example involving two people, one the day before his 21st birthday, the other the day after his 21st birthday, drinking at Abelson's house. If they both got in their cars and killed someone, Abelson said, he would be responsible for the sub- 21-year-old, but not at all responsi ble for the over-21-year-old. ""Now this is a stupid rule,"" Abelson said, ""but it's a Pennsylvania rule, not my rule."" Additionally, Abelson said, two 1987-1988 events spurred the Pennsylvania legislature to action on Act 31. First were the Princeton 'eating club' incidents where two under-age students fell into comas after having been forced to drink alcohol by their peers. Second was the direct personal involvement of several Pennsylvania legislators and their families in cases involv ing drunk drivers."
ACT 31,"In general, Abelson believes, laws that arise as a response to problems ""tend to be less than sub-, tie."" It was this atmosphere, accord ing to Abelson, that bred Act 31. Act 31 itself, according to Abelson, very simply states ""that it is a crim inal offence for a person [or institu tion] to furnish alcohol to a minor."" The problems of interpretation begin, however, with the word 'fur nish.' The Pennsylvania legislature further defined 'furnish' as ""allow ing a minor to possess alcohol on property or premises owned or com trolled by the person [or institution] charged."" Again, however, a question of semantics arises. What does ""allowing"" mean? How far can the definition carry? To answer that question, Abelson believes we must look to the courts, which have defined 'allow' in this instance as ""to create an hospitable environ ment for the possession of alcohol."" It should therefore be the University's mission, in Abelson's mind, ""to make a reasonable effort to make certain that we have not created an hospitable environment"" for the possession of alcohol by under-age students."
IMPLEMENTATION AT,
BUCKNELL,"Act 31 became effective on May 1, 1988, and according to Dunlop, ""in the fall semester of '88 we began to realize the implica tions of that act for us."" President Gary Sojka then formed the Act 31 task force, consisting of Dunlop and Murrell, and chaired by Abel son, to, in Dunlop's words, ""decide what now was encumbent on the University"" as a result of the new law. ""Mr. Abelson agreed to rough out for us what he thought we had to do as a consequence of the court cases and the law,"" said Dunlop. After extended debate between Dunlop, Abelson, and to a lesser extent Murrell, the task force issued its first report, which was simply a refinement of Abelson's original 'roughed-out' suggestions. That report was released for public comment in December of 1988, and the deadline for com ments and suggestions was set as February 15, 1989. Dunlop conjec tures that the number of comments received was low primarily because much of the University community was unavailable during the sugges tion period. After considering the com ments that were received, the Act 31 task force issued its second and final report to the President's coun cil. According to Dunlop, ""that report contained very few changes from what [Abelson] had originally suggested."" The President's council released the policy on May 19, 1989 in a memorandum entitled ""Bucknell University Policy State ment on Alcohol."" The specific details of the policy were developed later by Dunlop and the office of student life, but he insists ""every thing flows from the work of the Act 31 task force which Mr. Abel son chaired."""
CONCLUSION,"In the final analysis, Dunlop succinctly summarizes the current situation. ""That's clearly what we're doing,"" he says, ""we are elab orately trying to cover our institu tional rear end."" Dunlop continues, ""[Abelson's] approach for doing that is to reduce risk, almost elimi nate risk if you possibly can. You'll see that our policies are designed to do that."" At the same time, Abelson makes dear that the ""feelings of anger and frustration"" students have ""must be directed to the legislature that formulated the law and not to the administration"" of the Univer sity. He compares it with the cur rent budget debate over a gas tax. If a nine cent-per-gallon tax is imposed, he says, motorists would be foolish to complain to a gas sta tion owner; they must voice their concerns to the Congress which enacted the law. On the whole, Abelson's actions seem no more than prudent steps to keep the University, again in Dunlop's words, ""out of court and out of jail. He's the expert, and I'm hard pressed to disagree with him."" page 4 The Bucknellian October 26, 1990"

Phi Kappa Psi house negotiations stall,"By Travis Elliott Staff Writer Phi Kappa Psi's Pennsylva nia Gamma House Corporation, the local alumni chapter association, and Bucknell University are final izing an agreement which would sell the Phi Psi house and its sur rounding property to the Univer sity, according to Paul Pigman, the President of Penn Gamma. Pigman said, ""There is a final agreement which we are ready to sign; We do not have any further requirements of the University nor do they have any further require ments of us."" A major obstacle to the re colonization of Phi Kappa Psi at Bucknell was overcome in August of this year when the courts dis missed a petition for the dissolu tion of the Penn Gamma House Corporation that had been negotiat ing to sell the Phi Psi house to the University. The suit was filed last year by a member of the local alumni association with the support of Phi Psi's Executive Council because they opposed the terms of the sale which were being nego tiated between Penn Gamma and members of Bucknell's administration. Pigman gave a number of justifications for the sale of the property to the University. Accord ing to Pigman, ""We [the Board of Directors of Penn Gamma] feel that the atmosphere of student attitudes and the Chapter's inability to over see the house make the sale of the house to the University the best option."" He explained that the Uni versity would be better able to oversee the Phi Psi chapter than members of the board of directors because the board members are not in close daily contact with the fraternity. Pigman noted that the Uni versity has taken a hands off atti tude in the past, but now it has decided to take an interest in gov erning student behavior. Pigman said, ""Bucknell will be able to man age the facility in a more prudent manner. It was the behavior of stu dents that caused the whole prob lem in the first place."" According to the statements of the Executive Council, the pro posal would sell the Phi Psi house and its surrounding property to the University for a fraction of its real value and did not adequately guar antee that Phi Psi members would have continued rights to live in the house. Pigman said that under the current proposal the Phi Psi broth ers will have the right to live in the house, and that right can only be revoked with the approval of the board of trustees. Thus, any changes that the faculty would like to make in the agreement must first be approved by the board of trus tees. Pigman also noted the if the University decides to sell the house in the future, it must offer it to Phi Psi first According to the Executive Council of Phi Psi, it supported the lawsuit because ""under Pennsylva nia law, a corporation charged with failing to pursue its objectives must show cause to avoid being dis solved. The Executive Council rea sons that in attempting to give the house away with no hard guarantee of future use, the House Corpora tion would relinquish its charge of holding property for the Chapter and of promoting the Chapter's best interests."" The judge in the case refused to dissolve the Penn Gamma House Corporation. According to an article in the Fall 1990 issue of The Shield of Phi Psi, the court stipulated that the sale of the house would have to be voted on and approved by the majority of Phi Psi's local alumni association. Paul Pigman responded, ""It is absolutely not the case that a for mal vote has to be taken by the members to approve the sale."" He explained that the court's decision simply required that the members be notified of the actions being taken by the House Corporation in accordance with Section 59-23 of the Pennsylvania Statutory Code. Pigman said that mail had been sent out informing members of the actions of the board of directors and calls had been made to inform members of meetings. The Executive Council noted File Photo/The Bucknellian The Phi Kappa Psi house has been closed since the Spring of 1988. The university is trying to purchase the house and the surrounding land. that students at Bucknell have expressed an interest in recoloniz ing the Penn Gamma Chapter. Chris Mitchell '92 heads a group of Bucknellians who are cur rently trying to re-establish Phi Psi on campus. According to Mitchell, an interest group has already been formed, and it should be officially recognized on campus this spring. Mitchell said, ""The National is going to try to raise enough money to restore the house so hopefully it will be nationally owned, but if not, the University will purchase it and fix it up by next fall."" According to Mitchell, the administration has been receptive to the group's wish to restart Phi Psi at Bucknell. Mitchell said, ""There have been a number of roadblocks to recolonizing Phi Psi, but the University has been the most cooperative of everyone. The administration has been very help ful and enthusiastic."" According to Phi Psi's national, the property has appre ciated from its original cost of $65,000 to nearly $1 million. It is estimated that restoring the house to a condition which would be comparable to that of University residence halls would cost $335,000, and an $18,000 mortgage is still outstanding on the property. Using the restoration figure, the trustees authorized the adminis tration in May 1988 to negotiate a purchase price for the property which would not exceed $350,000. According to estimates of Phi Kappa Psi's Executive Council, the proposed agreement would transfer the title of the house, the land, and an adjacent lot to Bucknell for only four percent of its actual replace ment value. In the article in The Shield of Phi Psi, the Phi Psi National expressed its disappointment with that offer and the House Corpora tion's proposal which would, in essence, ""give it [the property] to the University."" Pigman countered that Buck nell will agree to pay the entire expense of fixing up the house. He claimed that it would be pointless for the Corporation to bear the expense of renovating the house, only to have it poorly managed. Phi Psi Fraternity Headquar ters surveyed all Penn Gamma alumni and asked them if they sup ported the sale of the house to Bucknell. Of the nearly 25 percent of alumni who responded, 97 per cent preferred to have a Phi Psi corporation managing the Chapter house, and three percent supported the sale of the property to Bucknell. One alumnus replied, ""I am Laura Landsiedel/The Bucknellian The university estimates that it would take $335,000 to repair both the inside and outside of the Phi Kappa Psi house. very disappointed in the poor com munication from the House Corpo ration and/or that of the Penn Gamma Chapter. I am very willing to help however I may to save the house from University ownership/ control."" Phi Psi chapters have lost houses at Stanford University, Dickinson College, and Franklin and Marshall College in the past because their property transfer agreements did not contain explicit renewal options. Phi Psi National fears a similar fate at Bucknell. The Executive Council of Phi Kappa Psi said, ""Bucknell would be permitted at any time to declare that the house is no longer used as a residence hall and could thereby evict all members on four months' notice and never again make the house available to the Chapter."" The Council also noted that the pro posal does not include a guaranteed option to renew Phi Psi's right to occupy the house after the initial ten-year term. Bucknell currently owns and operates Kappa Sigma, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, and Sigma Alpha Mu as residence halls. Elias Abel- son, general counsel of the Univer sity, noted that the guarantee of occupancy does not exist with these University owned fraternity houses. Although the Executive Council admitted that these three fraternities have reported no prob lems with their agreements with Bucknell, it expressed worries that the University attitudes toward fra ternities might change in the future, citing Bucknell's new social resi dential plan as a recent change in the University's attitude toward Greek organizations. Pigman contended, ""If the University as a whole wants to get rid of the Greek System, then fos tering a fraternity is pointless. It takes a partnership between the fra ternity and the University to create a meaningful organization."" The Shield of Phi Psi article also stated, ""The Executive Council is not inherently opposed to selling the house to Bucknell; its main con cern is that the property is not trans ferred for a fraction of its value with no solid assurances of contin ued Phi Psi occupancy."" Elias Abelson, general coun sel for the University, confirmed that Bucknell is still negotiating with Phi Psi in regards to the future of the house. The administration suspended Phi Kappa Psi's charter in Spring of 1988 and then set August 31, 1990 as the first possible date for reor ganization. When the dispute between the Phi Psi National and it's local alumni association erupted, the University withdrew from negotiations and proclaimed its neutrality on the issue. In a letter to Phi Psi Head quarters, the University stated the chapter would not be allowed to reorganize until the 1991-92 aca demic year because of the dispute within the fraternity and also because of the upcoming changes and uncertainties in Bucknell's social-residential structure."

DeCerchio speaks with IFC leaders,"By Tommy Abel Staff Writer As the tensions between Uni versity Security and the student body continue to increase, Frater nity presidents and IFC Representa tives were given the opportunity to meet with the new Head of Secur ity, Vincent DeCercio. DeCercio took full advantage of his time with the Greek representatives by intro ducing himself and outlining his detailed program which targets the increasing problems between Uni versity Security and the campus community. DeCercio also fielded questions by the Representatives and commented extensively on present situations at Bucknell. DeCercio comes to the Buck nell campus from Drexel Univer sity where he held the position of head of security for three years. Before Drexel, DeCercio headed the Security Department at Bryn Mawr College for 7 years. DeCer cio quickly defined the responsibil ity that his department had to the University and to the Student body, ""to make the University, a safe place for students to pursue their academic interests."" He went on further to state that he is a strong advocate of student rights and par ticipation, and that he would adopt an ""open-door"" policy in managing the Security Department DeCercio exhibited his sincerity to the Greek body by stating that he will run a Department which emphasizes openness, communication, and understanding, characteristics which did not seem present before. DeCercio continued to develop his rapport with the Greeks by admit ting that he felt there was a break down in the System, or at least in the way it was enforced before his arrival. Mike Dominguez, president of the IFC, voiced some of his con cerns and hopes for DeCercio and his department. Dominguez stated clearly that he was not asking Security not to enforce University policy, but instead to find a more professional and more equitable method of enforcement, Domin guez's suggestions, which ranged from swift and accurate reporting of all incidents to a modified method of patrolling, were all well accepted by DeCercio. DeCercio was given the opportunity to present his plan for dealing with the recent problems between University Security and the fraternities. First, he wishes to meet with all of the concerned par ties (Greeks, Security, Student Life, Staff). From there he can move to his second step, to evaluate the information and create an ad hoc Security Advisory Committee. This committee would be made up of Greeks, student representatives. Security, Student Life, newspaper staff, and other administrators. He stressed the fact that this body would not be a figure-head type group, but instead would have the opportunity to actively contribute to Security policy. Third, the Depart ment will define the University pol icy and their interpretation of Penn sylvania law in writing. They will also list a proper security procedure and common abuses in writing. The Department will also revise and create the procedures and sanctions which are needed to address the var ious violations and abuses. All of these lists and definitions must get the approval of the Security Advi sory Committee before they are implemented. Finally, he will work with the committee to implement these procedures. Also the Security Advisory Committee will become a permanent body used both to hear complaints and as a sounding board for new ideas. DeCercio then addressed the concerns of the Greeks in atten dance. He guaranteed that there would be swift accurate reporting of all incidents and that these reports ""will not release any student names."" This would allow both the offenders and the IFC Judiciary Committee to better prepare them selves prior to meeting. DeCercio also promised to develop a clear definition of ""reasonable cause"" which would be approved by stu dent groups including the IFC. He ageed with representatives that: equal treatment of all organizations is a necessity, a committee in liai son with Security must be devel oped, and that Security needs to maintain the level of respect and trust that it receives from students. Several ""grey areas"" did come into discussion, such as the implementa tion of individual sanctions instead of group sanctions, when only a few members of an organization are in violation of University policy, ?mother ""grey areas"" that came into question were the concepts of pri vate property and probable cause. DeCercio promised that his Depart ment would quickly develop an acceptable answer to those ques tions. Finally, DeCercio assured the representatives that University Security would adhere to the mis sion statement of the University, exemplifying compassion and civil ity, and that the Security Advisory Committee would help create a sys tem of accountability for those involved in enforcing University policy. Vincent DeCercio informed the Greek representatives present that he was committed in, ""remov ing you [the Greeks] as part of the problem and making you part of the solution."" DeCercio made a strong impact on those present. His ""open- door"" policies and his participatory style of management were well received by all. DeCercio wants to be a more actively involved Direc tor of Security. ""My style is to bring students into the governance process and students have risen to the challenge very well."

Colgate,"From page 1 explained that either fraternities can go unrecognized by nationals or stay with nationals and go unrec ognized by the University. Yet, under the new residential policy, fraternity houses would be sub jected to the same stipulations as other off-campus housing units. ""If it came down to it, the fraternities would have to be recognized by the University,"" Lane concluded. The changing residential sys tems indicate that national fraterni ties and sororities need revisions of their own. Commerford suggested that there be ""a different kind of membership development in nationals... the practices they've always had are not consistent with where we are in 1990."" Bucknell's student leaders agreed that the creation of TIP as well as Colgate's similar model, will improve students' image of the University. Dave Skena '92, presi dent of Bucknell Student Govern ment, said ""students will realize that the problem of social/ residential changes is not specific to Bucknell."" Skena said, ""the trus tees have let TIP pound out the details...I hope for Colgate's sake they let the directives be carried out by students."" Mike Dominguez '91, IFC President, viewed TIP as ""a broad cross-section of the Univer sity in deciding how recommenda tions are going to be implemented."" Yet, according to Dominguez, ""Colgate might have taken a wiser step into implementation period. Bucknell is allowing one year which doesn't leave much time for planning."" Charlotte Jacobsen-Weddle, Associate VP for Student Life, believed that the similarities between Colgate and Bucknell ""can't be accidental"" because Col gate's Dean of Students was directly informed of the changes at Bucknell, Weddle explained ""Col gate looked at what we had dome and what Dickinson had done...we're moving in parallel, but clearly different directions."" Wed dle believes the changes ""clearly suggest that the president's and the trustees' vision is one that Colgate has found a positive or convincing model."""

Greek philanthropy contributes,
to off campus community,C o u rtesy o f P ublic R elations Habitat for Humanity founder and President Millard Fuller will speak at the 10:30 a.m. Rooke Chapel service this Sunday.
Battle ensues over,
incinerator plans,"By Tara Gilligan Staff Writer Fraternities and sororities hold an important position, not only on campus, but within the Lewis burg community. Most Greek organizations form philanthropy committees to decide which service projects the group will donate money to. These philanthropies range from donating food and clothing to sponsoring a room at the Ronald McDonald House. Fraternities often become involved in at least one philan thropic project. Chi Phi visits the United Methodist Church once a year for a round of bingo. Around St. Patrick's Day, fraternity broth ers sell green carnations in the Lan- gone Center: proceeds go to benefit Muscular Distrophy. Hosting the Special Olympics is Chi Phi's most time-consuming task. The house has hosted the games since 1984. ""This year, the brothers of Chi Phi look forward to our first nationally sanctioned games, which means that our best athletes are able to compete in national competitions,"" said Wade Bendele. In preparation of the games, Chi Phi fraternity brothers go to weekly practice sessions for the athletes, attend meetings of Central Susquehanna Valley Special Olym pics Committee (CSSO), and assist in other CSSO functions. The fra ternity raises $5000 for the games each year by soliciting local businesses. Also working with area chil dren, Sigma Chi participates in the Big Brothers/Big Sisters program. Ten fraternity members spend four to five hours a week with little By Natalie Dunlap Staff Writer Boris Notkin, leading Soviet television anchorman and com mentator, entertained members of the Bucknell community in Rooke Chapel on Monday, October 8 as part of his five week lecture tour of the United States. His lecture about the culture and people of the Soviet Union was followed by an open question and answer session and was sponsored by the Bucknell Student Lectureship Committee. Notkin is watched by over 40 million Soviet citizens as anchorman and commentator for the Soviet television program ""Good Evening, Moscow"" which is best described as a cross between ""Good Morning, Amer ica"" and ""60 Minutes."" He is a Pro fessor of Rhetoric at the University of Moscow and holds a doctorate in Soviet social history. In addi tion, he has published three books and over 50 articles on political rhetoric and political psychology and has served as an interpreter for several U.S. presidents during their visits to the Soviet Union. Sitting informally at the front of the chapel, he conducted his lec ture just as he does his television program. Through his discussion he attempted to answer the most frequently asked questions about the Soviet Union and its people illustrating many of his points with a joke. Following his lecture, he welcomed questions from the audi ence establishing the motto, ""You ask me all the questions you like, and I answer all the questions I like."" One of Notkin's first focuses was to explain who in the Soviet Union is against change, or who constitutes the anti-perestroika forces. He described die system that Stalin created as being ""extremely easy to run"" as com pared to the delicate U.S. system. For 80 years, however, people fol lowing this system have opposed democratic changes. Notkin used a popular joke to illustrate the types of leaders that the Soviet Union has had and why change has been such a struggle: ""Stalin proved that one can be in power as long as one lives. Khrushchev proved that any body could be in power, and Brezhnev proved that nobody could be in power."" brothers. The whole fraternity has helped with the Big Brothers pro gram by hosting a barbecue after one football game, by planning Halloween and Valentine's Day parties, and by painting and remod eling the Big Brothers/Big Sisters office. Sigma Chi also helps Santa's Snippers, who support Susque hanna's Women in Transitions. The fraternity helps a needy family from Lewisburg. Money for Sigma Chi service projects comes from the Sig Derby. For its services Sigma Chi received an award for philanthropic excellence from the Interfraternity Council. The funds for Lambda Chi's service projects come from an annual Lambda Chi Alpha Road- race, held this year Oct. 13. Money raised goes to the Food Pantry, run through the First Baptist Church in Lewisburg. ""The Food Pantry serves over 200 local needy families. Last year the $1500 was used to buy turkey dinners for people served by the Food Pantry,"" said Timothy Amman, race organizer. Last year Lambda Chi raised $1500 from its race. This year, the fraternity will be able to donate $2000 to the Food Pantry. The 82 brothers of Lambda Chi spent a total of 500 hours on the project. Sigma Alpha Epsilon (SAE) collects food for local churches, visits an elderly persons home, and tutors high school students. SAE claims to be the first fraternity to begin a recycling program on campus. SAE's philanthropic concerns are campus-wide. To increase alco- He described three separate groups that used to exist in the Soviet Union as those at the top, the semiconductors, and those at the bottom. Those at the top gave the orders and those at the bottom had no impact on the decision mak ing. Those in the middle level were called semiconductors because they allowed the commands to go from the top to the bottom but never in reverse. Although these particular groups do not exist as such in the Soviet Union today, Notkin still believes, ""We have to completely restructure the whole government structure of the Soviet Union... of the republics... the subordination."" Another major point of inter est on which Notkin concentrated was the enormous amount of short ages in the Soviet Union. He described the Soviet Union's eco nomic situation as ""the worst aspect of our restructuring through perestroika"". The ultimate task is to go from what has been called a planned economy to a market econ omy. In the past, all economic aspects had been planned by the State Planning Committee. Here, again, Notkin used a joke to dem onstrate the effects of this planned form of economy: ""What will hap pen if the State Planning Commit tee is moved to a desert? The answer: At first nothing will hap pen. Then there will be shortage of sand."" Notkin noted that shortages have never been as severe as recently in the Soviet Union. In January, there was no soap and detergents. This caused the miners to go on strike because they could not wash after their shifts. Next came the sugar crisis because the whole country was engaged in moonshining. At the onset of peres troika, the Soviet government began a severe anti-alcohol policy, very similar to the America's Pro hibition. As Notkin revealed, ""We repeated all your blunders in Prohi bition--all, and had absolutely the same results."" These results being a rise in crime rate and moonshining. Tobacco and bread shortages fol lowed these. Notkin has his. own belief about the sources of these short ages, ""In my opinion, it is a combi nation of the old planned economy plus inefficiencies of the new sys tem."" According to a public opin ion poll, many people in the Soviet hoi awareness and faculty interac tion programming, the fraternity initiates open forums on pertinent topics. The philanthropy office of SAE has raised thousands of dollars for local and national charities. The money, last year, came from a soft- ball marathon, which SAE co sponsored. SAE, too, has been recog nized for its achievements. Last year, the fraternity received its eighth consecutive Chapter Achievement Award. Two years ago SAE won the Mosely Award for Zeal, given to the best chapter nationally. The achievement Phi Gamma Delta seems most proud of is the collective 3.1 grade point average of the brothers. Still, brothers com mit 2000 hours each year to com munity service. From money raised at the fra ternity's three on three hoops tour nament and Luigi Fiji, Phi Gamma Delta contributed over $200 to the Lewisburg food and clothing drive and to the Lewisburg little league defending champions. Sororities, too, engage in philanthropic projects. Beta Gamma, which is Bucknell's only local sorority, received the Panhel- lenic Award for Philanthropic Excellence last year. The sorority raises money for the Ronald McDo nald House in Danville. Beta Gamma raises approximately $3000 each year towards the program; the consistency of such funds has allowed the sorority to agree to donate $15,000 over the next five years for room sponsorship at the Ronald McDonald House. A fruit and support basket sale during Fall and Spring finals' Union have their own views about the cause of these shortages: 12% blamed Gorbachev's perestroika, 18% blamed the planned economy, 33% thought the shortages occurred as sabotage of the conservatives, and 36% blamed the ""shadow econ omy"", or black market, which con stitutes one-quarter of the economy in the Soviet Union. Notkin admitted, ""I don't know still what is the reason of these shortages or this wide spread corruption, but I'm absolutely sure that with any luck these facto ries...become private, we shall not have this wide-scaled steal ing...because nobody has yet learned how to steal from oneself."" He further explained, ""In all my shows, I advocate and champion the transition to real free market econ omy as soon as possible and to pri vate property as soon as possible."" It is the conservatives who do not want this transition. To them, mar ket economy is ""a kiss of death"". He has realized that the Soviet Union ""should not try to be unlike everybody else."" Notkin pointed out that the leading countries in the world have many differences, but they also have many things in com mon like democracy, freedom of speech, private property, and free dom of religion. He described these common aspects as ""universal for the prosperity of the nation."" He believes that market economy is also essential, ""Without market economy, you are bound to rot. You are bound to stagnate. But if you have it, it does not guarantee that you will prosper."" A transition to weeks, an annual round-robin rac- quetball tournament, and two candy sales produce the $3000 needed each year to maintain the sorority's level of contribution to its philanthropy. The seven other sororities are chapters of national organizations, which often have their own philan thropies. ""Our national philan thropy is Tri Delta Children's Can cer Charity. Each chapter decides the specific cancer they want to work with; our chapter supports the Geisinger Children's Hospital in Danville,"" said Kim Higgins, presi dent of Delta Delta Delta. For this project, the sorority raises funds by selling mums for Parent's Weekend and candy apples at Homecoming. In addition, Tri Delta sisters ""provide assistance for an elderly, invalid Tri Delta Alumna that lives in Lewisburg,"" said Higgins. And the sorority raised $50 to buy an acre of South American Rain For est The acre has become part of the Rain Forest Preserve. Kappa Kappa Gamma's list of philanthropic projects over the past year includes making ""weekly visits to the Lutheran Village to serve meals and talk,"" tutoring stu dents at Milton Jr. High School, and co-sponsoring with Sigma Pi Epsi lon a Halloween party for children of the community, according to Becky Bunting, philanthropy chair. Reaching beyond the Lewis burg area, the sorority ""held a raffle to raise money to sponsor a child in Mexico,"" said Bunting. The sisters of Kappa Kappa Gamma also plan to participate in the upcoming dance marathon, sponsored by Students Against Muscular Distrophy."
changes,"democracy and market economy will not just happen by itself; the people must work to make it grow and to ensure its prosperity. His lecture ended with an explanation of a common miscon ception about why Soviets do not smile. Actually, as Notkin explained, it is not that Soviets do not smile, but rather that there are only two cases when Soviets do smile. One is when they are very happy to see a certain loved one, and so they smile with joy. The second is when something is extremely funny. It is just a matter of culture. In America, a smile means politeness, and one that does not smile is ""hostile"" or ""mali cious."" Soviets should not be pre judged as hostile or malicious, because in accordance with their culture, they do not smile at strangers. Notkin does see good things happening in the Soviet Union. Gorbachev has recently been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. There are many more religious freedoms, and of course, there is glasnost and freedom of the press. Notkin is pleased that the Soviet Union is not feared in the world as it once was. He expressed a posi tive Soviet attitude toward Ameri cans and explained one of the ways his country benefits from the U.S., ""Americans are liked in the Soviet Union. We tend to overlook your problems ... your disadvantages, and try to learn from your advan tages and your merits in order to make life better in the Soviet Union."" By Bob Ritter Staff Writer Nearly three months after rumors of a proposed hazardous waste incinerator in Union County began circulating, the two sides in the intensifying battle met face-to- face for the first time in USPCI's first informational meeting on the proposed $100 million project on October 18. Nearly 1,000 people jammed the auditorium at the Warrior Run Middle School to hear officials of USPCI and its parent company, Union Pacific Corp., explain details of the facility, planned for 700 acres of land in Gregg Town ship, north of Allenwood, and allay public concerns about the incinera tor's safety. The crowd, which was decidedly opposed to the plan, sat somewhat patiently through a slide presentation, but ten succeeded in shouting down Union Pacific Chairman Drew Lewis, when he began to speak. Lewis was forced to abandon his prepared remarks and proceed directly to a question and answer session when residents began to take to the microphones set up for that purpose. Lewis was repeatedly ques tioned on the assurances of safety are residents have in the plan, and on the sincerity of USPCI's inter est in public input on the plan. During the September 21 press conference to announce the pro ject, Lewis said USPCI would not ""try to jam things down [the] throats"" of area residents, a posi tion he reiterated during the meet ing, saying ""we're here to give you the information to make a decision with."" He explained that the infor mational meeting was the begin ning of a two-year process of pub lic hearings mandated by the Pennsylvania Department of Envi ronmental Resources, in which the company hopes to show residents the incinerator ""will be construc tive, and will provide approxi mately 1,000 jobs for the commu nity. [We want you] to realize it will be a constructive part of the community."" However, when asked directly whether the com pany would abandon the plan in two years if the public response was still negative, Lewis responded directly, saying ""The answer is no."" Lewis' response caused nearly one third of the audi ence to walk out of the auditorium in protest. When asked what assurances of the incinerator's safety the pub lic would have, Lewis explained that, under law. Union Pacific's $12.5 billion balance sheet is on the line for any damages caused by the facility, and he dismissed sugges tions that the company post a bond or place money in an escrow for Gregg Township as further insu rance against environmental dam age or health problems in the area. Lewis also said that ""we cannot remove ourselves from liability for the site,"" even is Union Pacific were to sell either the facility or USPCI. When asked how individ ual citizens would be able to bring claims against USPCI if they feel their health is damaged by the incinerator, Lewis said only that Union Pacific ""is a responsible cor poration with responsible management."" When asked why Union County was chosen for the inciner ator when most of Pennsylvania's hazardous waste is generated in the southern half of the state, Lewis explained that the site was chosen because ""it meets the geological criteria, and because of the poten tial for economic development"" in the Susquehanna Industrial Park, of which USPCI will be the owner and anchor tenant. The hostility evident at the meeting has been building since early September, when the Organi zation United for Ecology (OUE) began organizing local support against the proposed incinerator, which would bum 70,000 tons of organic hazardous waste per year and feature on-site burial of the ash in an above-ground ""monofill,"" preventing any contact with groundwater supplies. Since the plans were first rumored the Union County Commissioners and nearly every municipality in the county have gone on record against the plan, along with Union County State Rep. Russ Fairchild and Union County Economic Develop ment Director Bob Garrett. In addi tion, the Allenwood Fire Company has said it would not guarantee fire protection to the facility, which is within its coverage area."

Quakers find unity in,
silence and diversity,"By Rob Schroeder Imagine a typical Christian church service. The preacher preaches in a loud tone, instructing the congregation, representing the word of God. Passages are spoken from the scriptures. Music can be heard. The congregation's collective voice recites prayers and sings songs. The church is alive with sounds and the spoken word. Silence--except for the few moments of sub dued prayer--is practically shunned. Now imagine, if you can, a service with no voices, no music, no preaching and no sound. The members of this con gregation simply sit in silence. Before their formal meeting its members do as any other might do: chat noisily amongst themselves about their daily lives, greet friends not seen since last week, laugh and talk them selves into a closely-knit community. But during the meeting, the members of this particular Society dis tinguish themselves from any other denomination, by sitting in complete and total silence. I recently sat in on one of these meetings of the Religious Society of Friends, a denomination more commonly known as the Quaker sect ""Silence,"" said former Buck- nell religion Professor Gerald Cooke, a member of the Society's Lewisburg meeting, ""is for each person to seek the divine in him self."" Professor Cooke and Eliza beth Marsh, (mother of Ben Marsh, professor of geography) spoke can didly with me before the meeting about the Quaker faith in general, and about its similarities with other religions. Mrs. Marsh stressed the contemplative aspect of the faith, equating the practice of silence with Buddhist meditation. ""Silence itself is a kind of very simple ritual; it gets everyday preoccupations out of the way,"" Professor Cooke explained. He went on to tell me that the notion of individual divin ity had Biblical roots, that God breathed life into all creatures He made. ""Divinity,"" Mrs. Marsh went on to urge, ""is in every The hum of the air conditioner and the ticking of the clock on the min ute every minute were the only sounds in the library. People sat normally in their chairs or in a quasi-meditative position, with their backs straight. All their faces were introspective and thoughtful. person."" During the hour-long meet ing (service), I felt certain that each of the nine members present was trying to seek the divinity they believed in. Though not a Quaker, and not even religious, I experi enced a relaxation, a feeling of community in that silence. The meeting was held in the English department library in Vaughan Lit erature Building, a soothing setting perfect for the meeting. We sat in a horseshoe-shaped arrangement, on plain chairs. Some members' eyes were open, some were half-closed."

Things you can do without: Materkd possessions. Person (dead or alive) you'd most like to have dinner with: Margaret Thatcher. Movie you could see anytime: Any Ingmar Bergman film. Three things that can always be found in your refrigerator: Carrots, water, tunafish. Bucknell's best-kept secret: The depth of academic qualifica tions among the faculty. I don't think the students appre ciate the high quality of staff and personal attention in the small classes until they leave Bucknell. Pet peeve about Bucknell: Climbing that hill! Also, its physical locale is too far removed from everywhere. People may be surprised to know: In my private time I like to do outdoor activities such as photographing animals, visiting an animal sanctuary... Being outdoors keeps me sane and keeps my energy level high. Having attended Catholic services earlier in my life, I got the sense that the Quaker's faith is not easily adopted by those acquainted with the kind of service imagined ear lier. For those used to sermons and instruction, a silent Quaker meeting might be uncomfortable. Another tenet of the faith is the absence of creed. To be a Quaker is to search individually for spiritual meaning, without organized guidance. Yet at the meeting I attended, all of the nine members had come to the faith from different denominations. One had been Jewish. One member was even a former United Methodist minister. The Society has drawn its Friends since the 17th century. The faith originated in England, and has, since its founding, spread all over the United States, with its largest following in the Mid-west. The Society's heritage, though, is strongest in the East. Pennsylvania, in fact, was founded by a Quaker, and still claims a sizable group of Friends from among its residents. There has been a meeting at Buck nell since 1953, Mrs. Marsh said. While silence is the norm at a Quaker meeting, expression is encouraged. I was surprised to hear the first, which came from Eliza beth Marsh. She spoke without inhibition about an ""awesome"" meeting of Friends in Philadelphia she had recently attended. Through out her monologue she thoughtfully talked about the Quakers' associa tion with peace movements, disar mament, and their general opposi tion to war. As a group and as individuals, she said, there is much to be done. Addressing the situation in Iraq, Mrs. Marsh claimed that the ""burden rests on any one of us, any one of us could be the next one"" to be called to fight. But she then went on to talk about a voice, ""the voice of rea son, wisdom, the Divine voice"" that Quakers seek to discover in themselves as they sit and contemplate. This voice of God that Quakers believe to be within them is what makes up their opposition to war, and concerns them with humanitarian struggles. I was told of the Society's involvement with foster child programs, their oppo sition to capital punish ment, and the extensive amount of other commu nity services and volunteer work that is done. Locally, Friends work with Susque hanna Valley Women in Transition, and hold meet ings and study sessions at a nearby prison. Quakers are ""not unaware of what other people's plights are,"" said one woman. ""The time we spend in meeting, with ourselves,"" claimed another member, ""helps us realize what's important and helps us respond when there are callings."" During and after the meeting the subject of what a Quaker is and does was brought up frequently. By the end of my stay with these unique people I found it indeed ""hard to put [my] finger on what a Quaker is,"" as member Juanita Bishop said it would be. Yet even though opinions differed and debate actually occurred after the meeting, there was definitely the ""unity in diversity"" that Mrs. Bishop spoke of. Clearly the unity was created by the collective humanitarian concern, and the belief that ""there is that of God in every person,"" and that ""every per son has that core goodness inside of them."" Silence, the main tool of the Quaker, is for finding just that Note: Though there happened to be no Bucknell students at the meeting I attended, Mrs. Marsh informed me that Bucknellians do come from time to time, and are always welcome. The meetings are held Sunday mornings from 10:30 to 11:30 am in the Department of English library, in Vaughan Litera ture Building."
Dear Wanda,"Dear Wanda, Someone on my hall is constantly coming into my room and asking to borrow things (food, clothes, tapes, etc.).

Explain that: -you had dozed through class and you didn't take notes -your handwriting is illeg ible and show a sample -you're going to Spain next semester and you take all your notes in Spanish -it's against your religion to share your intellectual ideas -you feel that it's unfair to miss class so much while you go every day 2. The Excuse. You slept through your eight o'clock and attendence was mandatory. Here arc some original excuses: -your roomate eloped to Peru, taking all of your clean underwear -the Caf ran out of Captain Crunch and you were forced to wait until a new shipment arrived -you had to stay in your room to hear the New Kids on the Block Hour on the radio -someone had Crazy Glued your door shut -you felt you needed more time to fully reflect on the assignment For your specific classes: Archaeology 100 - you found a dust bunny under you bed that appeared to date back to the 1800's, it had to be studied and catalogued Psychology 100 - your Id had taken control of your mind and you could not fight your urge to return to bed Philosophy 100 - as you were leaving for class you had a flash of insight into the true meaning of life and you had to write it down (then the paper spontaneously combusted) Spanish 100 - you needed to fly to Spain and get in some practice before class Biology 100 - the month- old leftover ravioli that was in the comer of your room mutated into a carnivorous life form, you needed to study it under a microscope Send your problems to: Dear Wanda do The Bucknellian Box C-30S9"

Bison,"By Marc Haimes Staff Writer Well, it's 12:00 and I think I would like to spend the next 20 minutes getting hit on the head and shoved into walls by my fel low laid-back Bucknellians. Time to check mail! So I clutch my 462 page version of The Odyssey, which my English Pro fessor has told the class to study while noting use of alliteration, (there's something about English professors that really scares me) and use it machete-style to chop a path through the polite people who have determined that a packed mail room is an ideal place to peruse postcards or engage in leisurely conversation. I haven't had this much fun since the time I got wedged in- between the Ritz Bits and the Very-Fine Fruit Juice while waiting on line at our spacious new 'Temporary"" Bison. When I reach the correct alcove, I kick aside the piles of What's Hap pening? tossed on the floor and crouch down to peer inquisi tively inside my box. What's this?...some kind of red card... Oh my God...It's telling me I've got a PACKAGE!! YEAHHHH! I snatch the precious pink parcel- purveying particle and enthusias tically squeeze through the swarm of students in an attempt to reach the front desk and claim my prize! After I replace the stupid slip which turned out to be for my box-mate, I head into the Bookstore to cheer myself up by doing some discount shopping. Wow, look at this! Cotton boxer *shorts...normally sold at K-Mart for 97 cents but you can get them here at the B.U. Book store, with little miniature Bison printed on them, for the bargain price of just $27. Or, if you're not into having large brown mammals plastered proximate to your privates, you can invest in 'this attractive orange and blue B.U. Golf Umbrella yours for just...(ha ha) don't even worry about it! Charge it now, and fret later! Just remember to pay your bills on time, or else they will send Bucky to your room with his. special orange and blue B.U. brass knuckles.... So I wander amidst the orange and blue (of course) B.U. lingerie until finally I break down! I find myself heading toward the back of the establish ment....! am approaching the spot which contains the ever-so- tempting yellow and black... CLIFF NOTES of the classics. And how about this...ONE 43 page version of The Odyssey just crying out for some eager young student to take him away from the terrible store and give him a home. This wonderful learning-"
Tales,"aid could acquaint me with all nuances of the distinguished and enlightening epic...in less than twenty minutes. Now I can watch ""Santa Barbara"" later today. But hold on for one sec ond! My English Professor encouraged the class to be free thinkers...which basically means (according to the content of his lectures) that we should relate everything in the story to sex. I don't need any help to do that. Although, I guess I was kind of disillusioned on the first day of class when he strolled into the room and began asserting the REAL meaning of the thorn in Sleeping Beauty. Next, we dis cussed Cinderella's eagerness to loose her ""Glass Slipper."" Our professor ended the lecture by proclaiming, ""I'm not saying that Snow White was a tramp, but every morning she woke up feel ing Dopey!"" Throughout this semester, I have learned that there is an entire universe of phallic sym bols... besides the one in front of Vedder Hall. Swords, daggers, feathers, grass, aerosol contain ers, and fireflies can all be seen in a different light. I now no longer give my papers bland High Schoolesque titles like ""Twain's Use of Colors"" or ""The River as a Road."" My first A in the class was awarded to me when I wrote an essay entitled ""Huck's Brief Flirtation with Nymphomania, and Jim's use of the Sexual Trinity to put Huck back on the 'Blue' (calmer) Path of the River."" I guess I do wonder, though, why every single lecture in class seems geared towards our dangling modifiers. Does the professor enjoy seeing the entire class shift uncomfortably, as the men casually lift their books onto their laps? Well... proba bly, but I'm just disappointed that no one ever pointed out to me sooner that reading anything besides those digest-sized maga zines on the top shelf of the mag azine store (the ones with inter esting and thought-provoking stories like, Rub a Dub Dub, 17 People, 8 Parakeets, 3 Rolls of Plastic Wrap, and a Can of Tuna Fish in a Gatorade filled Hot Tub,) could be so educational! I guess I never realized how many great authors there are besides Nameandaddress Withheld. You know, now that I think about it, I kind of like my English class... and my professor! I continue to contemplate the countless joys of the classics as I carry my purchase to the counter...a bag of M&M's to munch as I read my 462 pages.

"Chairman of the Board of Trustees talks about the Greek system,",
"social alternatives, admission drops and more...","By Sue Basalla Staff Writer Current chairman of the Board of Trustees, Lee Idleman, sits back comfortably in his chair while speaking articulately and confidently of the ""simpler"" days he spent at Bucknell in the 1950's. Graduating in 1954 with a B.S. in commerce and finance and a minor in history, Idleman remembers the less complicated times when, as assistant to the athletic director, he could easily call up the head of sports at Temple and work out a mutually convenient time for a home football game. Idleman also reflects upon the years he spent in KDP fraternity, living downtown at 120 6th Street doing ""his share of underage drinking."" As I question Idleman about the state of Bucknell today, his aspect changes and a look of concern shadows his face. Immediately putting all nostalgia aside, Idleman concentrates on explaining his role in creating uni versity policies that will be accepta ble both to students who protest infringment on their rights and to society which demands greater conservatism. What was the situation with alcohol and the Greek system in the 50's? ""About 2/3 of campus were Greek...In the best of my memory, life was simpler to the extent that there was an unwritten rule that the campus was private property., thus there was no pressure on the admin istration to end drinking per se except as it interrupted activities or as people got out of control...I think to some extent there was less drink ing because it wasn't quite so dar ing or exciting to do it...Today it seems to be almost a dare situa tion..in loco parentis applied at that point....In the 60's and 70's those rules disappeared and every one was free to do what they wanted and the school had no authority or obligation so the pen dulum swung very far in that direc tion. Now it's come back, and we're expected to exercise a degree of control; we're required by fed eral and state law and we find our selves in the unfortunate position of having to administer very unpopu lar laws."" What did the fraternity mean to you while you were here and how did it change after wards? What would you say to the students witholding Senior Gift Drive donations in protest of Greek system changes? ""As the chairman of the board, of course, I'm interested in collecting whatever we can...but I have to be realistic about it to real ize and to recognize my own feel ings and attitudes as you asked in your question. I was glad to get out of here. Four years of study seemed endless, there was always an assignment hanging over your head, Lewisburg seemed small and confining and, as you say, to the extent that your loyalties at that point really hadn't been formed or shaped very well and I think it takes later years to come to the realization of what you have gained from it and what it did mean to you. My family moved around a great deal when I was young and I skipped a grade, so I came to Buck nell as a fairly young 17 year-old. For me, the fraternity was a home away from home in the sense of establishing some roots with a group of people who were ready made built-in friends. I don't feel that I was excluding other people; I have several close friends who were not Greeks, one was my freshman roommate and we're still very close....there is no question that that is a group I can identify with, but I feel that Bucknell comes first and the fraternity comes second in terms of your loy- alites and your committment."" On social alternatives: ""I happened to have a chance to catch the tail-end of the concert [Little Feat] last night and I was very pleased to see an awful lot of kids seeming to have a very good time in a non-alcohol environment. Maybe we should be doing that three nights a week in order to give them an outlet and have some kind of constructive activities without always seeming to come to the lowest common denominator of 18 year-olds drinking more than they should."" On admissions drops: ""We're a little concerned about admissions drops in the past couple years which may be related to concerns about social activites as well as demographics and prices. I think students need to be aware that this same problem is occuring at lots of other schools, both in and out of Pennsylvania. They're not alone in being perse cuted at the moment Society in general has decided that they don't want teenage drinkers at this point This may change; we went through an era when no one was allowed to drink, the Prohibiton Era... They've changed the voting age, the drinking age, the driving age, but unfortunately, or whatever you want to call it, the students here today are in this time warp and unfortunately society today does not want teenage drinking and we are expected to enforce those rules. It's awkward and unpleasant and difficult, but there doesn't seem to be much choice about it."" Moving away from the Greek issue, I understand that there is a new landscaping plan being developed. ""We have retained a firm to do a master plan of the cam- pus...The campus used to face the downtown area., now it faces more toward Route 15. It's changed the sightlines, some of the older trees are dying--a variety of things need to be addressed to improve the visiblity of the campus."" Why is an attractive cam pus important and how can you justify spending funds to make an already beautiful campus more beautiful when there are so many concerns about not enough financial aid, not enough diver sity and about retaining faculty? ""The plan may involve a commitment of major funds over a number of years, but whatever we do it must fit within the operating budget, be practical and make sense. We spend a substantial amount of money every year on maintenance--we try to renovate one of the dorms every year...I think you're aware of the stadium renovations. That was over a mil lion dollars but I think most people would agree that was a well-spent sum in view of the attractiveness which that former eye-sore gives us in one of the main entrance areas of our campus. We weigh all these decisions. Financial aid is certainly important...As we have increased tuition we have increased financial aid even more."" If you could change one thing overnight, what would you do? ""I would like to see that today's students can study and learn and play hard and enjoy them selves without having alcohol as a part of it. It may be Utopian; it's what society is asking at the moment and requiring of us. I guess that the sooner the students get that message and move to try and make the best of it, the happier they'll be and can get on with a more positive outcome. It's very painful, I enjoyed my years here when there was less pressure on these issues and I did my share of underage drinking but that does not excuse the issue or tell you where we are today. As a result, we have no choice but to recognize that this is the law of the land and hope that we can defuse the adversarial rela tionships which don't serve anyone very well...We're looking to the students to help design a fabric of social life on this campus, more special interest groups, more unique and different housing arrangements, more activi ties... whatever will serve to create a more positive Bucknell experi ence for our students."" Courtesy Public Relations Lee Idleman '54 believes that life on the campus in the '50's was ""simpler"" than it is today."

"Wine, Dine and",
well...never mind,With Julie Bachman and Steve Hoerter Staff Writers
Shannon's,
Sunbury,
988-1907,"As Julie and Steve wound their way down a woodsy gravel road toward Shannon's Restaurant, the mood was quite anticipatory. The premises of the final destination were rather quaint and invit ing...for a moment they might have been in the Great North Woods of Wisconsin. But, upon entering, things went frighteningly awry. Their first clue should have been the simulated hardwood carpeting on the floor. The second clue should have been the way the menu was organized...categorically by price. Instead of listing entrees under ""chicken,"" ""seafood,"" or ""beef"" categories, surf & turf would be listed under the $18.95 column. WHAT A CLASSY JOINT. You have probably gathered by now that the ambiance of this place is rather dismal and tacky. The tables are arranged like a mess hall on an Army base and the floor is in fact covered with the worst carpeting you could find. In all fairness, it should be noted for the record that even though Julie and Steve are elitists, they did enter this restaurant with a positive, tolerant and receptive attitude. Julie chose to dine on the ever-popular Chicken Peaches & Cream. (The $7.95 version...yes, there were two versions.) Accompa nying this mysterious dish was a salad, served ""family style,"" in a bowl large enough for a sumo wrestler to bathe in. The entree also came with choice of vegetable and potato. In retrospect, Julie commented that her meal was ""interesting and different...but not something to be recommended to the more dis cerning dining patron."" The salad was hearty...but the thousand island dressing lacked any special quality. Steve, too, could not resist the intriguing and enigmatic sound of Chicken Peaches and Cream."" His response was quite similar to Julie's, yet Steve decided to take it one step further by issuing a word or two of warning to perspective diners: ""Do not eat the chicken and peaches at the same time. It confuses the palate."" Julie and Steve thought they might have stumbled on to the perfect alternative dining experience for fellow Bucknellians. Unfor- tuneatly, the only good thing that can be said about Shannon's is that they serve a good Genny Light and do not seem to care about your age. Julie and Steve do not recommend Shannon's and assign a mea ger, yet charitable, two Bison to the establishment."

The Campus Theater: A,
shared piece of history,"By Donna Walsh Many Bucknellians routinely take advantage of the ready-made study break found in the form of the Campus Theater. While at the theater, students can forget their worries and cares, abandon their books for a few hours, and dream about Julia Roberts or Patrick Swayze. Lewisburg townspeople, as well, frequent the old-fashioned movie-house. Since its establish ment in Lewisburg, though, the Campus Theater has been much more than a source of entertain ment. The theater has had an inter esting history within the commu nity, and its proprietors have come to occupy a significant role both on campus and in town. Yet, this sense of history can hardly be experi enced during a two-hour movie! The Campus Theater was originally owned as part of a nine theater chain located throughout Pennsylvania. The owners were four immigrant brothers living in the Philadelphia area who had found themselves, by some strange fluke, in the film industry. Mr. Har old Steifel, a son of one of the orig inal owners, eventually took over the theater in Lewisburg, and ran it in addition to a second theater, also located on Market Street After closing the second movie-house, Mr. Steifel concentrated his efforts on the Campus Theater, which still remains in the Steifel family. Today, Mr. Steifel's widow, Jackie, operates the Campus Theater from the very same desk that has been used since the theater was built. As proprietor of the local movie-house, Mr. Steifel became a well-known figure in the commu nity. Patrons remember him best as standing in front of the theater, next to the parking meter, and saying ""hello"" to movie-goers as they bought their tickets. After his death in 1988, patrons donated a bronze star, reading ""Harold Steifel Stood Here"". They placed it in the pave ment in front of the theater, next to the parking meter, in remembrance of Mr. Steifel's habit of greeting his customers. The Steifels were well- known in the Bucknell community as well. Mr. Steifel, who was a Bucknell graduate and Sigma Alpha Mu brother, served as advisor to Sigma Alpha Mu for 35 years. Mrs. Steifel characterizes this relationship as an active one, recalling that her husband attended each of the fraternity's meetings and that they both acted as chape rones for Sammy's parties in years past The Campus Theater has also demonstrated its dedication to local charities and needy causes. For the past three years, the Theater has been hosting an annual charity show in Mr. Steifel's name. Mr. Steifel had always expressed an interest in the community, and was dedicated to making improvements where he could, so the charity shows were designed as a tribute to him. Past shows have benefiued the public library and the Evangelical hospice. The third annual charity show was held this past week, and the proceeds will benefit the Sus quehanna Valley Women in Transi tion. Volunteers from the Bucknell community and from Lewisburg cooperate to make the annual bene fits a success. Regarding this con tinued service to the community in her husband's name, Mrs. Steifel said, ""He would well approve of that."" With the annual charity show just over, the Theater will soon be in preparation for the next big event --  the 50 year anniversary of the Campus Theater in Lewisburg. It is actually quite remarkable that such a theater has survived the trend toward malls and large movie com plexes. Despite changing trends in the industry, however, the Campus Theater has remained virtually the same in many ways during the past"
M,
y i,"Ashley Chertkof/The Bucknellian The 50-year old marquee of the Campus Theater is the original one which was installed when the theater was built. 50 years. The facade bears the orig inal orange and blue colors in honor of the university, and the foyer is still decorated with bison and athletic figures. The marquee is the original one erected 50 years ago. Much of the interior also remains unaltered, and the conces sion stand has even resisted change in that it was never redesigned to incorporate an ice machine! Despite the aforementioned similarities, the Campus Theater has witnessed some changes over the years. The second floor, which is no longer accessible, was once a U.S.O. during World War II. The young Army and Navy men who were in training programs at the university, as well as the women studying there, used to come to socialize on the second floor of the theater. More recently, a Bucknell Management 101 Company made some improvements to the inside of the theater as part of its service pro ject last year. Mrs. Steifel noted that the theater was just equipped with a ""wrap-around, stereophonic"" sound system, which would enhance the sense of realism in the picture. She is also planning to repair the seats and do some paint ing in the theater before the anni versary celebration in January. Although there are very few of the large, old-fashioned theaters still in existence, it seems as if the Campus Theater will face contin ued success in Lewisburg. Mrs. Steifel said that people seem to ""enjoy the ambiance of the whole place."" Moreover, there is a shared sense of history between the thea ter, community, and university. So if you're in search of a mode of procrastination, take a walk to the Campus Theater and take a step backward in time to look at a part of the history of Bucknell and Lewisburg. r"

Actors succeed; Ibsen falls short,"By Michael McGandy Staff Writer The swirling pattern of politi cal and personal conflict of Ros- mersholm saw both its realization and undoing on the Coleman Thea ter stage in a parents' weekend pro duction of Henrik Ibsen's drama. Despite fine acting on the part of the Bucknell company and expert directing by Bob Gainer, it was clear that the ambitious Ibsen, often considered the father of the realist genre, had crafted a play which took a theater company beyond lim its of reason and credibility. A drama that had spiraled upward with wondrous tension and intensity for three acts, collapsed under its own weight in the fourth leaving the cast unable to salvage the emotion and anxiety which had undergirded the entire structure. Yet, the Rosmersholm script, particularly in the first three acts, did create moments of anxious beauty which allowed the cast to match Ibsen's writing with their tal ents. The performances of Mary K. Cullison as Rebecca West and Andrew Garman as John Rosmer were particularly noteworthy. Dur ing Monday night's performance both actors were able to fully embody their characters in almost flawless performances which went far beyond stage direction and sug gested the passion and turmoil which tormented the souls of West and Rosmer. Garman effectively conveyed the rarified passion of Rosmer as the bourgeois intellectual. The soft ness of his voice and frailty with which he held his body allowed Garman to create the aura of a man who would necessarily retreat to the certainty and comfort of the ideals of his family tradition. Indeed, John Rosmer came alive in all his sad beauty and weakness in Garman's performance. It is the character of West upon which the entirety of Rosmer- sholm's action turned and Cullison performed this crucial role quite well as she was able to render the many nuances and subtleties exhib ited in the multifarious character of Rebecca West. It was West's devel opment as a character which guided and determined Rosmer's path and her personal history and acts which provided the network of intrigue which undergirded the immediate context of the drama. Cullison was brilliant is this crucial role; her voice was meas ured and calculatedly appealing as she directed the thoughts and words of the other characters. Cul- lison's strength was her ability to convey meaning and emotion silently with a gesture or the subtle changing of her posture. The expressiveness of Cullison's eyes and facial features belied the calm of her voice and exhibited the social turmoil in which she and the other characters were engaged. As the play faltered in the consumed in the horrific necessity of West and Rosmer's suicidal act, could only laugh, albeit a bit nervously. Director Bob Gainer, com menting on Ibsen's script, said that while the play is realistic in charac ter, there is a strong element of the poetical; the last act, then, would represent a poetical leap and not an incongruity in a realistic structure. ""Although the play is realistic in form, the accumulation and pro gression of the actions of the char acters are metaphorical and poetic in nature and artificially represent the change of consciousness in the characters lives,"" Gainer explained. Photo by Debra Cook ""Rosmersholm"" was performed on campus last week by the Depart ment of Theatre and Dance. Pictured here are Mary Cullison '91 as Rebecca and Andrew Garman '91 as Rosmer. fourth act, Cullison and Garman, along with the rest of the cast, remained consistent and strong in their roles while, unfortunately, the writing itself unraveled their char acters. In this final scene the inter meshing of private and public, the realms of the emotional and intel lectual, resolves itself as West and Rosmer are compelled by the spir its of tradition and the guilt they invoke to forsake their professed ideals. In the final moments as West and Rosmer walk arm in arm toward the swift water of the mill- race in order to sacrifice their lives where Rosmer's wife Beata, at the prompting of West, had months before, the tragedy became absurd. Ibsen's characters strangely offered melodrama in the place of tragedy, words came forth which seemed sudden and mechanical, and the audience, rather than being"

Speaking,
"""Specific Blights""","By Lee Guzofski Staff Writer Hello Bucknell! I hope you all had as wonderful a break as I did. I hope everyone got the opportunity to take in a fine fea ture film or two. Well, I sure did! I saw Pacific Heights, starring Matthew Modine, Melanie Grif fith, and Michael Keaton. It was an interesting movie, to be sure, but it did have a few specific problems... Modine stars as a sheepish husband named Drake Goodman, Griffith plays his girlfriend, and Keaton delivers a stunning por trayal of the villain Carter Hayes. The plot centers around Modine's character trying to prove that he is the man about the house and will take care of everything. That is, everything after the fact that the couple has sunk themselves deep in a financial hole after pur chasing their dream home (a ""unique fixer-upper opportu nity""). In essence, they are mort gaged up to their respective wazoos and have placed all of their time, effort, and love into this house. Enter Keaton... Michael Keaton's character is indeed what makes this film. He plays a man who is incredibly intelligent and makes his living off of using other people, so much so that he generally ruins his victims' lives. The character of Carter Hayes is so compel- lingly evil that the entire move eventually revolves around him. Quite a far cry from Mr. Mom and Batman... However, the movie is just too bizarre, blatant, and random to ever really succeed. For exam ple, Modine's character, the hero, is named Goodman. He lives in a beautiful all-white house in a friendly, ""Howdy neighbor"" type town. Then we have Keaton, whose entrance is made driving a black Porsche, appearing over a hill. Please... My favorite part of the film comes when the Home Shopping Club is on TV offering a ""Faux Pony Desk Set"", that's right, a desk set covered in faux pony fur. The desk set, analogous to the film, is intriguing, differ ent, but a little too blatant and weird to be of much value. In summation, this film is interest ing, but not worth full price. Kea ton's performance does, how ever, make it a possibility whenever it come to the Campus Theater. Have a nice yesterday and a pleasant next Thursday. ""The very extravagant theatrical gesture of the suicide represents the poetic and symbolic climax of the play."" Ibsen's writing, though, was inadequate in suggesting the poten tial of the characters of West and Rosmer to make such poetical leaps. There are minor intimations of the extreme act that concludes the play such as West's statement as the end of second act that she may ""go the way go the way Beata went."" But these words are quite inadequate to suggest the severity of character would be necessary to determine suicide to be the proper response to their responsibility for Beata's death. Aside from these deficien cies in the script, all other aspects of the production--including the preparation of the set and the light ing--were of a professional quality. Speaking after the week end's performances, Gainer lav ished praise on the cast. ""Ibsen knew that he was creating very psy chologically complex characters and I was pleased with the ability, commitment, and talent that the Bucknell cast brought to their roles. I was impressed and edified by the Bucknell cast."" Indeed, it is precisely the complexity of Ibsen's characters, the twisting and intertwining of identities into a creative fabric, that makes Rosmersholm a drama of interest. As a result the actors, espe cially Cullison and Garman, had to not only define their own charac ters, but enter into a creative dynamic of revelation; each charac ter being continually recreated and the actors necessarily being in tune with this growth and in a sense play a number of characters. Rosmersholm is a social and psychological drama set within the social and political turmoil of Norway in 1886. At Rosmersholm, the family seat of the clerical Ros mer family and a bastion of local tradition, the struggle between the forces of theoretical liberalism and conservatism takes concrete form. John Rosmer and Rebecca West attempt to create a new and enlight ened life for themselves in, as Ros mer states, a ""sense of calm and happy innocence"" and Rosmer makes preparations to ""create a lit tle light and happiness in those places where for so many years the Rosmer family has created nothing but darkness and misery."" Yet, while West and Ros mer profess their faith in a new humanity, they do so under the gaze of the family patriarchs and matriarchs whose portraits hang in the parlour. This plan for a new and liberated life is confronted by the character of Dr. Kroll, authentically rendered by Tom Quinn. The loud and crude Kroll, the brother of the deceased Beata, undermines West and Rosmer's plan with his conflic- tual ideology, his knowledge of Rebecca's questionable past with her mentor Dr. West, and the ghost of Beata that he bears with him. Ultimately it would be these rememberances of the past that would undo both Rosmer and West as they both take their life in order to atone for their past acts, to appease the shades that haunt Ros mersholm. As West said in the first act, ""its the dead that cling to Rosmersholm."" Kroll, then, represents the audible voice of the past, of tradi tion, which not only opposes Ros mer and West, but condemns them and their dreams. Quinn effectively presented the rhetoric of Kroll, replete with abrasive and somewhat hysterical voice of a Norwegian conservative fearing that ""discord and subversion"" was on the verge of dissolving traditional society. If Quinn's performance could be said to be lacking in any manner, it was that his creation of Kroll's charac ter through facial expressions and gesture which was not on par with his verbal presentation. The focus of Rosmer sholm, though, was the intellectual and emotional development of West and Rosmer and the demise of their notions concerning human ity due to the corrosive force of tra dition. To this end the lesser char acters of the play served to further"
Alumnus performs in,
Weis center tonight,"By Cynthia Levinson Staff Writer Hang your hat on home coming and go straight to the Weis center tonight! Alumni and students alike should find tonight's opera-in-concert perfor mance of Handel's Acis and Galatea of great interest for more reasons than one. Handel's two-act operatic pastoral was written in 1718. It is the ""tragic story of the sea nymph Galatea and her lover, the young shepherd Acis."" Galatea is also loved by the jealous Polyphemus, but his love is not returned by Galatea. For this reason, Polyphe mus crushes Acis beneath a boul der. The grief stricken Galatea transforms Acis into a river bear ing the same name. The empassioned opera will be conducted by noted conductor and Bucknell graduate of 1973, Rudolph Palmer. Palmer was a music major at Bucknell and is an active alumnus. He is an acknowledged expert in Baroque repertory, and has taken a special interest unearthing, performing, and recording a number of rela tively unknown works. Some of these works, such as Baroque Cantatas as Versailles and ""Romantic Handel Cantatas"" have received quite a bit of acclaim in the music world. As a musician, Palmer appears quite frequently in con cert. He plays the piano and organ and is also a member of the con ducting and composition faculty of the Mannes College of Music. In addition, Palmer functions as associate conductor for the Fair- field County Chorale. He has composed quite a number of pieces, some of which were com- Courtesy of Public Relations Rudolph Palmer '73 majored in music here at Bucknell. missioned for the New York Bas- son Quartet, the Amor Artis Cho rale and the Fitzwilliam String Quartet. Tonight's performance of Acis and Galatea will feature the Brewer Ensemble of original instruments, soloitsts Julianne Baird, tenor Grayson Hirst, tenor Frederick Urrey, and bass- baritone John Ostendorf. The Rooke Chapel Choir will also be featured in tonights performance. They will be conducted by Wil liam Payn, an associate professor of music here at Bucknell. This opera will be the first performance in the Weis Center's Reverbera tions Series. Tonight's performance will begin at 8 p.m.. Tickets are availa ble at the Weis Center Box Office for $20. Everyone is encouraged to attend. It is a special occaision when Bucknell is able to feature its own students, faculty, and alumni in a performance along with other noted musicians and performers. The entire production should be one of a very high cali- bur and is definitely worth seeing. the character development of West and Rosmer, prefiguring and guid ing their movement toward self- realization. The minor characters of the production were all rendered with talent and a concern for authenticity. Emery as Mrs. Hels- eth, William Lippincott as the aes thetic anarchist Ulrik Brendel, and Joshua D. Brinen as the liberal politico Peter Mortensgaard all complemented the central charac ters in addition to their solid indi vidual performances. Lippincott and Emery had the difficult task of portraying aging characters as Gainer chose to use a cast entirely composed of students. Makeup and costume could not quite render the youthful Lippincott aged, but his clever per formance certainly brought out the eccentric and tragic hollowness of Brendel's revolt against tradition."

Indeed, Gainer opted to accentuate Emery's age and remake Mrs. Hels- eth as a young maid. While Emery was placed in a difficult in this dif ficult position Gainer and Ibsen she performed well and effectively evoked the white horses of Rosmer sholm and placed the dead continu ally before West and Rosmer. In the role of Mortens gaard, Brinen was consistent and emanated the solidity and practical ity of the politician who knew the political struggle to be, not one of ideals, but power and influence. As a freshman, Brinen shows promise and should be seen often on the Coleman Theater stage."

Misperceptions,"Students have the administration worried, and rightfully so. With the current upheaval of our social-residential system, crisis in the Department of Security and Safety and growing student perceptions that the administration is taking a ""could care less"" attitude toward student life, morale at Bucknell has sunk to new lows. The Trustee Implementation Planning (TIP) process continues to mystify most students. While rumors about changes run rampant, TIP subcommittees have yet to publicly announce any proposals for implementation next fall. Students, and the entire University Community, are in limbo, not knowing whether they can sign leases for apartments in town or how their Greek organizations will be affected a year from now. Security and Safety continues to be seen as a threat, rather than an entity with our safety and security in mind. Students question why sexual harrassment on the golf course receives little attention in comparison with the Uni versity's unyielding breaches in enforcing the alcohol policy. From the reaction of security officers, it is clear that a very significant rift has developed between the student body and the Department of Security and Safety -- rifts that should have never been allowed to develop and seemingly grow larger day by day. For the first time since the divestment demonstrations of the early '80s, students are coming together to confront the administration, only this time the issues are closer to home. Many students view the administration as the new ""evil empire"" and are displeased with what they see as its inaction on students' issues. Survey results released today indicate a clear drop in student satisfaction with both Bucknell and several key administrators. All of these factors add fuel to the fire and yield a potent result -- widespread and overwhelming dissatisfaction. But are these perceptions accurate? A close look behind the scenes reveals an administration that is not just concerned with student morale, but one that is actively pursuing the answers to our problems. Bucknell is in a state of transition; with vast changes in our social-residential system underway, we must realize that confusion and misunderstanding are common components of the process. Through TIP, the University is attempting to dispel rumor and replace it with fact. It is only a matter of weeks before students will be getting their fust glimpse of what the Bucknell of the '90s will look like. With a new director in place at Security and Safety, changes are already underway. A permanent advisory com mittee is being formed to look into the day-to-day operations of security and recommend changes. Our new direc tor has demonstrated in a short ten days that he is concerned with the mistakes of the past and addressing the con cerns of the present. Changes seem to be underway on all fronts. As the Universtiy Community pushes through these months of transition, students must begin to see the light at the end of the tunnel. Be assurred that your needs and concerns are being addressed by the administration. In the weeks ahead changes in structure and practice within our University will readily become apparent. Now, however, is not the time to stop. Continue to voice your concerns, but with the realization that our adminis tration is genuinely concerned and willing to act"

Bucknell Security Officer,
responds to allegations,"To the Editor: NO MORE!! I can no longer sit idly or quietly by and read and listen to the campus community blast the Department of Security and Safety. I have been a member of the Depart ment for the past eight and a half years, and I have a few comments I wish to make.... Our main mission as Offi cers is the pro tection of life and property on this campus. This includes, but is not limited to, students, staff, faculty, and the many hun dreds of visitors we have here at any given time. How would you like to be responsible for the lives of that many people at one time, make split second decisions, and pray to a higher power that you've made the right choice?? How would you like to have an employee suffer a massive heart attack and die in your arms, knowing you've done everything humanly possible to sustain his life? I cried. How would you like to have a student you never knew take her last breath in your arms, watch her die, having done every thing possible to save her, and find out later she had a terminal disease, and no one could have saved her. I cried. How would you like, along with a fellow Officer, to try and control the bleeding from a severed artery of a student who had just fallen through the Botany Greenhouse, and mirac ulously save his life. I cried. I could go on and on about other true inci dents that have occurred on cam pus, but I think you get my point. I am the Security Officer who patrols down Fraternity Road at 10 p.m., and as I go by you yell, ""F-- You Security! for no reason what soever. I am the same Officer whom you call at 3 a.m. because your friend or roommate is choking to death on their own vomit, because they drank too much alco hol. I am the Officer who tries to control the bleeding after you've severed part of your thumb off, because you were drunk, couldn't find your dorm key, and punched out the window so you could get in. I am the same Officer who com forts you when you have been physically or sexually assaulted, and then tries to find the person(s) responsible for the assault. I am the same Officer who stands in a crowd of fifty drunk students fighting, try ing to stop them before they seri ously injure or permanently maim each other. I am the Officer who takes your report of stolen CDs from your room, feeling frustrated because you have left your room unlocked for hours and just can't understand why someone would steal your belongings. Again, I could go on and on, but hopefully you get my point I believe what I'm trying to say is simply, ""I HAVE A JOB TO DO!"" I like my job. I like and care a great deal about my fellow Offi cers. We are not here to harass you, we are here to assist and help you. And should you break any Commonwealth of Pennsylvania laws, whether they be criminal or vehicular, you are responsible! Contrary to popular belief, this cam pus is part of the real world, not just the infa mous ""Bucknell Bubble."" So next time you are swearing at or flipping off a Security Officer for giving you a parking ticket or writing you up for a conduct vio lation, remember, ""ITS THEIR JOB!""

TIP com m ittees request,
m ore cam pus participation,"To the Editor: In recent weeks, a great deal of interest, concern, and commen tary about the Trustee Implementa tion Planning (TIP) program has developed on campus. We would like to respond to these concerns to gen erate a better understanding of the program throughout the Univer sity community. There seems to be some frus tration with the Trustees' recom mendations for change; some of the faculty feel that their ideological concerns were not addressed, while the Greek population feels threat- ened and worries about extinction. Accordingly, some segments of the campus community feel that the TIP program is a tool of the administration, to be used only to lend legitimacy to a foregone con- clusion. Others worry that it will be dominated by political agendas, and that parochial interests on campus will control the outcome of the pro gram. A common concern among critics of TIP is that it doesn't insure that every segment of the community will have input into the process. The TIP program is an inclu sive program: It is intended to develop recommendations for change based on input from the entire campus community, not to be run by an elite group which then ships its recom mendations to dif ferent organiza tions so that they may rubber stamp ""we like/don't like your proposal"" onto the package. These organiza tions need to be involved from the ground up. We only have a few months to complete an enormous task: promoting ""rubber stamping"" See PARTICIPATION, page 9"

Parent comments on ranking,To the Editor: The 1990 edition of
U.S.,"News and World Report's annual ranking of colleges placed Buck nell in the first quartile of National Liberal Arts Colleges, not the sec ond quartile as you mistakenly reported on the front page of the October 12 issue of The Bucknel lian. There are 35 colleges in each quartile, with the exception of the first, which has 36. [Of course, each quartile ought, by definition, to include 25%. For some reason USN&WR chose to include 141, giving four quartiles of 36,35,35, 35.] You may have confused the 'first 25' with the first quartile (25%). We were not in the first 25 but we were in the first 36, which comprised the first quartile, roughly, out of 141. Notice, also, that Bucknell is not ranked at the top of the eleven listed on pg. 126 ( USN&WR ) as you imply. The list ing is alphabetical. As not to add to the confusion, understand that the USN&WR heading on pg. 126 is misleading and should read '...the rest of quartile one.' Sincerely, Philip Silvestri October 19,1990"

Flexible benefits program proposed by,
Administration needs a second look,
Picture it: burger boxes,
outlasting the pyramids,"By Mark Leister Staff Writer A very important decision must be made in the near future by Bucknell employees. A propo sal to change the present employee benefits system to a new ""flexible benefits"" sys tem has been put forth by the Administration and a great number of peo ple simply do not understand the potentially unfavorable ramifications of the new system. Most traditional benefits programs require each employee to contribute a set amount to the program; that money is then divided by a previously devised formula and every employee gets the same amount of coverage in each area. This system presents prob lems, however, because not every person needs the same amount and type of coverage. For exam ple, some employees may have spouses with outstanding medical benefits. Why should the Buck nell employee have to pay a per centage into Bucknell's medical plan? It's wasteful. Enter, flexible benefits. Since each person has different needs and desires, this option allows employees to determine where their funds will go. For example, more money can be pushed into a dental plan while less can go to the medical plan. Even better is the aspect that if you don't think you need a large amount of coverage or you have other coverage, you can cancel your Bucknell benefits plan. It sounds great--but there's one important flaw. Insurance and benefits are based upon one necessary element: a payout coffer. Participants pay premiums which go into this fund and the insurance company pays bills out of it. Since the majority of this money comes from the healthy, there is nothing more important than keeping the young, low-risk employees in the program because they contribute necessary funds into the coffer while removing very lit tle themselves. Young, healthy people pay into the system as a means to two important ends. First, they protect themselves for the future; money paid in while they are young and healthy will be used to take care of them when they get older. Second, the money that is paid by healthy folk comprises the main body of a fund out of which claims are now paid. This system is ancient and proven. By encouraging the young to protect their futures, society has been able to care for the sick and elderly. The flexible benefits pro gram, however, could very well undermine this time-proven system. For example, as young, low-risk people begin to leave the Bucknell program, the monetary foundation begins to disappear, leaving only those who need Bucknell's benefits or consider themselves to be at high-risk for illness. Instead of the fund staying relatively full, it begins to decline--no one knows exactly how fast, but it declines nonetheless. What is the reaction? The insurance company realizes that if the foundation dwindles away to nothing, it will soon be paying Bucknell employees' claims out of its own pockets. Its only recourse is to raise the pre miums of those still in the sys tem. This increase can lead to a two-fold effect First, Bucknell's system becomes less and less com petitive because its rates keep ris ing--much to the dismay of Buck nell's employees, this gets very expensive and it causes even more people to seek better rates else where. Second, if the premiums can't increase fast enough for the insurance company to feel it has a secure fund, it will cancel Buck nell's plan altogether. This may sound like an exag geration, but it isn't  The fact is, the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts is deal ing with this problem right now. They implemented a program simi lar to the one Bucknell is proposing with comparable flexible options and the identical provider, Blue Cross and Blue Shield (BCBS). The problem developed because BCBS requires a certain level of ""employee involvement"" from the insured institution. When this level goes below a cer tain minimum limit the insurance company cancels the program. The College of Holy Cross is dan gerously close to that minimum limit and BCBS sees that its pay out coffer is getting too low. If the college isn't careful, it could have its benefits program dropped. The harsh reality of this example is that this situation could very well occur here. Buck nell is dealing with the same insu rance company and a system which would allow low-risk indi viduals the option to leave part of the plan. It is possible that with an exodus of employees from Buck- nell's program and consequen tially diminished funds, BCBS could decide that Bucknell is sim ply too great a risk. But this situation would arise years from now and some people simply don't realize how far ahead one must look to see flaws in a system. Others, how ever, have been able to sense the problematic nature of the flexible benefits system. At last Monday's faculty meeting, many professors admitted to hav ing little under standing of the new system's ramifications. These statements are proof positive that there needs to be more discussion of the proposed system among Bucknell's employees before a decision is made. The new flexible benefits package has its advantages...and its disadvantages. Make sure you know what you're getting into, before you get into it By Paul Shrivastava Each year we generate more than 150 million tons of garbage, in the form of 250 million tires, 2 bil lion disposable batteries, 28 billion glass bottles and jars, 50 million tons of paper and 18 billion dispos able diapers. We then dump these materials into one of our overbur dened waste sites where they sit for hundreds of years. This year 50% of our cities will run out of landfill space to store these treasures. We are in the throes of a garbage crisis. The worst part of this prob lem is that we are headed down the wrong track to its solution. Corpo rations, government agencies and environmentalists have enthusiasti cally endorsed the idea that recy cling is the solution. This is wrong headed for two reasons. First, actual levels of recycling in the United States are abysmally low. Less than 5% of garbage generated is recycled. We generate more trash each month than we recycle each year. cling has conditioned the American public to believe that it alone is responsible for the problem and for finding the solution. Consumers are not the source of garbage; they only discard the excess that manufactur ers put into products. Waste disinte grates so slowly because most products and packages are highly over-engineered by manufacturers. Primary responsibility for the solu tion should be in their hands, where it rightly belongs. They design the containers that are built to outlast the pyramids. Certainly, it is easier to regulate a few thousand manu facturers than to coordinate the recycling efforts of 200 million consumers. Recycling is a useful idea that needs to be encouraged, but should not be mistaken for a solu tion. Besides, it is impossible to effectively recycle significant amounts of waste without investing in an expensive recycling infra structure. Countries like Japan that have developed successful recy cling programs have done so by providing a variety of laws, moni toring agencies, municipal services, equipment, personnel and informa tion to make them work. Recycling also heavily depends on action by citizens. This dependence on voluntarism is the Achilles heel of the entire idea of recycling. Let's face it. Can a soci ety in which less than half the peo ple vote or fill out census forms be expected to voluntarily recycle its garbage? Probably not. The real solution to the gar bage crisis lies in not generating unnecessary garbage in the first place. Product manufacturers think of disposability as producing inex pensive and short-life products that consumers can afford to simply throw away. They need to rethink this concept. Product design should seek to minimize not only the cost of the product, but also the cost of disposing it. The real cost of dis posing a product, such as a tire or battery, is incurred over hundreds of years of its useless life in land fills, and may be more than the cost of the product itself. Packaging manufacturers need to design materials that are relative to expected product life. If the time taken from production to consumption of coffee, or deter gent, or soft drinks, is six months, do we need to wrap them in mate rial that lasts for 500 years? Consumers can help by sub stituting disposable products with renewable ones whenever possible. In fact, renewable products often turn out to be less expensive in the long run. For example, used over five years, an electric razor costs about $15 per year. Disposable razors cost about $35 per year and also generate 750 pieces of plastic and metal, as opposed to one piece of waste from an electric razor. If we fail to implement effec tive garbage control strategies, we may invite the fate envisioned by a satirist paraphrasing Robert Frost: Some say the world will end in fire Some say in ice, Some say it will go with the bang of a big explosive device. But at the risk of sounding sarcastic, I say the world will choke on plastic. Editor's Note: Paul Shrivastava is a management professor and edi tor-in-chief of Industrial Crisis Quarterly.

The key is understanding the other point of view. The faculty needs to under stand that they cannot educate in a vacuum. The construction of a Uto pia has little worth when its lessons cannot be practically applied ""beyond the bubble."" Likewise, the students must leant to see through the faculty's eyes; if students do not attend this University primarily to learn, what purpose do they have here, but to detract from the learn ing of others? TIP is attempting to establish a middle ground, with concessions to both sides and an idea of a clear social structure to strive for--one that supports the best that society has to offer, including input from all parties in decision making. It is here that TIP has its greatest difficulty: we cannot draft appropriate members of the campus community--we can only hope that they will choose to participate. If there is concern among the faculty that Greeks will dominate the com mittee on Greek life, it is fruitless to avoid the issue and point to the committee's recommendation as biased after the fact. The faculty must be involved from the outset. Each recommendation will be the total of ideas expressed during committee meetings; if a segment of the community has no input, it has no one to fault but itself if the TIP results seem unappetizing. Presently there are two groups that are woefully under represented in the program: faculty and freshmen, which is discourag ing, since these are perhaps the two most important groups. They will bear the effects of the recommenda tions long after the rest of the present student community is gone. We are not asking that every one on campus join a committee, but we do need to hear more ideas. All committee meetings are open-- attend one and give an opinion or an idea. We want the new recommen dations to fit the campus easily, not to be forced on the community from above, and the only way to ensure that is to take a measure from every angle. For that, we need your help. The TIP committees October 12,1990 p a g e  14 T h e B u c k n e llia n October 26. 1990"

Football champs of 1965 honored,"By Darren Millman Staff Writer When the 5-2 Bison football squad returns to Christy Mathew- son-Memorial Stadium tomorrow to clash with the Red Raiders of Col gate, it will also represent the homecoming of a Bucknell football team from years ago. At halftime of the game, the university will be honoring the 1965 Middle Atlantic Conference champions as they cele brate their 25 year reunion. The 1965 Bison went 6-3, continuing the winning ways of the Lambert Cup champion team from the year before. Head Coach Car- roll Huntress directed the Bison to their first MAC title in his first sea son at Bucknell. Huntress went on to coach at the University of Ken tucky and then moved to the pro fessional ranks as an assistant coach for the New York Jets. Tight end Tom Mitchell '66 concluded one of Bucknell's most illustrious athletic careers, catching 59 passes for 850 yards and six touchdowns. Mitchell still holds Bucknell receiving records for career receptions (173), yards (2358), and touchdown receptions (18)."
Injuries:,
An athlete's greatest fear,"By Jamie Diaferia Staff Writer In the 1988 NBA Finals between the Detroit Pistons and the L A. Lakers, Isiah Thomas of the Pistons hobbled his way around the court as he played with a severely sprained ankle. Most people would have been on crutches for days. Similarly, Lawrence Taylor of the New York Giants played several football games last year with a broken ankle. Under normal conditions, Taylor would have been in a cast for weeks. Scenes such as those just described raise several important questions that pertain to more than just professional sports. High school and college players are limping onto sports fields each week despite the risks of serious injury. Unfortunately, the reasons for these common occurrences are not completely clear, and the chances that change will occur are very slim. The problem of athletes playing with serious injuries is one that is not only relevant to professional sports. The Bucknell football team, just like any other college athletic program, places a great amount of emphasis on winning. As a result, the pressure that exists to perform well undoubtedly filters down from the coaching staff to the players. Each player knows in the back of his mind that injuries do not help the team; consequently, they attempt to cover up those inju ries that will keep them out of the next game. Often these injuries are more serious than the player is aware of, and more damage could be done than what he thinks is possible. Mike Augsberger '91, a free safety, is an example of a player who might have become permanently hurt had he not have listened to the Bucknell trainers. In a game earlier this season, Augsberger injured his shoulder, but he felt that the problem was not that serious. After being checked by Mark Keppler, Bucknell Head Athletic Trainer, the senior felt that he should be allowed to play because the pain was tolerable. Keppler and Associate Athletic Trainer, Barry McGlumphy, diagnosed that nerve damage had been done to Augs berger, and that if he continued to play could be detrimental to his health. Though he protested, said McGlumphy, the co-captain now realizes that it would have been foolish to play. While it is clear that there is a strong desire to play in a game though injured, the reasons why are not quite as understandable. Den nis Barnes '91 is a player whose football career at Bucknell is over as a result of a tear in the anterior cruciate ligament of his right knee. His experiences with playing injured have led him to formulate a theory about the question of why there is such a strong desire to play hurt. ""You really have to love the game,"" said Barnes. ""Sometimes players aren't ready to give it up. When you're in the game, the pain is not that bad. You block it out. It's the next day that it hurts. You just have to learn to suck up the pain."" McGlumphy agreed with Barnes that players have a remarkable ability to block out the pain. ""It depends on the player, and whether he has the ability to overcome physiological pain,"" said McGlumphy. ""I've seen some players that become so intense you can't even talk to them during the game."" McGlumphy feels that the sentiments of players like Barnes, are what ends player's careers, as they develop a sense of being ""invincible."" ""Athletes tend not to look at the 'countability factor,""' said McGlumphy. ""Players do not realize that we are responsible for them. They don't look down the road. All they see are the immediate rewards. They know that once the playing days are over, the glory's all gone."" As a result, McGlumphy added, players lie to the trainers about not having injuries in order to not miss games. ""They will make their own decisions based on passed experiences with injuries,"" said McGlumphy. The trainers have an important role in the decision about whether a individual should be allowed to play or not. There are sev eral factors which enter into the decision of the trainer because they are accountable to some degree, should a player have a major injury in a game in which he should not have played. One point for the trainer to consider would be the field of study for the players. For example, a medical student with a fractured finger would be less likely to be given the go ahead over a psychology major due to the need for dexterity in the medical field. Another factor would be the pressure from the coaching staff for a particular player to be on the field come Saturday. Often the desire to win is more important than the player's comfort during a game. This is not to say, however, that a coach would send a player on the field if it were known that perma nent damage could result. Basically, if the trainer is aware of the injury, it is up to him to give the players permission to play each week. Clearly there is a wide ranging problem throughout the country with athletes either lying about injuries, or simply ignoring them while they place themselves in great danger. The rewards evidently outweigh the negatives in the eyes of the players, as the immediate glory is ultimately more powerful a force than the pain one feels after the game. There are hidden risks involved that most athletes are not aware of, however, as the trainers are more qualified than the players to assess conditions such as nerve injuries. Unfortunately, it is only a matter of time before a seemingly trivial injury becomes a tragic fatal ity, and the athletic community will finally wake up. The Oakland Raiders of the American Football League signed Mitchell in 1966, and he went on to enjoy a long and successful profes sional career, predominantly with the Baltimore Colts. Defensive back/quarterback Bob Marks '67 described Mitchell as ""the cream of the crop. He had good speed for someone 6-3, 220 pounds."" Mitchell and Marks both earned the honor of being named to the All-Pennsylvania team. ""Multi-faceted"" was the word which Marks chose to describe the 1965 Bison, and judging from the fact that no less than six Bucknell players were members of the All- Conference squad, his assessment holds true. Mitchell, tackle Paul Maczu- zak '68, center Geoffrey Traub '66, defensive end Ed ""Bub"" Morgan '66, defensive lineman Jim Henn '68, and Marks represented the Bison on the All-Conference team. Bill Lerro '66 utilized pin point passing to complement his drop-back quarterbacking style. Lerro completed 93 of 171 passes for 1303 yards and four touchdowns. Coach Huntress utilized the skills of Marks to spell Lerro and keep opposing defenses off bal ance. Marks' roll-out style allowed him to complete 29 of 45 passes for 379 yards and eight touch downs. He also rushed for 249 yards on 42 carries with five touchdowns. Tailback Bob Coons '66 led the Bison ground game running for 662 yards and seven touchdowns on 153 carries en route to the MAC rushing title. When he wasn't recovering from injuries, tailback Bruce Smith '68 rushed for 379 yards and four touchdowns on 88 carries. Other standouts included tight end Ron Kinsey '66, who hauled in 33 passes for 455 yards and one touchdown, and Don Len- hard '67, who caught 12 for 188 yards and two touchdowns. The members of the team win have no shortage of exciting memories to recall as they come together 25 years later. The high light of the season was the victory over Delaware in which Marks orchestrated a fourth quarter 97- yard touchdown drive to clinch the MAC title. At least twenty players are expected to attend the Homecom ing Day ceremonies. First Row (Left to Right)--R. Kinsey, J. Omsberg, J. Smith, B. Lerro, T. Cox, Capt. J. Traub, B. Coons, J. Freeman, R.

Joe Markulike '90 takes,
his shot at pro baseball,"Photo courtesy of PRO CARDS Markulike '90 has realized what for most is just a dream as he is pic tured here in his own professional baseball card. By Chris Drowne According to New York Mets scout Pete Smith, ""About one out of every 10,000 Little Leaguers makes it as far as the minors."" Bucknell's Joe Marku like '90 beat those odds. Signed as a free agent this past June, Markulike played for the Idaho Falls Braves of the Pio neer League. This single-A short season introduces players to the roller coaster life of professional baseball. Late night bus trips from Salt Lake City, Utah, to Medicine Hat, Canada, wear on the players, as well as performing on bug- infested playing fields. But they do it for the ""moments in the sun,"" such as signing an autograph on your own baseball card for a young fan, giv ing hitting clinics, and putting on a professional uniform. The decision to play with the Braves was not as easy as most would think. Markulike, a GTE Academic All-America from 1988 - 1990, declined a substan tial job offer from General Elec tric in favor of the league mini mum $850 per month. Marulike said, ""The G.E. offer was tough to pass on, but my grandfather, uncle, and other members of my family passed up their shots to play baseball because they had to work. I didn't want to miss my shot."" The long bus trips provided some of the more memorable moments of the season. While traveling to Salt Lake City for a crucial game in the pennant race, the bus was forced to pull over to the side of the road around 1 a.m. due to low air pressure in the air brakes. After an unsuccessful attempt to fix the problem, the bus- driver and an assistant coach walked to try and call for help. When they failed to return, the manager sent Markulike and another player out to find them, which they did. The clock showed 6 a.m. before another bus would pick the team up for their game. Understandably, the Braves com mitted countless errors in helping Salt Lake City to an easy win that afternoon. The Williamsport native attracted many scouts to Bucknell with his .395 career batting aver age. In his senior season Markulike finished fourth in the nation in bat ting with a .454 average, as well as in the top ten in triples. The Chicago White Sox had shown the most interest but didn't draft him after selecting a number of middle infielders in the early rounds. Markulike is still not positive about his future. He's currently tak ing graduate courses in mechanical engineering at Bucknell. After this semester, he will likely go to work for General Electric. One future event that Marku like is sure about is his upcoming marriage to fellow Bucknellian Tif fany Cook in June. ""If (the Braves) call me up and tell me that they want me to play for them, I might return,"" said Markulike. ""But there are many factors that made me believe that the minor league lifestyle wasn't for M A O  *>> me.

The,
Bucknellian,"October 26, 1990 By Anne Taback Staff Writer The Bucknell women's soc cer team continues to struggle as a varsity squad in its inaugural year of play, as the Lady Bison lost two games before Fall Break, falling to Elizabethtown and Penn State. The consecutive defeats of these two games drops Bucknell's record to 1-6 for the season. Elizabethtown, a nationally ranked powerhouse, was probably the toughest team the Lady Bison will have to face all season, but the Penn State game proved to be a game that Bucknell will remember as ""the one that got away."" Bucknell will hope to break its losing streak today when it hosts Lehigh at 7:30 p.m. Although Elizabethtown got the win, the Lady Bison played extremely well in defeat, losing 1-0. The first and only goal of the game came at 22:55 in the first half, when Elizabethtown marched through the Bucknell defenders, as the Lady Bison simply misjudged the ball. After many Bucknell defenders had a chance to make a play, the ball rolled to Lady Jay forward Jocelyn Jarzynski, who blasted a shot from six yards out for the game-winning score. The Elizabethtown game marked the only contest all season in which Bucknell has been held scoreless. However, Head Coach Toby Lovecchio was optimistic. ""We played hard,"" he said. ""We held a good offensive team to one goal."" Despite the one miscue, the defensive players hung tough, lead ing Lovecchio to assess, ""We played the best that we could possi bly play on defense.' Shannon Smith '92 played superior one-on-one defense, mark ing one of the best offensive players in Division III. Goalkeeper Kim Fckel '93 had an outstanding game in net, compiling sixteen saves. However, the Lady Bison offense struggled, as they were held to only ten shots. Lovecchio described, ""We had some nice opportunities in the second half but we failed to capital ize on them. To increase the chances of scoring you obviously have to take more shots."" He concluded, ""The offensive punch wasn't there but our defense kept us in it."" Sweeper Stephanie Porcaro '93 said that the team was ""psyched before the game...wc knew that we had to play well."" She felt that the main problem with the Lady Bison is that they are inconsistent with their offensive surges. However, she added, ""If the game had gone on longer, we were so intense that we would have scored at some point."" Co-captain Christina Basclga '91 agrees. ""We played an incredi ble defensive game,"" said Baselga. ""If we had ten more minutes we definitely would have taken it all the way. We had a big second half of the game."" Penn State proved to be a dis aster for Bucknell. On paper, the teams appeared evenly matched, but the Nittany Lions dominated for a 2-1 victory. Lovecchio said ""We played without intensity; their heads weren't into it. It was the most non productive first half of soccer that I've seen them play all year."" The first goal came for the Nittany Lions at 17:00, when for ward Amy Convoy took a cross from the left wing to score. Their second goal came late in the half, when Penn State forward Dina Dinacci scored on a rebound off Fekel at 43:00. Down 2-0 as the second half started, the Lady Bison played bet ter. But the Nittany Lions were still passing better and winning all the ""50-50 balls."" Bucknell was able to avoid the shutout with less than six min utes to go in the game, when Por caro chipped a direct kick from twenty-five yards out that descended into the penalty area. Midfielder Julie Cooling '94 col lected the ball, and from eight yards out, put the ball into the back of the net at 80:00. Lovecchio commented, ""It was an even team, no better than us, with the same kind of talent we have. From my viewpoint they wanted it a lot more than we did. We had decent scoring opportuni ties that were negated, but our defense in the first half wasn't as solid."" Baselga assessed, ""We played a very slow game and we were caught off guard. We're ten times better than Penn State but we couldn't put it together."" Porcaro agreed. ""We just fell apart,"" she said. ""We couldn't do anything right."" The Lady Bison clash with Lehigh today. Lovecchio finds, ""Lehigh is no better than the Lady Bison, but we will have to play well if they expect to win. We have to get back on track and be men tally prepared."""
Field hockey bows,
to Lock Haven 3-0,Peter Ho/The Bucknellian PatriciaWay '94 dribbles away from a Delaware opponent during the Lady Bison's scoreless tie with the 18th-ranked Blue Hens.
Women's soccer drops two,"By Julie McCausland and Scooter Van Kirk Staff Writers The Bucknell field hockey team lost to Lock Haven yesterday 3- 0, as the Lady Bison continue their up-and-down season. The defeat to the Lady Eagles drops Bucknell's record for the season to 4- 10-1. Lock Haven dominated the action, out-shooting the Lady Bison 27-14 on the afternoon. Bucknell goalkeeper Danielle Ward '93 posted 13 saves against the 1989 Division III National Champions. The Lady Bison played well October 20 against Delaware, the #18 ranked team in the nation, holding the Blue Hens to a double overtime 0-0 tie. Three days earlier, Bucknell defeated Towson St 2-1 in a hard-fought battle in poor field conditions. Bucknell's superior defense was anchored by Ward, who was awarded Patriot League Player of the Week for her efforts. Last week's torrential rain postponed the team's game against Drexel. The victory against Tow- son was a ""sloppy"" win according to Coach Jen Averill. ""It's a W[in] in my book,"" said Averill. ""I'm content, but I know we can put out a much better effort than that."" The Lady Bison were leading 1-0 at the end of the first half on a goal by co-captain Jeanette Aurand '92. The score was assisted by midfielder Dana Bruce '92. Com ing out strong after intermission, Bucknell scored three minutes into the second half to go up 2-0. Defenseman Katrina Mueller '93 was assisted by Aurand for the tally. Coach Averill gave acco lades to Aurand, who came back after an early injury to play the sec ond half, when she assessed, ""This victory was in large part due to Jeanette's heads-up play."" The Tigers quickly retaliated and scored on a goal by Lisa Gray, assisted by Sue Bloomstead, shortly after Bucknell's second goal, to Finish the scoring. Towson hounded Ward who picked up 17 saves, with 21 shots on goal. Though Bucknell's offense was sparse (8 shots), it came up with the conversions to put the team ahead. Bucknell was to play Drexel last Saturday but the game was postponed to next Monday. The Dragons (5-8-1) are still hungry for a win against Bucknell, who defeated them last year. The game is scheduled for 3:30 at Bucknell West. After their 2-1 win over Towson the Lady Bison hosted East Coast Conference powerhouse Delaware (7-5-3). Playing its sec ond NCAA top-twenty team in three games, Bucknell distinguished itself with strong play and excellent defense. In the past Bucknell and Del aware have matched-up well, and Saturday was no exception. Averill commented, ""Delaware played an excellent game which forced our players to raise their level of intensity."" The teams battled to a 0-0 tie after two ten-minute overtimes, giv ing Delaware its third tie of the sea son and Bucknell, its first. Ward was shelled with thirty- five shots on goal and twenty-two defensive comers. With an incredi ble performance, Ward tallied a career-high 22 saves, and she also earned a .975 save percentage for the week (39 saves) giving her a total save percentage of .889. Ward is within .01 of the Patriot League's top goalie, and has a 1.71 GAA posting 193 saves this season and recording two shutouts. After facing Drexel on Mon day, Bucknell is off to play Ursinus (7-8-2) October 30 in Philadelphia. It has been confirmed that Alison Arth '93 will not be playing for the remainder of the season. Arth injured her ankle during prac tice, and Almira Baldwin '94 is out for the remainder of the season as well after an ankle injury sustained during practice."

"Volleyball hosts Lehigh, Lafayette tomorrow","Peter Ho/The Bucknellian Kathleen Sullivan *92 and Kara Forosisky '92 stretch for a block against Cornell. The Big Red crushed Bucknell 15-4,15-5,15-6 to drop the Lady Bison's record to 3-14 for the season. By Todd Bianchine Staff Writer The volleyball team went into Parents' Weekend with an overall record of 2-10, (0-2 in the Patriot League), and was in the middle of a seven-game losing streak. With the meat of their schedule coming up including some key conference match-ups, the Lady Bison would have no time for rest if they were to make their move. Bucknell had seven games altogether, including rival Patriot League foes Holy Cross and Fordham. Bucknell started with LaSalle on October 13, desperately trying to snap the losing tailspin, and for a while it seemed like the Lady Bison were going to do it. Despite the Explorers jumping out to the early lead by taking the first game 15 Bucknell came storming back capture the next two games 15-8, 15-10. Bucknell was on the verge of taking the fourth game and the match from LaSalle when every thing fell apart for the Lady Bison. -7, to >>They ended up losing the fourth game 15-13 and the final game 15-2 despite the strong efforts of their co-captains Kris Colbert '91 and Kara Forosisky '92, who had 10 and 14 kills, respectively. Bucknell's luck changed for the better against SL Francis. Hav ing already defeated St. Francis ear lier in the year, Bucknell's confi dence was evident in its performance on the court. Aggressive play was demon strated when setter Dee Scinta '92 quick-setted Colbert for several smashes at the net. When Scinta wasn't setting Colbert, she was dishing up assists to Meg Kinney '92, who put down 10 kills for the match. Bucknell took the match in commanding fashion 15-4, 15-13, 15-10. ""Coming in to the weekend we knew we could play with St. Francis because we had beaten them before,"" said Coach Opalski. ""But it was disappointing to lose the LaSalle match after having played them so close."" After putting the losing streak behind them, the Lady Bison set out to tangle with their Patriot League foes, Holy Cross and Fordham. Like so many of Bucknell's matches this year, they played each team close but wound up on the short end of the scoreboard. Holy Cross wasted little time after losing the first game 16-14 by taking the next three 15-3,15-12,15-8. The Lady Bison took Ford ham to the maximum five games before losing, 15-5, 9-15, 15-6, 13- 15, 15-10. Mary Jordan '93 played well, combining for 19 kills and 4 service aces. ""Holy Cross and Fordham are along the caliber of St. Francis,"" said Opalski. ""We definitely could have won, but we tried to do too much to quick and consequently we lost."" While trying to recover from the two league losses, Bucknell traveled to Gettysburg last Monday to play matches against the host and Susquehanna University. The smaller schools were up to the chal lenge, as Gettysburg eased through the match with a three-game win 15-5,15-8,15-10, and Susquehanna was victorious in five games 15-5, 15-5,12-15,7-15,15-12. Colbert led all Bucknell hit ters with twenty kills in the two matches and Sara Mesaros '93 per formed tremendously from the serv ing line with five aces. ""We just did not play well at all against Gettysburg and Susque hanna,"" commented Opalski. ""These are two teams we definitely should have beat."" ""Right now the key to us doing well is to eliminate the unforced errors,"" continued Opal ski, ""because that is what kills us. We have to stop looking at our record and constantly assessing what we have done so far; instead we have to set goals for ourselves. They don't have to be big goals, just little ones, like right now we are looking for our first conference victory, and after that we will look to the Patriot League Championships."" The Lady Bison will have a chance to reach their first goal tomorrow when they take on the Lady Leopards from Lafayette at 11 a.m,, and then will also face Lehigh in Davis Gym at 1 p.m."

Water polo sweeps MAC tourney,
Polo squad hosts alumni game tomorrow at,
7 7 a.,
m.,"By Scott Polling Staff Writer Led by interim coach Jim Harvey '88, Bucknell's water polo team stormed to victory two week ends ago at the Mid-Atlantic Con ference Tournament held at M.I.T. in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Coach Harvey was put in charge when Head Coach Lynn Kachma- rick left for the week to play with the United Slates Women's National Water Polo squad in Budapest, Hungary The #1 seeded Bison first played #8 seed Villanova. Led by great defense, Bucknell jumped out to an 8-2 halftime bulge. Harvey gave his younger and less experi enced players abundant playing time in the second half, as Bucknell breezed to a 15-9 victory. Danny Brown '93 and Tim Smaldonc GR led a balanced Bison attack of which eight players scored. Brown and Smaldone registered three goals apiece. Bucknell next played Army. Captain John Zciglcr '91 had been injured in the previous game, so Harvey replaced him with seasoned veteran Mead Briggs '91. Briggs rose to the occasion by leading all scorers with four goals and an assist Not only were the Bison without Zeigler, but another one of their top players, Kevin Shroth '92, got into early foul trouble. A J. Zot- tola '92 stepped in and played a key role in the 10-7 Bucknell vic tory over the Cadets. John Brad bury '92 turned in a tremendous performance in goal, recording nine saves. Bucknell then advanced to the championship game against familiar foe Princeton. It was just three weekends ago when the Bison took the Tigers to sudden death before winning 9-8. The team knew they would have to play a great game to win. Going into the game, Harvey instructed his players ""to stay focused and play intense."" Once again, Bucknell played great defense and surged to a 5-1 half time lead. The relentless Bison defense tired Princeton quickly as the Bison counter-attack scored most of the first half goals. Late in the third quarter, Brown got into foul trouble. Zoltola once again came in and played a key role. Zouola put away a crucial goal at the end of the third period to put Bucknell up 6-3. The Bison played a strong fourth period and won the game 10- 7 to capture the championship. Shroth led Bucknell with three goals and an assist Brown netted a goal and three assists. while Smaldone and Walter Kelly '92 registered two goals and two assists apiece. Bradbury played another outstanding game in goal, yielding only seven goals and net ting 15 saves. Harvey stressed, ""The key to our success this weekend was defense."" Finishing first in the tour nament, Bucknell upped its overall record to 11-7. Over Fall Break, the polo squad traveled to Villanova, to play four MAC games. The Bison faced Army, Navy, Iona, and Fordham. Bucknell played Army Octo ber 20 and came out a liule slow, struggling to a 5-3 halftime deficit. Kachmarick motivated her team to perform bcuer in the second half. The Bison responded by outscoring Army 7-2 in the final two periods to complete an impressive come- from-bchind win 10-7. Shroth led Bucknell with three goals and four assists. Relum ing from a brief injury hiatus, Zei- glcr scored three goals. Bradbury turned away ten shots, while yield ing only seven goals. The Bison next played a strong Navy squad. The Cadets jumped on Bucknell early and rushed out to a 3-2 lead after the opening period. But the Bison refused to give in. Bucknell thrashed Navy in the second and third periods, outscoring them 6-2."

248-3540,"Kelly led the Bison with five goals and an assist. Shroth added two goals and two assists. They cruised to a deceivingly close triumph 11- 9. Since giving top-ranked Cal- Berkley a tough match several weeks ago, the Bison had gone 11- 1. Bucknell's third game of the day was against arch-rival Iona. Both teams played a tough and even first half. The score was dead locked at 5-5 after two periods. The Bison played a valiant second half, but ended up bowing to Iona 10-7. Shroth led the team with three goals and an assist. Coming off a tough defeat, Bucknell next played Fordham on Sunday morning. The Bison wasted no time venting their frus trations, crushing Fordham 13-5. Zeigler led the onslaught by scoring two goals and four assists. Shroth added three goals and three assist, and Kelly registered four goals and an assist. Bradbury gave up goal duties for the game to Smaldone. He responded by allow ing only five goals. This weekend, the polo squad will be treated to a home match against a strong alumni team returning for homecoming. There should be a standing-room-only crowd cheering on both squads. The game starts at 11 a.m. on Saturday. Coach Kachmarick will lead her team to the MAC champion ships at Princeton next weekend. If the past several weekends are an accurate indication of the Bison's potential, the polo team should be expected to surge toward the title."

Men's soccer,"From page 20 Laura Landsiedel/The Bucknellian Tri-captain Terry Pelino '91 uses his head to elude this Fordham defender. The Bison won this game 2-1 and earned the right to host the first Patriot League Championships November 3-4. ules to go in regulation, Mackenzie had an open net in front of the Fordham goal, but was taken out of the play by a Ram player. The result was a Bucknell penalty kick to be taken by the Bison's leading scorer, Gulick. The senior slipped on his approach to the ball, but still managed to beat Fordham's Dan Callahan to the left comer, account ing for his ninth goal of the season and a Bucknell 2-1 victory. With the win, and a same day victory by Lehigh over Lafayette, Bucknell clinched a playoff spot in the Patriot League Championships and wound up as the #1 seed. Col gate is also guaranteed a berth, and the remaining two seeds will be determined by the play of Fordham, Lafayette, and Lehigh tomorrow. Bucknell, now 10-3-1 overall and 4-1-1 in the Patriot League, will also host the league tourna ment on November 3-4. The Bison have three games remaining: a make up contest at Delaware, and then matches with Buffalo and Penn State next week as a tune-up for the big tournament weekend. Goaltenders Racek and Wri- gley have combined to give up only thirteen scores in fourteen games, as each are among the league lead ers in both save percentage and goals against average. Racek and Wrigley could very well be the key when the con ference championships are held. If the two can maintain the concentra tion levels and performances that they've had all season, the Bison should be in good shape, as they make a run for their first Patriot League title.

Football,"From page 20 out the clock at the end o f the game, though. In fact, it could not even hold on to the ball. On the third play, after a Princeton timeout, Hatajik was flushed from the pocket and he threw an interception, which was returned ten yards to the Bucknell 14-yard line. Maranzana said on his deci sion to throw the ball with time running down in the game, ""If I had to do it again I wouldn't have thrown it. We have thrown out of the endzone and have safe possibili ties from there. These plays have made the difference on third downs in the past. If I had it again I would have ran the ball and punted."" On the next play, Princeton scored a touchdown, even though the pass deflected off a Bucknell defender's hands. The touchdown made the score 14-9 with 1:21 left to play. Princeton went for the two- point conversion but came up empty. The only option the Tigers had left was to try an onside kick but Bucknell was ready with ten men lined up near midfield. The strategy worked well as Jay Butler '91 recovered the kick, allowing the Bison to run out the clock. Tomorrow the Bison will play another strong I-AA team, Colgate, in the 68th Homecoming game for Bucknell. Colgate also enters the game with a 5-2 record. If Bucknell is to be effective they will have to stop the the Red Raider's potent offense. They are led by Dave Good win, who threw for 410 yards last week in a 31-7 win over Fordham. Colgate also features two strong running backs and a strong set of three receivers. This game marks the first of four Patriot League contests for both teams. Both teams are cur rently 1-0 in the league, as every game for the remainder of the sea son will ultimately determine the inaugural Patriot League champion."

Confident in their ability, the women entered the Patriot League championships at Lehigh on October 13-14. The Lady Bison fin ished third defeating Army and Lafayette but were nudged out by Lehigh and champion Fordham. In the first round, the team had a difficult time with Mary Ann Benack, Steph Ryer and Liz Mur phy falling to Fordham's top seeds. First-seed Karen Stagliano and sec ond-seed Kymm Carlson both had byes. The only Bucknell win came from Jennifer Wyckoff '92 who defeated her Holy Cross opponent with ease 6-1, 6-2. The only Buck- ncll first-round doubles match was captured by the team of Stagliano- Benack versus Army 6-0,6-1.

Stagliano defeated her Fordham opponent in a third singles match and the team of Carl son/ Thompson beat out Army in the second doubles match.

The Bison men's team defeated the University of Ala bama, the eleventh-ranked team in the nation, while finishing behind only four other teams, three of which are also ranked in the nation's top twenty. Bucknell looks to extend its good fortunes tomorrow, as they try to capture the inaugural Patriot League Championships. Deardorff placed fifteenth in the overall standings, and credited Bucknell's remarkable effort to a good training schedule. 'Things are starting to come together for us now,"" said Dear- dorff. 'The training gets a little dif ferent now, the workouts are quicker than they were in the beginning of the season, so our legs aren't quite as dead for racing. And we ran pretty tough, according to the coach."" After this excellent meet, the Bucknell men will go on to race in the Patriot League Championships, a race that could be difficult. "" It depends on who's there,"" notes Deardorff. "" Army is pretty good, but besides Army, there aren't any really strong teams."" Other finishers for Bucknell at pre-NCAA's were Bob Kelly '92, Todd Vincent '92, Je ff Loomis '92, Matt Loeffier '92, Norbert Bcrenyi '91, and Jason Cahilly '92, who placed 27th, 34th, 37th, 44th, 45th, and 50th, respectively. The women's cross-country team did not race in the past two weeks. The Lady Bison will also run at the Patriot League Champion- <o"

Mackenzie powers men's soccer to 2-0 win,
Bison top Delaware to raise record to 11-3-1,"By Chad Bown Staff Writer In a similar manner that many great football teams have two strong and competent quarterbacks, the Bucknell men's soccer team has been led all season by the strong play of its two field gener als, goaltenders Scott Racek '91 and Mark Wrigley '94. The platoon system instituted by Coach Craig Reynolds has been a major reason why the Bison now find themselves Colin Bridgewater/The Bucknellian Tri-captain Kirk Lorie '91 is a large reason why the Bison defense has been so difficult to score upon this season. in first place in the Patriot League. Bucknell's record currently stands at 10-3-1. Bucknell traveled to Easton on October 13 for a key game against rival Lafayette. The field conditions were poor, but the play was evenly matched throughout the contest. The Bison had their best opportunity to score in the first half, but Lafayette goalie Peter Lugar made an outstanding save on a Ken Gulick '91 one-timer. Buck nell keeper Scott Racek '91 also played a solid first half for the Bison, keeping the game close. The second half looked bleak for Buck nell when Lafayette's Timo Pape stuck in a rebound against goalie Mark Wrigley '94 just ten minutes into the second half, putting the Bison in a 1-0 hole. Bucknell came back though, and at 24:20 reserve Jeff Capone '94 lifted the Bison with his first goal of the season to tie the score. At the end of regulation, the score remained 1-1, and the two teams played a scoreless overtime period to end the contest in a deadlock. ""I was real pleased with our performance,"" said Coach Reynolds. ""I used the bench a lot more than I have in previous games, and the intensity of the starters and reserves was real good. Capone, Bill Connors '93, and Bo Fifer '94 performed well filling in to give our starters a well needed rest. It would have been sweet to win it, but it's better than a disap pointing loss."" The team then traveled Octo ber 17 to play a struggling Ship- pensburg squad. Both teams played Goalie Scott Racek '91, seen here against Army, teamed up with Mark Hens yesterday at Delaware. a sluggish first half. Bucknell had its share of scoring opportunities, as Bison shots hit the post twice, and on another missed opportunity, Bucknell missed a wide-open net. The Bison continued to strug gle until Keith Goodling '92 took a Terry Pelino '91 pass at 27:00 and knocked it into the net for a 1-0 Bison lead. Unfortunately, the Bucknell defense had a letdown and allowed Shippensburg's Doug Puchalla to sneak a goal past Racek to tie the score with just under seven minutes to go in the first half. The score remained tied at the half, and Reynolds found himself need ing to tell his squad to get more fired up for the second half. Whatever the words were that Reynolds used, they were more"
Football win streak halted at five,"By Scott Brown Staff Writer Bucknell football's five- game win streak was snapped last Saturday when the Bison allowed a 10-0 first quarter lead to slip away, as William & Mary scored 45 straight points in their 45-17 vic tory. The Tribe, ranked 14th in Division I-AA, had too strong of an offense for Bucknell, gaining 562 yards on the day and averag ing over seven yards for each play. The game started out well for the Bison, as they took opening kickoff and drove yards before Todd Krutchkoff nailed a 41 yard field goal drive was sparked by a 26-yard scamper up the middle by Brian Henesey '92. The run put him in fifth place on Bucknell's all-time rushing list. After William & Mary missed a field goal, Bucknell got the ball back on its own 22-yard line. The Bison marched to the Tribe goalline in ten plays, culmi nating with a 19-yard touchdown pass from Todd Hatajik '91 to Lester Erb '91 with two minutes left to play in the opening quarter."

The drive was highlighted by two more completions from Hatajik to Erb, an 18-yarder and a 22-yarder. At this point, the Bison looked as if they were rolling to their sixth win, but on William & Mary's next play from scrimmage Chris Hakel completed an 80-yard pass to Mark Compher to bring the score to 10-7. That touchdown turned the tide considerably and from that point on it was all William & Mary. On its next possession fol lowing a Bucknell punt, the Tribe drove 73 yards in just under five minutes to jump ahead 14-10 a lead it wouldn't relinquish. The drive was dominated by the Wil liam & Mary backfield, Tyrone Shelton and Robert Green, who accounted for 64 of the 73 yards on the drive. William & Mary got the ball back later in the quarter after Hata jik was intercepted. After a clip ping call on the return, the Tribe took over on Bucknell's 35 and scored four plays later as Hakel again connected with Compher for third quarter, the score, this time from 22 yards.

The Bison look advantage of the Shippensburg defense with seven unanswered goals to propel them to the 8-1 vic tory. Alex Kogan '94 had a hat trick and Gulick, Jon Mackenzie '93, Ryan Bucceri '94, and Scott Tardibuono '93 each added single scores. ""The second half took a little of the air out of their balloon,"" stated Reynolds. ""It was good to have a second half where we weren't shaky. I'm glad that some of the reserves were able to come in and maintain and even add to our lead."" Bucknell hosted the Fordham Rams last Saturday in another cru cial Patriot League contest Reynolds had said earlier in the season that ""Fordham had the best personnel of anyone in the league, and if they played their best ball game, they'd be tough to beat."" The game was tightly played in the first half until some miscom- Colin Brldgewater/The Bucknellian Wrigley '94 to shutout the Blue munication between the Bison defense gave Fordham their first goal and a 1-0 lead. Racek found himself out of the net, and the Rams' Seamus Lynch found the goal just 18:05 into the period to put the Bison behind. ""I was worried that that turno ver was going to be the difference in the ball game,"" stated Reynolds. ""We didn't make them earn their goal, so to make it close, the key would be getting one back before halftime."" Bucknell kept the pressure on finally lit up the scoreboard when Gulick hit a bouncing ball to Dan D'Angelo '92, who struck one past Fordham's keeper to knot the score at one.

Three points was a low possibility."" The third quarter continued with more great Bucknell defense. After recovering a Cavlovic fumble, the Tigers drove 44 yards down to the Bucknell five- yard line, includ ing a 27-yard run by Erick Hamilton on the drive's opening play. Bucknell then held its ground. They stopped the Tigers on three straight plays and forced Princeton to attempt a fourth 1 Ashley Chertkof/The Bucknellian down play from the one yard line.

He completed all five of the passes he threw for 56 yards, including an 11-yard touch down pass to Jeff Wall '92. The extra point made the final score 45- 17. Krutchkoffs kick, his 25th straight, ties the single season record set by Steve Barimo in 1988. The previous week Bucknell defeated Princeton 14-9, in a game led by the defense. The main spark was provided by John Spatafore '92, who was named the Patriot League Defensive Player of the Week. He was credited with 19 tackles, including 12 unassisted and a sack. He also intercepted his sec ond pass of the year and returned it 32 yards to set up the Bison's sec ond touchdown.

On the next play, Hatajik connected with Walsh for 16 yards. A few plays later Hatajik kept the ball and ran seventeen yards down the right sideline before going out of bounds at the three. Three plays later Cav lovic punched the ball in from the one yard line to give the Bison a 7- 0 lead. Bucknell had one more crack at scoring, as they began another drive with 4:23 left on the clock. Hatajik completed a 14-yard pare to Marc Harrison '91 following a 20-yard strike to Erb. But Hatajik was intercepted, as he attempted to convert a fourth down from Prince ton's 27-yard line with :25 left in the half. Coach Lou Maranzana com mented on his decision to go for the first down in lieu of the 44-yard field goal. ""First, given the condi tions, it was a real tough field goal. We figured it was on the outer lim its of Todd's range. We thought we right, but was una ble to score as he was stopped by Kevin Kane '93. Kane ended the game with 13 tackles. Bucknell's offense got into the act after it received a spark from the defense. Spatafore picked off a Joel Sharp pass and returned it to Princeton's 28-yard line. Three plays later, on third-and-eight, Hat ajik threw to Erb as the wide receiver broke past the comerback on a slant pattern over the middle of the field. The play totalled 26 yards and put the Bison up by four teen points. Princeton took the kickoff and drove 60 yards on 10 plays cul minating with a 30-yard field goal by Chris Lutz. The key play on the drive was a 19-yard run up the mid dle by Chris Hallihan. For the game, Hallihan had 113 yards on 16 carries. Princeton ran for a total of 190 yards against the Bison.

Administration reacts,"By David M urray Staff Writer Reflecting back upon Wednesday night's near-riot on 7th Street, President Gary Sojka and Dean of Students John Dunlop both agree that students were lucky in the way the disturbance was han dled by police. They also appre ciate students' sincerety and com mitment to productive change, and hope many constructive sugges tions will flow from Wednesday's unrest. ""Students never knew they were in jeopardy,"" commented Dunlop. 'They never knew the potential"" for danger. ""The thing I'm still most grateful for,"" added Sojka, ""is that...nobody got whacked on the head with a club, nobody got attacked by a dog, nobody got blasted with a water cannon, nobody got arrested, no policeman ended up in the emer gency room with cuts and abra sions, and there was no significant property damage."" Thinking back to the stand off with police, Sojka said ""I was certainly impressed with a number of what I would call 'Student Lead ers' and I don't mean necessarily people holding elected posts in stu dent government, but people who took it upon themselves to rise to the front in a tense situation to put themselves in, if not in physical jeopardy, in jeopardy of ridicule from their colleagues, and they were willing to take that chance to do what they thought was the right thing. There were a fair number of such people, and that's gratifying."" Dunlop assessed student opinion after the demonstration: ""Everyone feels good today because they finally, from their point of view, had a say... They thought for once their administra tion listened long and hard and I think we [in the administration] feel good too because we really tried"" to address student concerns. Looking ahead, however, the President warned that ""a very criti cal period lies ahead of us this weekend. Obviously,"" Sojka said, ""security is still going to be here. We still have Act 31. We still have obligations to do due diligence in enforcing Act 31."" Sojka continued ""Hopefully the students will note that security is trying to be very sensitive in the discharging of their duties. We urge the students to be extremely respon sible in controlling their own activi ties, as they often say they want to do. They want to demonstrate their ability to show their maturity and their ability to socialize in a respon sible fashion. This weekend is a marvelous opportunity for students to demonstrate that."" By Bob Ritter Staff Writer The 200 block of South Sev enth Street was the scene of a near riot by approximately 900 to 1000 Bucknell students late Wednesday night and early Thursday morning. According to Lewisburg police and John Dunlop, dean of students, only one student was detained, but he was later released. At press time ""no charges had been filed. The crowd was eventually cleared, as students moved onto campus (See related stories). The incident began around 10:30 on Wednesday night, when members of the Lewisburg Police Department responded to a call from Union County dispatch; a res ident of S t Catherine Street had reported a loud party in progress at the rear of 208 South 7th Street, with about 200-300 students. Two officers responded to the call, one of whom was Lt. Leo Yount. He explained that ""One officer came from the alley, and I came from the intersection. There were four houses, just full of students. No mistake, it was loaded. ...There was no question, it was definitely a situation which had to be dis persed. For whatever reason, a selected few stuck around."" Yount said that when he arrived one student identified him self as one of the residents, gave Yount his student identification, and explained that the party had gotten out of their control. After the officers told the crowd to dis perse another student, Scott Macfec '92, asked if he could take Yount's photograph. According to Yount, ""I told him to disperse, and he stuck around. I told him again to dis perse, and he took the picture and ran."" Yount caught Macfee, who was detained in a police car and later released. Macfee said, ""I took his pic ture and he chased me. He threw me against a wall, [then threw me in the back of a car for 45 min utes."" Macfee quoted Yount as say ing, ""Why did you take my picture, I told you not to,"" when he was detained. Yount explained that snapping the photo was not against the law, but ""the situation was I told him to disperse. Everyone wants to see how far he wants to go, and at that point I was commit ted to stop him."" Yount said that the crowd, which was dispersing, began to return to the backyard to watch Macfee. Macfee claimed Wednesday night that Yount had used excessive force, and that he planned to press charges. In a fur ther interview Thursday, Macfee said, ""I saw I had no place to run, so I turned to face him [Yount], He put me up against the wall and shook me"" with his hands around Macfee's neck. He said that, according to three witnesses, ""It looked prety excessive, since he was shaking me. I don't know why he grabbed me around the neck, since it left my arms free."" Yount would not comment on Macfee's accusations, other than to say that the description ""was entirely his own opinion."" According to several other students present, the treatment and detention of Macfee sparked the demonstration by encouraging stu dents to remain until Macfee was released. Garrett Austin '94 said, ""I was at the party. The cops started swarming in. (According to Lewis burg Chief Donald Heiter, only two officers responded initially.) We moved out into the street, [and] a student took a picture of a cop."" After Macfee's detention, ""We sat down in the street and started chanting 'Give Peace a Chance.' More people heard us and more people came."" When asked if he felt the incident with Macfee sparked the disturbance, Yount said, ""I disagree with that. Over 100 people had already moved out front."" Although Dunlop and Yount said that only Macfee was detained, another student, Keith Mann '93 was also detained by East Buffalo Township Police, and was also released. Chief Robert Gramley said that at least two students had been detained and that ""we detained one person for Lewis burg;"" the confusion in official accounts seems to be because Mac fee was detained by Lewisburg Police, while Mann was held by East Buffalo Township. Mann said that ""a couple peo- See NEAR R IO T, page 4"
Students vent frustrations uphill,
Jimmy Carter speaks,
at Weis Center,"By Andrew Cohen Staff Writer 'T his is a very good time for me emotionally, I've been very busy,"" said former President James Earl Carter. Carter spoke at a pri vate party for the Geisinger Foun dation which honored former Penn sylvania Governor William Scranton and former Pennsylvania health services director Leonard Bachman Wednesday night at the Weis Center. The Geisinger Foun dation rented out the Weis Center for this private function. Carter appreciated the fact that there were no reporters there becuase while in office he ""was fol lowed around by 1200 ... inquisitive reporters in the White House press room."" Carter discussed humanitar ian concerns in medicine as well as the crisis in the Persian Gulf. In addressing the many physi cians at the dinner Carter stressed the importance of the ""prevention of disease, [since] 65%  of all of the premature deaths can be prevented by our own personal habits."" He explained that ""when we organized that Carter Center in Atlanta Geor gia I chose as director, Dr. William Fahey [the man who eradicated smallpox]."" He described the humanitar ian purpose of the Carter Center and related one of its projects to the audience. ""We were asked to come to China in 1987 ... We were asked to add an unprecedented element to the life of the Chinese, care for the handicapped."" He told the audi ence that Deng Xao Ping's son had fallen from a third story window, and that the Chinese infrastructure was not equipped to accomodate handicapped people. The Carter Center therefore ""trained 93 spe cialists to work with [the Chinese] people"" and to train other specialists. In discussing the world situa tion, Carter presented both general and specific views. On the general level Carter explained that there is a ""university in Switzerland moni toring major world conflicts. [But] not a single one of them was between two countries. Every one of them was a civil war."" He explained that world protocol pre cludes ""the U J9. ... from dealing with this."" It is this ""horrible vac- cum in the world that the Carter Center is trying to address,"" said Carter. Carter eased in to the Gulf Crisis by explaining that during his ""administration the greatest threat of World War III was in Europe, [but] now the Middle East may be."" He espoused three general guidelines that the U.S. should use See C A R TER, page 2 By David M urray Staff Writer After the students involved in Wednesday night's near-riot left 7th Street, they moved to the down hill side of the Langone Center. A portable microphone amplification system was set up, and President Gary Sojka, along with other administrators, addressed the crowd. Sojka began by discussing student concerns about the depart ment of security and safety. ""There has been a change in stance and in personnel,"" said Sojka, ""and I thought part of that was, in effect, because students were saying 'it's too oppressive; some of these things are wrong; our rights are being violated' and we have told security 'be sensitive. Examine what you're doing.'"" Sojka continued ""It's a whole question of enforcement. It's a very difficult area. You've got security officers who know what the law is and what they're supposed to do. You've got students saying 'If you do that it makes it unbearable and we're paying customers and you're driving us away.' You've got me leaning on [security] saying 'folks, we've got to be somewhat sensitive to the students. They're trying to find their way, and they are not per fect people.' ""I'm telling you, I thought we were a little too over-zealous ear lier in the year, not because we weren't doing the law right; the law is very clear. Our problem was that we may have been a little over- zealous trying to catch people rather than use due diligence and make sure that we were doing a reasonable job of discouraging underage drinking on campus. We must continue to do that. ""Whether or not we could be thoroughly and perfectly consistent is tough because the events are not identical, the situations aren't iden tical, the mood of the officers and the mood of the students isn't iden tical; we are trying to hear you, and we are trying to create a situation where you're going to be [uphill] and not [in town] as much as possi ble. But some people down there were saying 'well why don't you get the kegs going up here and let's open it up and have a great time' and the answer is that that is not to be and that won't be."" By approximately 1:30 a.m., the majority of students had left the downhill LC and were gathering on the academic quad outside the main library entrance. Sojka, Vince DeCerchio, director of security and safety, John Dunlop, dean of stu dents, Charlotte Weddle, associate vice president for student life, and community anymore. The applica tion and enforcement is going to be uniform across the entire commu nity. It's going to apply to faculty, it's going to apply to staff, it's going to apply to residence hails, and it's going to apply to fraternities."" DeCerchio concluded, ""I think if you're part of the process, and if communication's open, and if I communicate with you openly and honestly, 1 think you'll see that things will improve considerably."" Sojka was then questioned about what the University can do to relax the pressures applied by Penn sylvania Act 31. ""You want to know what the University has been doing about Act 31?"" the President See FRU STRA TIO N S, page 5 Colin Brldgewater/The Bucknellian Discussion began at the Langone center with President Sojka and John Dunlop, dean of students after the crowd left Seventh Street. Concerns were voiced in an open forum format. Gerry Commerford, assistant dean of residential life, all walked from the LC to the gathering on the quad. Once the portable amplifica tion system was set up again next to the library door, the administra tors resumed their dialogue with students. DeCerchio began by answer ing questions about his own depart ment ""I know that the system has been flawed in some ways. I know that communications have broken down between our department and the students, and I think it's impor tant that we re-establish communi cations and that the students have a direct line in the policy making pro cedure"" DeCerchio said. When asked a specific ques tion about the Greek community, DeCerchio responded ""I don't think we're going to single out the Greek"

[Iraq has been] a landlocked country"" although they have a historical claim to access to the Persian Gulf. ""Another problem was that the Ira qis claim ... they protected ... Kuwait from an Iranian invasion."" Kuwait also loaned $12 billion to Iraq during the war and demanded repayment afterwards. The ""Iraqis claim that the Kuwaitis drilled into Iraq during the war."" The Iraqis claim that Kuwait ""exceeded the OPEC quoted by a million barrels a day."" The signs were obvious but the rest of the world avoided them, according to Carter. ""They tried to negotiate to resolve these prob lems. Saddam said he was going to invade Kuwait and nobody believed him."" After the invasion, according to Carter, the ""U.S. and all the other countries in the Western World rose up in anger and demanded total withdrawal."" Carter agrees with sanctions to an extent. ""The most effective thing to do is punish [them with sanctions]. We have to cut off sup plies of crucial materials to Iraq. I don't know of any alternative to these economic sanctions."" But, Carter disagrees with the total embargo against Iraq. He charac-"

K,"terized it as ""trying to force a dicta tor out of office by [crushing] his people."" According to Carter, Huss ein was not ""going without his Cornflakes."" ""The other option is military action,"" according to Carter. ""This is increasingly being urged over others ... [including] President Bush."" Carter offered several rea sons not to go to war. The Carter Center calls ""twelve experts to analyze the inva sion of Iraq,"" and among them was Admiral William Crowe, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. According to Carter, ""He [Crowe] pointed out that there is a trusim in military strategy. [It takes] three times the force to invade than to invade .... that makes it extraordinarily difficult [difficult] for an invading force to overcome you're entrenched [position]."" Carter cited this truism as the rea son that Iraq did not defeat Iran because both countries kept going into the other. Carter also explained that Moslems ""take over the role of a martyr"" to defend their country against ""Western infidels."" Economically, Carter warned that the Iraqis are ""capable of carry ing out Saddam Hussein's threat [to destroy oil rigs in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia using sophisticated artillery]."" In terms of the human cost, Carter estimated that war with Iraq would cost 10,000 to 30,000 Amer ican lives ""and that does not include women and children in Kuwait City."" Carter finally described the international problems that would arise if the U.S. went to war with out the U.N. support. ""Even if we are inclined to go to war with Iraq, if we were to do so without the sup port of the U.N. Security Council it would be very bad politicallly.

DeCerchio addresses Panhel,"By Brian Hutchinson Only hours before 900 stu dents and 200 police officers con fronted one another on seventh street, Vincent DeCerchio, Buck- nell's new security director, met with the Panhellenic Council. Hosted by Dean Dunlop, the pur pose of this meeting was to address specific security issues and to dis cuss DeCerchio's intentions con cerning the more pressing problems of the current system. DeCerchio is a strong advo cate of students themselves becom ing a Vital ingredient in implement ing the new policy-development process. DeCerchio began, ""I believe in students rights. I am a strong believer in participatory management."" Under his director ship, students would accept his challenge by taking full advantage of his ""open door policy"". ""This team-approach is the single most important contribution to good rela tions--its absence being the single most deficit to bad relations."" Evi dently to DeCerchio, the lack of such an approach has been most instrumental in fostering the current student sentiment toward the nature of Bucknell Security's behavior. DeCerchio addressed this pre vailing sentiment which he feels is embodied by the recently submitted petition which now has over 1000 student signatures. ""The petition discussed seven or eight conditions. point-by-point, professionally and objectively, and its points are well taken."" DeCerchio promises that he will begin his prompt response through policy implementation that will include the following: an accu rate reporting of student violations, the insurance that reports will be made promptly available to the par ties involved, and a clear definition of security procedures. A member raised the question of whether or not a charge brought against a student and its proceed ings should be accompanied by a time limit. Another member expressed the importance of pre venting charges of students from being ""left over"" for weeks at a time--something which, in the recent past, had occurred much to the utter frustration of those people involved. DeCerchio responded, ""We are thinking along the lines of a charge sheet listing all common violations--a check-off list with an attached charge sheet"" With his plan, a statute of limitation would also be enacted. This limitation would cause the nullification of all charges that fail to be filed within an established time period. When asked how the security officers had thus far reacted to the forthcoming changes, DeCerchio explained, ""They've reacted posi tively. In the past, they have often been acting on their own without specific guidelines."" Students have been well aware of the scope of the latitude with which security had recently been armored and have been subject to the inconsistent approaches among security offi cials. The measure of strictness or ""leniency"" with which incidents were handled did in no way reflect a security officer's feelings toward students. According to DeCerchio, ""I do not want someone working for me that does not like the stu dents. The new director is eagerly awaiting the day when students again can feel comfortable with those campus employees whose jobs are to protect the very same people with whom there is a grow ing animosity. Evidently, students have been growing increasingly impatient awaiting this day. DeCerchio empathizes with the University's position facing state laws and their inherent liabili ties. His intention is to develop ""a process"" that would satisfy the obli gations of the University as dic tated by these liabilities. DeCerchio does not assert that the policies this process ultimately would yield must follow the letter of the law necessarily. ""We want to satisfy the spirit of the law but in the context of University terminology, not in legal terminology."" The system under DeCerchio appears to be more sympathetic to student demands. In the pursuit of dismantling the current parent-child relationship that security has with See DECERCHIO, page 6"
Condom distribution assessed,"By Michael McGandy Staff Writer Though condoms have been available on campus at the Ziegler Health Center and through vending machines located in laun dry rooms since 1988, Morgan Woods '93 believes that most stu dents may not know that they are available at all. Responding to this perceived ignorance or disfavor of the manner in which the University makes condoms available to stu dents, Woods and a collection of students and administrators have commited themselves to gathering student input in an effort to create a scheme of distribution that will cor respond to student needs. Stating that Bucknell's mode of condom distribution was ""a little outdated since most campuses have condom machines in dormi tory bathrooms and sell them in their bookstores,"" Woods wants to explore the possibility that the Uni versity may need to revamp its present mode of distribution in order to encourage the use of con doms as an effective means of pre venting sexually transmitted diseases. According to Woods, who is working through the Umbrella Organization, early this month stu dents will receive a questionnaire requesting them to state their sug gestions for reconsidering condom availability. At present, Woods said, she is not certain how the Univer sity should make condoms more accessible and that her plan for peti tioning the administration would be determined primarily by referring to responses to the questionnaire. Assistant Director of Resi dential Life Susan Zingale, who has been working with Woods, said that at this stage the project concerning condom distribution is at an infor mation gathering stage. ""I am mostly interested in hearing what students think; it's their issue, it's their campus."" In addition to the Umbrella Organization, an organizational alli ance of activist groups on campus, - Friends of Gay men and Lesbians, and the Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual Awareness Group- are supportive of Woods' efforts to explore the possibilities of widening the availa bility of condoms on campus. In response to the danger of the spread of sexually transmit ted diseases, and particularly AIDS, the University has concerned itself with making condoms available to students for a number of years yet it appears that members of the administration were originally quite resistant to introducing condom vending machines to the campus on the grounds that it would be improper. Mark Cool '91, a member of the President's Advisory Com mittee on AIDS in 1987, stated that the committee was exceptionally slow in moving ahead on making condoms available on campus because of these concerns for pro priety. ""We sat and fought about what alumni, parents, and prospec tive students would say when they saw condom dispensers in resi dence halls,"" Cool said. The perspective of the stu dents on the committee, according to Cool, was that the concern for the opinion of alumni and others did not outweigh the need to take preventative measures against AIDS and other sexually transmit ted diseases. Cool cited former legal counsel John Zeller as the member of the committee who was most opposed to making condoms available on campus; in addition, director of the book store, Eileen Morrow, also blocked efforts to sell condoms in the book store. Morrow was unable to be contacted before this edition went to print but Vicki Benion, assistant director of the bookstore, stated that at the time the bookstore was being restricted from selling con doms by University policy, rather than actually refusing to offer them for purchase. While unable to comment on previous adminstrative attitudes Zingale said, ""We as administrators need to accept that students are having sex."" For Zingale the most important issue is to provide stu dents with a means to protect them selves from secually transmitted diseases (STD's) and AIDS. ""The national situation has gotten to the point where AIDS is pretty much everywhere and in considering con dom availability we have to think long-term and be more progressive."" At present condoms are available in laundry rooms located in four dormitories--the Gateways, Bucknell West, Swartz Hall , and Roberts Hall. A fifth machine was located in Vedder Hall, but it was damaged in spring of this year and has yet to be repaired. According to Preston Hoyle, director of student medical services, 1104 condoms were dis tributed from these machines between March 1989 and March 1990. Between August and Septem ber of this year, 232 condoms were sold. In Hoyle's estimation, consid ering that these numbers represent the distribution from four or five machines across the campus, stu dent usage is infrequent. Hoyle also commented that though brochures educating people concerning STDs and safe sexual practises are meant to be available with the condoms, they are seldom found in the racks that are attached to the vending machines. ""Con doms alone are not going to solve the AIDS problem without educa tion and people changing their sex ual behavior,"" Hoyle said. Since 1986 the University has supported a handful of commit tees that addressed the issues of AIDS and AIDS prevention. A Uni versity Committee on AIDS com posed of administrators was orga nized in 1986 to develop a procedural guideline to be in accord with the guidelines of the American College Health Associa tion concerning AIDS. Further more, there has been the AIDS Task Force composed of students and administrators and a collection of students who act as Peer Educa tors on the issue of AIDS and the transmission on the virus. Safe sex kits that contain condoms, spermicidial foam, and educational brochures have also been available through Student Health Services since 1987. But students have not had much recourse to these either; during the 1989-90 academic year sixty five kits were distributed by the Health Center and fourteen so far this year. ""I am sure that the major ity of the campus is not aware that the kits are available,"" Hoyle stated suggesting that there was a need to See CONDOMS, page 5"
University considering plans for,
retirement complex near campus,"By Tara Gilligan Staff Writer In an attempt to limit tuition cost increases, Bucknell is consid ering building a retirement village on a 26-acre tract of land between the athletic fields and the golf course. A committee headed by Russell Ernest, graduate of the class of 1942, is investigating the feasibility of opening the retire ment complex which would supply the university with non-tuition revenue. The primary reason for such an investigation, is to ""see if it's feasible 'to have a return on that , real estate asset that's greater than what we're earning on it not in renting it out to a local farmer,"" said Barry Maxwell, vice president for administration. ""We're continually con cerned with the escalating increases in tuition and one of objectives is to examine very closely all non-tuition sources of revenue with the intent of trying to hold our tuition increases to a mini mum,"" Maxwell said. The retirement village would be for alumni, retired staff, and friends of the university. ""We see particularly great benefits for hav ing retired Bucknell alumni and friends of the university in close proximity of the university to be able to work and interact with faculty and staff in productive kinds of ways,"" said Maxwell. Members of the general com munity would not be permitted into the village unless they were con nected in some way to the univer sity. ""We would not open it to the general public ... we would want it to be Bucknell related,"" said Maxwell. Ernest, project coordinator, has been conducting phone inter views of 50 retired alumni from the classes of 1936-61 who, in response to a questionnaire, expres sed interest in entering such a com munity within the next two to five years. By conducting telephone interviews, Ernest intends to find out exactly how many individuals are willing to see the project move forward. The project is still in plan ning stages. Ernest's committee will present its proposal at the Nov. 16 meeting of the board of trustees. In the meantime, the committee is considering whether enough indi viduals will be willing to put their homes up for sale in a time when the real estate market is not strong. ""I've talked to about 34 of [the alumni] and there is interest. The main concern that people have is their ability to sell their existing home and take their equity in that home and come here and pay for a unit here in retirement,"" said Ernest. Eight years ago the university conducted a similar study, also headed by Ernest. For that project, an architect drew up a plan for the retirement village before the com mittee decided to postpone further planning due to the poor real estate market. The current project has not reached the stage in which an archi tect would be consulted. A core group of about 15 retirees would be necessary for starting the project 'To insure interest we'd have to ask for a deposit,"" said Ernest. The deposit would likely be approximately $2000 to $3000. Deposits would be placed in an escrow account. ""Then when it came to build ing [the village] they would have to put up a fair amount because the first payments to build it would be due,"" said Ernest. According to Ernest, the committee would like the project to be self-financing so that no univer sity funds would be necessary in initiating construction. Money retir ees pay for units would be used to finance construction. Although the complex, when complete, would include just over 100 living units, only groups of about 15 would be built at a time. Units for the core group of 15 retir ees will, if the project continues, be complete in two to three years. Retirees who decide to move into the retirement village will have a choice of several different types of housing units. Ernest explained that the committee is considering three types of housing: apartments, clustered units, and semi-detached units. According to Ernest, the apartment house might be built to look like a bam ""to keep the archi tecture rural looking, and because it would be right next to the art bam."" In addition, he said, building it into a hill would allow easy access to different floors without forcing elderly individuals to climb stairs. Rather than town houses, which also have stairs, one-story clustered units would be an option for retirees. ""A lot of older people don't like steps, so townhouses probably wouldn't be too popular,"" said Ernest Prices for an apartment might range from $50-70,000, and, $140- 150,000 for a larger unit, according to Maxwell. However, because the project is still in the early planning stages, the committee has con ducted no sophisticated cost analyses. ""What we're trying to gauge is whether there's an interest and whether that interest is at all impacted by the range that we would price the units at,"" said Maxwell. If not enough people commit to the project, the committee will recommend to the trustees that the project be put on hold a little longer."

Near riot,"pie started sitting down and singing, [and] I was saying 'just sit down, join in, sing.'"" As he was walking around the group, Mann said, he got his arms ""pinned behind by four cops. They told me I was being arrested for instigating a riot. They cuffed me and threw me in the back of a car for an hour."" He said of Dunlop: ""I think he had a pretty big part in getting me out."" Finally, Mann said he was told that ""if I get out and try to disperse the crowd, they'd let me go, otherwise they'd keep me."" He addressed the crowd over the loudspeaker for about five minutes ""with security holding me on both sides. After it wasn't work ing, they made me leave the scene."" According to Heiter and Yount, the first call for additional help was issued approximately 20 to 30 minutes after the first call was received around 11 p.m. additional help was requested from the imme diate area. Heiter said a ""call for mutual aid for all police depart ments to respond with as many men as possible to Lewisburg Borough."" He said the call, which is analgous to a general alarm by a fire depart ment, brought units from nearly every municipality within a 20-mile radius. According to Heiter, the police compliment included mem bers from 12 to 14 departments in four counties, with a ""guesstimate of about 100."" Other press accounts have placed the number between 180 and 190. Heiter said that the contingent included five canaine units from the area, as well as two fire engines and one medical unit from the William Cameron Engine Company, and one ambulance. The fire units had hoses connected and ready to use on the students, if necessary. Heiter said the water pressure would not have been sufficient to injure peo ple, but only to ""get them wet and slipping and sliding around. It gives us a chance to snap them up."" Photo by Scott MacFee John Dunlop, dean of students, looks on as East Buffalo Police cuff and detain Keith Mann. According to Mann, Dunlop was instrumen tal in securing his release. In addition, the State Police in Milton had ""approximately 80 people available, [although] not all were on-site,"" according to Corpo ral Max Beaver of the Milton Bar racks. Some of the troopers were waiting in a staging area estab lished at the Plaza 15. He said that, according to standard procedure, all coopers were dressed in full riot gear. The United States pentientary in Lewisburg also responded with three buses and 40 staff members, including a SWAT team, according to Public Affairs Officer Donald Emery. He said that the institution ""responded at the request of Union County...at approximately 11:45 p.m., [and] did not directly partici pate"" in the detention of students. President Gary Sojka quickly arrived on the scene and began speaking to the students in an attempt to convince them to dis perse. According to Austin, ""Basi cally Sojka did a good job. He hon estly listened to us, and said 'I'm trying to change things, give me a chance."" The situation soon moved into a standoff, as more students congregated in the area, with about 100 students perched on the roofs of front porches on the block. Sojka was soon joined on the scene by Dunlop, Charlotte Weddle, asso ciate vice president for Student Life, Gerry Comerford, assistant dean of Residential Life, and Vince DeCerchio, director of Security and Safety. The administrators moved through the crowd, and a number of students, administrators and towns people addressed the crowd on a loudspeaker, encouraging the crowd to move onto campus. Bill Ockcr '57, a resident of Market Street, told the crowd, ""We had fun, too, but we knew when to quit That time is now. We don't want any damn riot around here."" Police also made an effort to usher students onto the sidewalks. Members of the East Buffalo Police Department were brandishing ""stun guns"" at students while telling them to move. One officer held the device within two inches of a stu dent and discharged the device. Gramley said that ""in order for it to stun anyone, he has to touch some one, [but] you could scare someone by clicking it a few times."" By around 11:30, Sojka had agreed to address students at the downhill entrance to the Langone Center, and Heiter said no one would be arrested if they moved up to the LC. At approximately 12:15, Dunlop summed up the situation: ""We're trying to get them up there, but they don't want to go."" Shortly after midnight, Heiter began moving his car slowly down the street, behind several officers, Comerford, Dunlop and Weddle. When the car, moving south, came abreast of 220 South Seventh, Heiter's car was hit first by an egg, and then by two bottles, causing minor damage. Heiter said today, ""All I needed was one more inci dent, and that would have been 'all she wrote.' It was just a matter of time [until the police were in place]; From page 1 everyone would have been arrested."" He said, ""If we had to move we could have done it...The idea is to get them to disperse. They didn't have respect [for us] at that particular time, and if they don't disperse, there's going to be a lot of sorry people."" He went on to say, ""Respect is a two-way street.. .They can't even police their own friends. They've got to respect the law in this community."" There were some on the scene who questioned the degree of mobilization by the police. When asked about the presence of the canaine units, Comerford said, ""I'm not in charge of the local police, but I don't think it's right"" When interviewed at 2:30 a.m., and again Thursday afternoon, Heiter vigor ously defended the level of repsonse, saying, ""It's better to have all you need, it could have been a lot worse....I think everyone did a fine job in cooperating and trying to work with [the students]."" Heiter wanted to make sure he had adequete force available to control any consequence which might arise because ""I do not want to be responsible for any fatalities from drug overdose, alcohol overdose or criminal activity."" Among the administrators on the scene, Weddle said, ""They're breaking the law. [Heiter] issued an order and the responsibility is on the students....The risk of danger and harm is so great"" DeCerchio felt ""the students have a valid point, but I believe they're punish ing the community in the process.""

Students react to dem onstration,"Compiled by Tommy Abel and Brian Hutchinson David Skena '92 BSG President - ""First of all, I was not there. My first reaction was disbelief. The way in which it happened was obviously not premeditated in any way. It was just an accident waiting to happen; morale's been low all semester. It's just the latest manifesta tion of student frustration caused by Act 31 and the policies that evolved from it. In the end result, I think it's going to be constructive. When you distill it down to what really happened, when you got up this morning, no buildings were burning, no windows were broken, nobody got hurt, nobody got arrested and afterwards the academic quad was cleaned by students."" Samantha Gladdish '91 Panhellenic Council President - ""It was primarily a product of some thing that has for some time been internalized. It had a lot to do with too many rules, restrictions, sanctions. Alcohol is a part of the issue, but a bigger part is that stu dents basically feel like they can't do what they really want to do. I feel that our student body is basi cally conservative, and for a gath ering of this scale to take place shows not only a sign of unifica tion but also that there are real problems needing real attention."" Mike Dominguez '91 IFC President - ""The event which occurred was an opportunity for the students to vent their anger and frustration over incidents and policies which have been occur ring for the past several years. It was unfortunate that the student gathering occurred in town on a weeknight, but it was not a planned or premeditated event. Although this event may have appeared to be solely cen tered around alcohol and under age drinking, I believe that the problems of student rights and an equitable policy are the larger issues. The media coverage por trayed the event as an unruly riot, when in fact the students were gen erally well controlled and no inju ries or vandalism resulted. I hope that the efforts by the administration previous to and after this occurrence will help to reduce student tensions and improve the state of morale at the university. The students of Bucknell should real ize that the administration and President Sojka in particular are working very hard to address and alleviate student concerns."" Tom Salus '91 Delta Upsilon President - ""It was unfortunate that 'the student gathering' occurred on the streets of Lewisburg and not on campus. I do not necessarily agree with this style of protest but I do think that it will have some positive effects. The administration of the university has its ""backs against the wall."" It is imperative that they create alternatives for a better social life on campus, immediately, or another gathering may occur. The problem of a declining social life at Bucknell had been known for quite some time, but now it must be solved. However, students should acknowledge that the administration has been working to improve university policies during this semester."" J.A. Shimer '93 - ""Students obviously vented a lot of frustra tion--frustration which has been building up. I think that the Bucknell student body has shown that it is not apathetic, that students will take an active role in determining the course of their lives. I think this says a lot of positive things about the Bucknell students."" Jeff Chaiken '93 - ""I think that this was inevitable with the Uni versity dragging its heels over the social issues. I hope that the violent aspect of this isn't going to overshadow the real reasons behind it, so that it will actually benefit the campus."" Mike Post '94 - ""It was pretty wild! I think that the police action was too much. The students weren't going to make anything big out of V____________________________________________________________ it, they were just pretty mad. President Sojka is going to have to make some sort of decision that will please everybody."" Ed Coady '91 - ""First of all, I was really surprised. I didn't think the students could shake off their usual apathy. Other than that, I have kind of mixed feelings because the university got a signal but at the same time a lot of people from town were understandably pissed off by the whole thing."" Chris Bender '93 - ""1 think it's one of the best things that's ever happened since I've been here. It's the first time this campus acted as a community, and even though it was chaotic, there was honest communi cation between the students and administration. It's important not to be blinded by the fact that alcohol was involved because the real issue was students desiring responsibility for themselves. The reason that all this occurred is because of the break- I down of communication on cam-"
I,"pus. This was the first time I've ever been proud of this school."" Susan Smith '93 - ""I think it places President Sojka between a rock and a hard place. He's going to have to intervene on the side of the students and move things back to campus and just tell the police he'll take care of it. We should have had a Halloween party in the academic quad or on the football field."" Ed Harhaj '92 - ""It is abso lutely essential that the administra tion view this show of dissent in the proper light. The news por trayed it as a bunch of drunks who were mad because they weren't allowed to drink. That grossly triv ializes the problem. We are upset because we are treated like chil dren. We do not have the power to affect our own destiny. The administration decides everything for us; whom we may associate with, how old they must be, and they even have the gaul to try to force some of us to have babysit ters in houses that we own. Things will only get better once the administration hears the student's voice, not just on security, but on all of those things that affect our lives. Students are supposed to grow in college; here the administration grows us."" Julie Mundorf '94 - ""It was crazy! They had dogs, and tear gas, and water cannons. I don't think that the students were out of line. It was a good way for the students' opinions to be heard. Obviously, Sojka has to do something."" Kara Cook '93 - ""I thought that last night was great! It was long ovcrdue.Xast night's protest was simply representative of the frustra tions of the' student body concerning the university's enforcement of its alcohol policy. Even if there was not alcohol present, they still would have broken it up. Masses of us gathering just drives them crazy. If we could gather like we did on Saturday afternoon or Wednesday night, there would be no motivation to leave campus."" Debra Ragusa '91 - ""On the whole it was a good thing, a produc tive action. It would have been more effective if the action hadn't occurred during an event involving police and potential violence. It would be even better to see students take similar actions under more positive circumstances."" Eric Belcher '91 Sigma Chi President - ""It's good to see the campus getting excited about a particular issue, but the whole thing seemed a little silly to me. The fact that our country is about to go to war makes the ""drinking issue"" seem relatively unimportant."" Wendy MacFarland '94 - ""It was good that students voiced their opinions and were heard. In general, it was handled the way it had to be; frustration had been mounting for some time."" ----------------- ---------------------------------------------------- -- --------------- j Colin Bridgewater/The Bucknellian President Sojka addresses the crowd at the library at approximately 1:30 a.m. Vincent DeCerchio and John Dunlop also responded to questions."
Frustrations,"From page 1 retorted. ""We have joined with a number of other private institutions in the state who in fact go to the legislature and ask for changes. In fact, our own legal counsel, Mr. Abelson, has been chosen as the lead legal counsel by the other [uni versities]. He is dealing with the representative who wrote that legis lation, and we're hoping for at least some amelioration of that law in the future."" Dunlop then addressed the crowd, saying ""We want to stay here tonight as long you have ques tions you want us to address. But we would also like to do this: we don't want this to be the end of the discussion tonight We're going to try to arrange a forum in the next 7 to 10 days. We're going to get together. We mean business about hearing you, and making whatever adjustments seem appropriate. I want everybody who's interested tonight to stay with us and come to the further discussions."" The next forum has already been scheduled for Tuesday, November 6, at 4 p.m. in Vaughan Literature Auditorium. Colin Bridgewater/The Bucknellian Hundreds of students gathered in the academic quad to hear administrators respond to student unrest. Administrators spoke from the entrance to the library."
Condoms,"From page 3 move beyond the present mode of distribution. ""We, as a University in the name of education and pre ventative medicine, need to pro vide something more."" It is uncertain if there will be any organized reaction on campus against the concept of making con doms more available to students. In 1989 members of the Intervar sity Christian Fellowship protested a Management 101 class that was selling condoms as part of their marketing project on the grounds that such activities promoted pre marital sex. In a telephone interview Timothy Emmett, the current presi dent of Intervarsity, said that he could not say how the organization would respond to an effort by the University to increase the availa bility of condoms on campus. Emmett suggested that there might not be a unified action on the part of Intervarsity, but that the individ ual members would respond as they saw fiL Some backlash, organized or otherwise, seems possible accord ing to Woods. It can be expected that part of the campus population will consider the expansion of con dom availability to be in promotion of promiscuity and pre-marital sex. Woods, though, is more concerned about those who would rather ignore the reality of sexual rela tions amongst students. ""It is the attitude that it is okay to have sex so long as you do not talk about it,"" Woods stated. ""But that is just the attitude that contributed to the AIDS crisis. Keeping things quiet does not solve problems and I do not think that if condoms were available on the campus it would make any more people decide to have sex."" Promiscuity defines the sex ual behavior of a significant por tion of the student population sometimes reflecting a belief that Bucknell is a safe place to have casual sex. Hoyle said, though, that promiscuity still represents risky sexual behavior. ""I believe that the risk at Bucknell is probably a little less than at a city college,"" Hoyle explained. ""But I do not believe that anyone that does not practice safe sex by the mere virtue of being at Bucknell is any less likely 1614 West Market St."

Cool, though, stated that he believed condom use has increased since 1987 and that students are more concerned about STDs and more careful in their sexual practises. At present Hoyle said he has only diagnosed one case of AIDS during his tenure at Bucknell and that was the engineering student Kevin Child '89. Child, a hemophi liac who was infected with the AIDS virus by means of a blood transfusion, died in the summer of 1989 from complications related to the virus. Further, Hoyle has not diag nosed anyone on campus as having the Human Immuno Deficiency virus, that is, as being HIV positive and a carrier of the AIDS virus. Instead of this being a sign for opti mism, Hoyle said that there are undoubtedly people who are HIV positive on campus and the fact that he has not diagnosed them may mean that they are also unaware of their condition. While AIDS is a constant and serious concern, there are other STDs that are more common and more of an immediate problem for the student population. According to Head Nurse Nancy Shuck, four cases of Chlamydia, a STD which commonly affects women and may cause infertility, have been diag nosed this academic year. Chla mydia often does not result in any symptoms, but sometimes is accom panied by the more common signs of burning during urination and ure thral discharge. Hoyle said that a condom effectively protects against an STD such as Chlamydia."

Servicemen die,
in Gulf mishaps,"Eleven American servicemen were killed Monday in two acci dents, raising the American death toll of Operation Desert Shield to 43. A ruptured valve spewed steam into the boiler room of the Iwo Jima, an anphibious assault ship anchored off the coast of Bah rain, killing ten sailors. A marine was killed and three others were injured when their vehicle over turned during maneuvers in the Saudi Arabian desert Richard Cheney, secretary of defense, expressed regret at the casualities. He cautioned, however, that with more than 210, 000 mili tary personnel practicing maneu vers on land, sea, and in the air with complicated machinery that ""accidents can't be avoided."""
Hussein orders,
troops on alert,"President Saddam Hussein of Iraq told his top generals to put his forces on ""extreme clert"" against the possibility of an Ameri can attack. Hussein responded to the growing impatience by western leaders over Iraq's continued occu pation of Kuwait. The Iraqi presi dent urged his forces to prepare for ""urban fighting"" in Kuwait The timing of the dispatch suggested that Hussien wanted to appear strong after Bush adminis tration officials renewed the possi bility that Iraq must be driven from Kuwait by force. In a speech Monday, Secretary of State James Baker said that there is ""a limit to the international community's patience"" and that the United States ""will not rule out the possi ble use of force if Iraq continues to occupy Kuwait"
Soviets may,
legalize hootch,"Soviet government attempts to curb alcohol consumption by limiting supply have failed, so the deputy police chief of Moscow announced a proposal to legalize moonshine in order to protect civil order. ""The holidays are coming and if the stores do not get more vodka to sell to the people, the sit uation might become explosive,"" deputy chief Lev Belyansky said, as his department conceded that there was an uncontrollable racket of overpriced illicit vodka. Moonshine vodka is increas ingly being made by Soviets, because the price of a bottle on the black market costs more than the average day's pay."
DeCerchio,"From page 3 its students, the new chief will take steps to form committees comprised of an assimilation of diverse student organization representatives. ""These committees will have a mission statement, objectives and long-term goals. We'll be doing work, we'll be moving swiftly,"" promises DeCerchio. The new director sees his department's role as part of the education process. His priority is to insure a safe place to study--an important task of which is to relate what he thinks is responsible drinking. Addressing the question of town relations, DeCerchio explained that because his depart ment has no jurisdiction in town, it is important to establish strong dip lomatic relations. Little did he know of the sequence of events that were to take place in town that night as DeCerchio left to insure that he wasn't late for Mr. Carter. With his term here at pacific Buck- nell not yet three weeks old, diplo matic relations in town are hardly being ameliorated. Most students feel that they are asking for nothing that is unfair or unreasonable. If the new chief is sincere with his approach in working together with students, his process will be facili tated far more effectively and posi tively than it was late Halloween Ashley Chertkof/The Bucknellian Vincent DeCercIo, director of security and safety, has been speaking with various student groups in attempts to eradicate problems with security's enforcement. DeCerchio has been here since October IS. On Wednesday night he spoke to the presidents of the sororities and members of the Panhellenic Council. On DeCerchio's agenda is the formation of an ad hoc committee comprised mainly of students in order to arrive at agreed upon procedures for his department. Ev"

Congress limits,
secret budget,"President Bush's power to spend funds on classified military programs faces new restrictions included in the 1991 military spending bill passed by Congress last week. The struggle between the Bush administration and Congress focused on the ""black budget"" of more than $35 billion hidden within the military spending bill. The secret budget provides money for secret weapons systems and intelligence activities. Congress in the past has attached classified reports to mili tary appropriations saying how the money should be spent. In the past the Bush administration has regarded these reports as expres sions of Congressional will rather than law. According to the new bill, Congressional restrictions are now legally binding, and Congress can monitor compliance through committees. The classified budget for foriegn intelligence and weapons in 1989 was $36 billion, more than the budg ets of the departments of Education, Labor, Transportation, or Veterans Affairs."
Shuttle fuel leak,
corrected,"The space shuttle fleet was described as ""leak-free"" and able to fly after the shuttle Columbia passed a test showing no excessive hydrogen leak during refueling. 'The team has found and fixed the problem and we can pro ceed with plans to launch Colum bia,"" said Robert Sleek, the Ken nedy Space Center's launching director. During the refueling of Columbia's large external tank a small amount of hydrogen leaked into the engine compartment, but officials said it was within accepta ble limits."
UAW-Chrysler,

The tentative agreement removed the prospect of a strike by Chrysler's 67,000 workers, a possi bility that appeared more likely as negotiations drew to a union- imposed deadline set Monday. Chrysler executives had said that they could not afford the types of packages that were reached with Ford and GM."

How admissions attempts to,
increase geographic diversity,"By David Soli Staff Writer According to U.S. News and World Report, Bucknell is ranked thisrty-sixth out of 141 Liberal Arts universities in the country. This rat ing upset a lot of people on cam pus. One can be sure, however, that the Admissions office is smiling. Bucknell is now seen as a national university, whereas a few years back it was generally seen as a regional institution. This change is, to some degree, a testament to Bucknell's expansion beyond its core student base of New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. Though Buckncll's efforts to increase geographic diversity are yielding some results, the basic makeup of the student body has not changed significantly over the past few years. In addition, Bucknell is likely to encounter increased diffi culty in attracting students from outside the East Coast as the num ber of applications will likely decrease due to demographic factors. James Stanton '51 com mented about Bucknell in his day, ""Almost everybody came from New York, New Jersey, and Penn sylvania. As an Ohioan I was a rar ity."" Only 9% of the class of 1951 came from outside of the East Coast. Things haven't changed sig nificantly; two thirds of the Fresh man class comes from either NY, NJ, or PA. It seems that these states will forever constitute the core of Bucknell's student body if recent figures are any indication. Ironically enough, with all the talk of increasing geographic"

iVh523-0050,"diversity here at Bucknell, the class of '94 is actually less ""geographi cally diverse"" than the class of '92. 16% of the class of '92 comes from outside the East Coast while only 12% of the current Freshman class resides outside of the East Coast. The class of '93 fares comparably with the class of '94 hovering around the 12% mark. According to Dick Skelton, former Director of Admissions, these numbers shouldn't be all that surprising. He notes, 'The effort to increase geographic diversity at Bucknell will take ten to twelve years to reveal itself."" When asked by a fellow Admissions officer how Bucknell was able to attract 11 Cal ifornians this year, he responded that Bucknell had worked the area for years and that the gains were just starting to reveal themselves. In an effort to increase repre sentation from outside the East Coast, an admissions officer spends a week on the West Coast and in the Midwest visiting high . ..... schools and giving presentations at college fairs. For the most part however, said Skelton, geographic diversity is increased primarily through word of mouth. Notes Skelton,"" When a student comes to Bucknell and has a good experience and tells the peo ple back home, that is the best advertisement Bucknell can get."" Though increasing geographic diversity is a goal of the Admis sions staff, they refuse to compro mise the normal admissions stan dards to do so. For instance, 60% of Pennsylvania applicants were accepted this year while only 51% of the applicants from the North Central region (the Midwest) were accepted. Usually however, the acceptance rate for regions outside the East Coast is higher than for Pennsylvania. This can most likely be attributed to Bucknell's reputa tion in Pennsylvania, whereas gen erally only top-notch students have heard of Bucknell outside the East Coast. In addition, noted Skelton, more Pennsylvania students tend to be committed to Bucknell as their first choice and thus remain on the waiting list from which a great number of students were taken this year. There are, however, miscon ceptions that must be addressed in assessing geographic diversity at Bucknell. Skelton commented that it isn't so much geographic diver sity that attracts the admissions office to a student, but rather the diversity of experiences that a stu dent brings to Bucknell. What the applicant did has more impact than where they did it. The Admissions _ _ _ _ _ staff tries to, in Skel ton's words, ""go with the person who is least rep resented here."" Aca- #"" demic abili ties still remain the predominant factor in deciding whether to admit an appli cant Though diversity is encour aged, the Admissions staff uses no quotas of any sort So what does it all mean? Geographic diversity is increasing over the long run, albeit very slowly. Only 10% of the class of '85 came from outside the East, whereas this number rose to only 12% with the class of '94. Perhaps if Bucknell gains a spot on the top 25 list of National Liberal Arts col leges, its geographic diversity will be enhanced."

The Collegiate,
Perspective...,
(and other fairy tales),"By Peter Lalos Staff Writer As it is again that time of the year when our campus is graced with the presence of a fresh batch of Bucknell prospec- tives, this week's column is ded icated to raising questions and concerns which those new to the university would like to ask, but never get around to in their orientation sessions. Actually, that's not the real reason at all for this week's column. Truth fully, I just feel like getting stu pid this time around. * Many universities across the nation have an academic pol icy dictating that, if ever your roommate passes away during the school year, you automati cally are given straight A's for that semester. This being the case, if you have a single and commit suicide one day, do you get a 4.0 forever? * Why do all the clueless students choose to shout out the wrong answers in class, while the smart people sit there and whisper the right answer to themselves? * On the whole, Bucknell University boasts one of the most picturesque campuses across the east coast, if not the nation. So what were they think ing when they put up those goofy orange iron sculptures like the one in front of Swartz Hall? Can you say, ""Leftover scrap metal""? * Who says Bucknell doesn't have an honest student body? I accidentally left a day- old copy of The New York Times in the caf coatroom over a week ago, and it's still there. * The other day I saw a message in the academic quad which read, ""Ban all chalk writ ing!"" ...

M aking sense of the m ail,"By Lisa Llpari Staff Writer Have you ever gotten a pink slip in your mailbox...and the pack age was for your boxmate? Or have you ever had classes all morning and a lab all afternoon, and you fig ured you'd have that important let ter weighed and sent during your lunch hour...and the post office in Marts Hall was closed? We've all experienced frustration at some point when dealing with the postal system here at Bucknell; and while it seems as though the system is at times inefficient, supervisor of mail distribution Art Moser says that this belief is simply not true. Moser claims that the main issue concerning mail distribution is speedy service. Incoming student mail (C-mail) is separated from regular campus mail such as faculty mail (F-mail) and other letters at the main downtown post office in Lewisburg. That student mail is then delivered downhill to the stu dent mailroom in the ELC, and all other mail is delivered uphill to the post office in Marts Hall, where the department and faculty mailboxes are located. The Marts Hall post office operates as a full service post office and provides the same ser vices that a regular U.S. post office does. (The Marts office is now open from 8:30 to 4:30 and no longer closes during lunch hour.) Moser pointed out that the mail- room located in the ELC is merely a convenience for students, and while it's true that stamps can only be bought six at a time, the students are lucky to have this service avail able to them. Students can also receive their packages at the ELC, which is evident by the telltale pink cards. (The physical plant serves the same purpose during the sum mer months when school is not in session.) Also located in the ELC is the switchboard office which receives packages delivered after 5:00 pm. Open until midnight every night, the switchboard office also receives other deliveries such as flowers and then notifies students by phone. While Marts Hall, the ELC mailroom, the switchboard, and the physical plant all serve as mail ""V : X depots, there is also the bookstore, where students can send packages through UPS. But, if you want to mail by Federal Express, take a hike up to Marts where that mail is sent It all sounds confusing and complicated you say? As men tioned before, the system is truly designed for the students' convenience."

Grateful Dead flies,
Without a  Net,"Jon Elliot Staff Writer It's been said that a Grateful Dead concert is unlike any other show on Earth. I assume that any one who's ever been to one of their concerts would agree. Since the release of the Dead's most recent albums. In the Dark and Built to Last, many critics have said the group has been con forming to the mainstream music of the '90s. But earlier this month, Arista released Without a Net, a compilation of fourteen live perfor mances recorded between October 1989 and April 1990. Produced by Grateful Dead bassist Phil Lcsh, Without a Net appeared on the shelves at a time when the band's future was in serious turmoil. Historically, live Grateful Dead albums have shown consider able promise in terms of song selection, but sound quality, even on Compact Disc, has left some thing to be desired. Without a Net is no different. The First Set (the title of the first disk) opens up with a keyboard sounding horn rhythm in ""Feel Like a Stranger,"" and the vocal back-up by Brent Mydland creates the free-flowing unconven tionally which has become the trademark of Grateful Dead concerts. Taking into account the time and efforts devoted to the massive efforts of listening to hundreds of hours of live tape to produce an album of such magnitude, ""...Stranger"" lacks a balancing lever between vocal and instrumen tal harmony. As one would some times hear on an average quality bootleg, Bob Weir's vocals on the opening track do not become audi ble until a few verses into the song. ""...Stranger"" followed up by another keyboard-influenced track, this time being a welcomed ""Mis sissippi Half-Step/ Uptown Toode- loo"" in which the spodight turns to the distinguishable vocals of lead guitarist Jerry Garcia. What starts off as a fast-paced (for Grateful Dead standards) jam on the ""Half- Step"" it eventually slows to the typ ical Garcia paced riffs in the transi tion and ultimately culminates in a mellow harmonizing on ""Uptown Toodeloo."" After a patented in-between- song ""tuning,"" the band breaks into one of the many ""blues"" songs which they perform in concert. This time the song is in the form of a Robert Johnson original, ""Walkin' Blues."" Bob Weir's vocal creativity here is only surpassed by his talent on the slide guitar. After a quite lengthy keyboard solo, ""Walkin' Blues"" slowly fades into a muffled crowd response and rebounds into the Garcia-styled rhythm of ""Althea."" The emotion in Garcia's voice adds a story line to the chords which almost turns the pages of another one of the Dead's story book songs. Weir again emerges from behind his rhythm guitar to provide the listener with the airy sounds of a powerful ""Cassidy."" And although it too is abbreviated, this jam provides the listener with an Copyright G.D.M., Inc. 1990 Courtesy o f Arista Records, Inc. The Grateful Dead's new album was released following the death of the band's keyboardist, Brent Myd land. The timing of the release is ironic since many of the pieces at the end of the album feature the talents of the late Mydland. essence of weightlessness, carried on by what we see as one of the Dead's smoothest creations, that being the sounds of Garcia's ""Bird Song."" Nearly thirteen minutes long, it is here where Garcia's magic is first acknowledged on the album. His ability to create the sounds of a flute through the strings of his gui tar, and the accompaniment of Mydland's action on the keyboards allows the listener to get caught up in the magic and diversity of what has come to be known as the Grate ful Dead. At one point, this ""Bird Song"" almost comes to a complete stop, as a bird would after a long flight in order to rest its wings, and almost like magic it gathers its form and rhythm once again to emerge with the grace and tranquil ity of a bird in flight. Atypical of most first sets of a Dead show, we see this first set commence with one of the groups oldest creations in their twenty-five year career. The powerful lyrics of ""Let It Grow"" become muffled by the instrumental abilities of Myd land, thus presenting him as the group member many people had hoped would become a major con tributor to the Dead's new sound for the '90's. As a conclusion, Weir finishes off the first set with a pat ented ""We'll be back in just a little bit,"" leaving the listener ready for what proves to be a fine representa tion of the Grateful Dead in rare second set form. Highlighted with one of the Dead's most acclaimed perfor mances of ""Eyes of the World"" and an accompaniment by saxophonist Branford Marsalis on their recent stint at Nassau Coliseum, the Sec ond Set begins with an energy packed rendition of their famed ""China Cat Sunflower/ I Know You Rider"" in which the vocal tal ents of Garcia, Weir, and Mydland are captured with tremendous detail. Weir's ""Looks Like Rain"" is the next song, and although the sounds of Garcia's guitar create the uncanny sounds of a warm summer rain, the vocals seem to be sup pressed by the band's instrumental unity, notably the sounds of Myd land's keyboards. The smooth transition into Garcia's ""Eyes..."" with Marsalis on sax exemplifies the diversified character which has recently been undertaken by the band, and not more evident than in ""Victim Or the Crime,"" one of the few Weir contributions to last year's release. Built to Last. Although not as instrumcntally creative as previous selections, strangely enough, the vocals are much more technologi cally in sync with the instrumental aspect of the music than they are on previous Weir inclusions. What may be the true high light for many fans is the group's choice to include ""Help on the Way/ Slipknot!/ Franklin's Tower"" in a work which was already included three other patented ""openers"" (songs which the Dead usually perform at the beginning of a set). And although such jams on ""Bird Song"" and ""Looks Like Rain"" may be great in terms of their ability to reflect a feeling or vision, ""Help.../ Slip."
J,"Frank..."" is what could be seen as an all out jam. The concept of blending three distinctive songs into one flowing creation is a talent magically cap tured throughout Without A Net. Traditionally, no Saturday night performance is complete without one of the true crowd pleasers, ""One More Saturday Night."" The Grateful Dead, on pre vious live albums, seemed to have had difficulty in creating the sense of their live performances on vinyl, but this version of their Saturday night special may even get even the most avid critic of the Dead tapping his foot. It is here that I feel that Without a Net should have ended. Producer Phil Lesh's decision to tack on the Mydland version of Traffic's ""Dear Mr. Fantasy"" after ""One More Saturday Night"" left a saddened taste in my mouth. In ret rospect, at least prior to Mydland's death in July, 1990, it seems that this album was intended to capture the ""new life"" of the Grateful Dead; one full of energy and emotion. Therefore, a ""...Fantasy"" to end the Second Set makes me wonder what Lesh had in mind when choosing the song selection and placement. .Ironically, though, Mydland's ""...Fantasy"" could not have been any more practical with respect to the relativity of Mydland's life story."

Speaking,
Marred with Distaste,"By Lee Guzofski Staff Writer Greetings BuckncII! I hope you all collectively had a joyous Halloween and received many treats. Unfortunately, it was my distinct bad luck to have been ""tricked"" into seeing Marked for Death, starring Steven Segal. I don't know, maybe a black cat crossed my path... Marked for Death was the story of ""retired"" cop John Hatcher (a nice MASCULINE name) who comes home to rest, only to discover a Jamaican ""posse"" or gang is threatening his lovely suburb with drug traffick ing. Hatcher is willing to look the other way until the bad guys injure his 13 year old niece while attempting to gun him down. Thus, the plot... This movie was the poorest, lamest, most vile, disgusting excuse for entertainment I think I've ever seen (with the exception of Robocop 2). I've never heard or seen more disgusting sound effects in a film before. The plot was sim ply too predictable in that nice, yet tough, 'cop wants a vacation' way (as in Die Hard, Commando, and countless other films). The only thing that made this film tolerable (no, tolerable is too strong a word); the only reason I didn't bolt upright and leave was primar ily that I wasn't paying to see the film with my own money. At any rate, another reason I didn't leave was that there was indeed an update on modern gore effect technology. You'll all be happy to know that the simulated bone-breaking industry is indeed alive and well, which is more than I can say for Segal's victims. As an interesting addition to this article, I decided to personally interview each member of the audience (there were eight of us). I felt a bond with these people. We all squirmed with disgust at the same parts, and moaned with anguish at the same parts. I felt a bond, that is, until I talked to them... The other six people in the theater, barring myself and my companion, appeared to be excited to see this film. After the wretched thing I couldn't wait to get some verbal outlashes from these people. Boy, was I sur prised. If I may quote; 'Tame... great... a cool movie... 2 thumbs up... love Ste ven Segal... I personally liked the eye gouging, culcium cracking, bone-breaking action..."" Well, there you have it. Meanwhile, my companion kept screaming one word, ""Reimbursement!"" This film was horrid, abso lutely disgusting. The reggae music was a treat, even though they played the same song through the whole film, but I haven't heard that many bones cracking since my Aunt Esther tried to bend over to pick up her remote control. If nothing else came of my trip to see this film, at least I got to meet the people who thrive on action, violence, and bloodbath genre films -- all six of them...Have a nice yesterday and a pleasant next Thursday."

Homecoming provided on and off-campus talent,"By Cynthia Levinson Staff Writer Wednesday night will mark the second concert in the Gallery Series performances. The first con cert was performed by the Soldier String Quartet and proved to be an interesting and rather eductional evening of entertainment. The quar tet played a variety of progressive pieces, some of which were origi nals and others which were bor rowed or adapted pieces. Needless to say, the quartet made quite an impression upon the audience with their unique style. The musicians were quite interesting in that their performance was drastically differ ent from a typical quartet perfor mance. The group was comprised of two women and two men, all of whom proved themselves to be very talented musicians. The strik ing aspect of their style was their enthusiasm and movement while performing. It was anything but a conventional evening of entertainment. The upcoming performance should prove to be notably different from the first. This is not to say that it will be conservative, just that it will provide the audience with another interesting and different evening of contemporary music. The performer will be a man named Oscar Pizzo in his first per formance in America. Pizzo is a pianist who has studied piano, as well as organ and experimental composition. His program will be a ""panorama of avant-garde Italian music of the last decade."" Not only will this perfor mance be his premiere performance in the United States, but it will also feature two pieces which have not been publically performed as of yet. These pieces, ""una dolcezza inquita"" by Mauro Bagella and ""COCKAMAMEY"" by Diego Min- chiacchi, were both written for the piano. Pizzo has perticipated in a number of European festivals including the Darmstadt Summer Course for New Music and another recent music festival in Rome. Some of his performances have been broadcast by Radio France, Sudwestfunk Baden-Baden, and Radio Tclcvisione Italiana. Pizzo has also recorded on the Edipan label. By Jill Myrom Staff Writer The Rooke Chapel Choir, the Brewer Chamber Orchestra, and four individual soloists teamed up to perform Handel's opera Acis and Galatea on the first night of Homecoming. Rudolph Palmer, a 1973 Bucknell graduate, conducted the ensemble. The choir, instrumentalists, and individual singers complemented one another well, on the whole creating a strong rendition of the opera. While the Chapel Choir dominated the stage visually, its role in the actual production was unfortunately a minor one, due to the way the opera was written to be performed. The dominant actors of the evening were the two main characters, Acis and Galatea, who were performed by Grayson Hirst and Julianne Baird, a tenor and a soprano with impressive accomplishments. Joining them as soloists were Frederick Urrey, a tenor, singing the part of Damon, and John Ostendorf, a bass. Osten- dorf played the part of Polyphe mus beautifully, his rich, low voice embodying the ill the char acter bodes for the poor Galatea. The Brewer Chamber Orchestra did an impressive job with the score, striking a good bal ance with the singers by being nei ther overbearing, nor, at the other extreme, drowned out by the voices. Behind the orchestra stood the 49 students who made up the Chapel Choir. Their singing reflected the long hours put in by the students and William Payn, their conductor. An unfortunate aspect of the chorus pertained to the costumes the women were required to don. Their cerulean blue dresses looked most uncomfortable, not to mention breast-emphasizing. Though the audience's attention was visually drawn by the sea of blue women, the choir only sang during seven of the eighteen songs. The three elements of the opera (the choir, orchestra, and soloists) seemed especially divided and sep arated from one another due to their arrangement on the stage and the difference in costume for each group, making it difficult to con centrate fully upon the work. An air of gloom seemed to hang like a cloud over the majority of the choir, which did indeed match the mood of Act II, though it seemed out of place in the first act when the choir sang such lyrics as, ""Happy, happy, happy we! What joys I feel, what charms I see..."" The choir sang with strength and pleasing harmony; many of us wished to hear more from them in the opera. The simple plot structure per haps lent itself to the insipid lyrics which occasionally popped up in the course of the night. Polyphe mus, a Cyclops, falls in love with Galatea, an exquisite nymph. Unwilling to return the affections of such a monster, Galatea instead loves a shepherd named Acis. They are blissfully happy until Polyphemus' envy leads him to kill Acis, crushing him beneath a boulder. Grieving, Galatea turns the shepherd into a river. The original myth did not include the character Damon, but Handel added him as a commentator. While Handel's style of opera is not intended to be acted out with costumes and a set, a measure of perceptible acting was included by both Galatea and Pol yphemus. Even when not singing, Polyphemus would subtly react to the words of the other characters through facial expression. The awkwardness of not acting out the plot more fully became evident after Acis had supposedly been killed, when he remained seated on stage, following the score as the others wound down the production. It was unfortunate to note that very few students were in attendance. The audience seemed to be made up primarily of local residents and university faculty and staff. A number of those I did not recognize were most likely alumnae returning for Homecom ing. The crowd responded posi tively to the production, but this should not be surprising. Handel's style in Acis and Galatea is closely akin to his well- knownWater Music, and so he is a sure-fire crowd-pleaser, ideal for occasions such as Homecoming. By Ashley Shrader Staff Writer The Department of Theater and Dance announces the residency of the Victoria Marks Performance Company, which will extend through November third and fourth. The residency will provide Dance Company members and other inter ested students with an opportunity to take classes from a professioal artist cited by the New York Press as ""one of the most gifted young choreographers today."" Victoria Marks is interested in what she calls ""educating peo ples' feelings"" through dance: ""I want us to know more, to deal with complexity, to be less afraid, to care more and to recognize our lim its. I make dance for this purpose."" Marks emphasizes the impor tance of dance for high school and college students; she strongly believes that exposure to the arts provides students with alternative ways of comprehending the world. ""Asthctic education,"" she says, ""requires the type of coun- sciousness that has seemingly been omitted from most school discus sions and lesson plans. The skills the arts develop are the very ones that tune up intuition and make con tact with deep feelings. They demand a combination of innocence and thoroughness, a duo not often reinforced in school or at home. I think these two skills combine in such a way as to create an environ ment that permits compassion."" Marks is a graduate of Sarah Lawrence College. From 1979-84 she was a member of Rosalind Newsman and Dancers. She started choreographing in New York in 1981 and has since been awarded grants from the New York Founda tion for the Arts (1985) and the National Endowment for the Arts (1986, 1987, 1989, 1990) for her choreographic acheivement. Marks has been a guest teacher at Bates College, London Contemporary Dance School, Hunter College, and the Harvard Summer Dance Program. She has taught both school children and their teachers through the Lincoln Center Institute, NYC's Arts Con nection, Boston's Cultural Eduction Collaborative, London's South Bank Center, and at Bates College in Maine. She has been giving dierction to Pcntaclc's pilot pro gram in New York City's inner city"

The wheels are in motion,
Student frustration erupted Wednesday night in what could have been a,
"tragic incident. Thanks to key administrators and student leaders, who saw the",
"5-hour demonstration to its end at 3:30 a.m. in front of the Bertrand Library, this",
latest show of discontent ended without injury or major property damage.,
"President Sojka, Associate Vice President Weddle, Dean Dunlop and newly",
appointed Director of Security and Safety Vincent DeCerchio managed to,
coerce close to 200 police into giving students a chance to move their demon,
stration back on campus.,
"Once on campus, administrators showed their willingness to listen to and",
address student concerns. Students should now realize that their voices are being,
heard and their concerns are being actively addressed.,
In coming weeks we will all be tested. The administration must now live up,
to the promises made early Thursday morning and begin to act proactively,
instead of reactively.,
Students will be tested in a different way. We must now show the adminis,
tration that we are willing take responsibility for our actions and act in a mature,
"manner. Live up to the expectations of our peers, administration and neighbors",
in Lewisburg. With more freedom also comes more responsibility.,
As the media of the Susquehanna Valley portrays Wednesday night's events,
"as a ""group of drunken kids"" upset over Pennsylvania drinking laws, we must be",
reminded that the central issue should not be Act 31. The University cannot,
"stand idly by, allowing students to violate state law.",
"Accountability, equity and fairness are the issues. The days of an overzeal-",
ous Department of Security and Safety are over. The administration is finally,
ready to address our concerns and create a system in which everyone in the Uni,
versity Community knows the rules of the game.,
The point has been made. We have the administration's attention; use it.,

Senior attacks administration survey,"To the Editor: I'm sure that my opinion could be more eloquently stated by a member of our more articulate administration, but I doubt that it would attract much notice. People speaking in their own defense are always dismissed as being totally biased. But it's time that the Buck nell community hear from a student that supports the administration. I've had it with professional staff bashing! Before I get into the atrocious article printed in last week's Buck nellian about their survey, I'd like to state my personal views about the administration. I have worked with many administrators on Orien tation over the past two years, mainly with people from the Divi sion of Student Life. Because these are the people who have the most contact with the students, they are also the ones subjected to the most criticism--and their policies are the ones that directly affect students, so it is important that they are able to relate to the students and under stand them. Just from my limited personal experience 1 can say that the Student Life staff were by far assist students in pursuing a posi tive college experience. However, they are human--they all make mistakes at one time or another and they all have personality flaws, just like the students (including the Bucknellian staff). Students tend to forget this, but since I have become"
...the graphs and tables take up,
almost twice as much space as the,

This may surprise you, but these people did not enter their chosen field to enforce regulations and discipline students. Rather, they are college administrators because they want to friends with many staff members, I can testify to the fact that they are just normal people. They like stu dents and want to get along with them and make them satisfied members of the Bucknell community."
Professor requests correction,
on Bucknell ranking article,"To the Editor: I trust that others in the Bucknell community have written to you requesting corrections to your article of Oct. 12,1990. Your major mistake is understandable. You say that ""Bucknell was ranked at the top of the second quartile..."" instead of some thing like Bucknell was ranked in the top quartile but not among the top twenty-five within the quartile. It took a number of page turnings with the tables in the U.S. News and World Report for me to see how they had constructed their tables. May I point out that your second paragraph is misleading as well. The list of items suggests differ ent items rather than just the headings within the table. The problem is that some of the items are iden tical. For example: student satisfaction = graduation rates financial resources = total spending per student Labels do make a difference, don't they, even if the information remains the same? That the infor mation does stay the same is difficult to see. It is hid den in all of that percentile transfer stuff in the fine print by the tables. One way of writing that second paragraph would have been to insert the phrase ""which were based on"" between the item ""...student satisfaction"" and the item ""SAT/ACT scores..."" in your para graph. Also you might have had to add something since academic reputation was based on ratings of administrators, not in your list. Psychologists tell us that the left-upper portion of a display such as your article in the newspaper receives primary attention. It adds emphasis to requests for a correction in a future issue of The Bucknellian. David Milne Associate Professor Psychology Department October 17,1990 As for the ""survey analysis"" in last week's Bucknellian by Brian Davison, the flaws in the article seem so apparent that it's almost redundant to point them out, but to satisfy myself and my administrator friends, I will. First, this half-page article with huge graphs-- including one on the front page--is based on the 11 % return rate of the 288 surveys sent out. In other words--it's based on the opinions of 32 people, about 1% of the stu dent body. Not very thorough. Sec ond, the graphs and tables take up almost twice as much space as the print, but nowhere are any of the numbers on them explained. The caption to the graph on the front page states: ""Administrators were tated from 1 to 10."" What do the numbers mean and what were they rated on? How well they dress? If it was, the numbers probably would have been drastically different. The caption only says that Bucknell upperclassmen were polled on their opinions. Third, although the title See SURVEY, page 11"
Student responds to,
philanthropy article,"To the Editor: I am writing in response to the article in the October 26th edition of The Bucknellian, which noted the philanthropic achievements of eight of the fra ternities and sororities at Buck nell. I applaud The Bucknellian for its efforts to publicize the beneficial aspects of Greek life at Bucknell; however, I feel the article presented a limited view of the Greek philanthropic activi ties which take place on our campus. There are 20 Greek frater nities and sororities at Bucknell, as well as other service organiza tions such as Alpha Phi Omega and Habitat for Humanity. Surely the service projects of all these organizations deserve rec ognition. More specifically. Delta Gamma's Anchor Splash, which will take place this Satur- day, November 3, from 1-4 p.m., is a campus-wide swim meet which the sorority organizes and sponsors annually. The swim meet is open to the entire campus and raises nearly $1000 for the Williamsport and Sunbury Branches of the Pennsylvania Association for the Blind and the Delta Gamma Foundation. Anchor Splash is just one example of the variety of philan thropic activities which were overlooked in The Bucknellian's article on October 26th. I encour age The Bucknellian ,to extend recognition and credit to the many organizations omitted from the article. Sincerely, Andrea Wealand '91 Foundation Chairman Delta Gamma Sorority October 29,1990"
Seniors question inconsistency,
of tailgating alcohol policy,"To the Editor: If you were at the tailgating party on Saturday, you may feel the same way we do. It all started Par ents Weekend three weeks ago. For some peculiar reason, Bucknell Security adopted a laissez-faire atti tude when dealing with the ""open- container"" drinking which was ram pant outside Christy Mathewson Stadium. The scene was set on that Saturday afternoon, parents, alumni, and students (legal and not) alike, consuming alcohol with little concern for the rules and regula tions governing this institution. If you happened to glance at the Security Log of last week's Buck nellian, no alcohol violations were reported. It wasn't until this past week end that we truly noticed Buck- nell's policies were becoming, if they hadn't already, inconsistent In our four years as Bucknell students, we've seen the alcohol policies regarding student ""controlled"" social activities become more and more stringent. However, adminis trative hands-off policies regarding the consumption of alcohol at events like Homecoming tailgating parties and Parents Weekend have continued to be maintained. By 11 a.m. out on Swartz field, the kegs were flowing and the Pounders were being pounded, and Security seemed blind to all around them. They were out there mingling among the alcohol consuming stu dents and alumni, yet there was no ""21 year old section"" and no I.D. inspection. So let's get something straight; when it comes to parents and alumni, the economic force behind the upkeep of this Univer sity, school and state alcohol poli cies are waived. However, when See TAILGATING, page 11"
Reporting of Administration,
survey lacks statistical integrity,"By Travis Elliott The article in last week's bucknellian entitled, ""Administra tion receives mid-term grades"" piade a number of inferences from a survey which simply does not stand up to statistical scrutiny. Perhaps the article should have been titled ""Student apathy abounds"" since only 11% of the 288 upperclass students contacted responded to the survey. No defi nite conclusions can be drawn as to the overall opinion of upperclass students from the opinions of only 31 students because of the extremely low response rate of only 11 %. However, in the article, Brian Davison '91 reports, ""Overall bpinions of Bucknell have declined, both among Greeks and independents."" A number "" -- pf weaknesses fcxist in this claim. First, the sampling method used in the survey, pamely sending put a direct mail Survey, is a poor method of collecting data. Would students who are particularly upset with the administration and Buck nell be more likely to respond to the survey? Of course, they would. Those who have strong opinions will take the time to fill out the sur vey and return it while those who have more moderate opinions would most likely throw the survey away. If the survey was conducted in a different manner, the response rate could have been greatly improved and the results would be more definitive. For instance, by polling students over the phone, the survey would have been able to get a much higher rate of response than 11%, and hence, the survey results would have been more representative of "" the overall upperclass stu dent opinion at Bucknell. Furthermore, the claim that upperclassmen's opinions of the University have declined relative to last year, is completely unfounded. No survey was conducted at this perceived their opinions of the Uni versity. to have been higher last year at this time, but perception changes significantly over time. People often idealize the past"

Survey,"' From page 10 and accompanying visual aids Iclaim that the survey slams the administration, only one paragraph is actually about the administration. *The rest is about the changing social scene on campus, which has mainly been a result of Act 31. ;Somehow the students have been managing to peg the responsibility for this law on the administration because they have had to enforce it, as if the 21-year-old drinking age law was written by the Bucknell administration. One of my roommates received the Bucknellian survey, but she never answered it because she felt that she didn't know any of the administrators well enough to give an opinion of them. I wonder how many of those 32 respondents actually know those people well enough to give an informed opinion of them. I, on the other hand, know these administrators, and, while they would not all receive a 10 on the rating scale, if that is indeed the"
Tailgating,"From page 10 these individuals leave the school, the school and state alcohol poli cies are once again enforced, prov ing that, as we have seen, Bucknell students do not account for much. So, if you are going to insti tute rules regarding the serving and consumption of alcohol on campus, then let them be fair, just and con sistent If you play fair with us, then we'll play fair with you. And to tell you the truth, Saturday after noon was the best time we had all semester. It wasn't because we were intoxicated, but rather because we knew that we could highest, they would all score much better. Of course, this brings up another point. Whose fault is it that none of these students know the administrators well enough to give an informed opinion? Why is it that I do know them? It's certainly not due to any lack of effort on the part of the administration. Students are constantly being begged to get involved, most recently with TIP, but also with BSG, B AC, Orienta tion. . .the list is nearly endless. Even the trustees allowed students to meet with them, and they showed a genuine interest in the students' concerns. It's difficult for the administrators to get out and meet all the students, but they do their best, and the students need to make more of an effort to get involved at Bucknell and its staff before they criticize either too harshly. Sincerely, Julie L. Shurilla '91 October 30,1990 hang out with our friends and enjoy our first Saturday afternoon know ing that we didn't have to worry about being unfairly hassled by the ""long-arm of Bucknell's law."" So Bucknell, if you expect us to deal with you with warm hearts and open wallets upon graduation, then we expect you to deal with us as mature, free-thinking responsible students, alumni, parents, and of course, as human beings. Jon Elliot '91 Andy Zelhof '91 Laith Jazrawi '91 dom method, then the sample of 288 students was not representative of the student population at Buck nell. Unfortunately, no conclusions can be deduced in these areas because the relevant information about the survey did not appear in the article, but it does leaves the reader to wonder. The hy pothesis that the upperclass stu dents are dissatis fied with the Uni versity and the administration is a reasonable one, but it remains just that, a hypothesis, until it is backed up with reliable statistical proof. Per haps this article would have been better placed on the opinions page than the news section. As a news article, the inconclusive nature of the statistical survey results should have been stressed. In any case, this illustrates the importance of statistical integ rity in reporting. Irresponsible reporting of survey results not only weakens the credibility of the press, but it also provides evidence for those who would claim that the news reported in The Bucknellian is biased. As a Contributing Editor, I hope that we have learned some thing from this experience and will be more prudent in reporting sur vey results and statistics in the future."
Freshman Forum,"By Jim Joseph Last weekend, as we all know, was Homecoming. For me, this should be a time of great school spirit and unity. This last word is important. Unfortunately, it seemed to many freshmen as if this celebration did not include them. Of course they went to the football game and cringed at the heartbreaking loss to Colgate. But that did not fill the whole weekend. The problem arose when we asked ourselves what to do after the game. Alumni went back to their fraternities or sororities, as did all of the current members of the Greek system. But where could the freshmen go? We do not in any way blame the Interfratemity Council for this minor dilemma. It is their right to decide if at cer tain times it is not in their best interests to admit freshmen into their houses, and I am sure that on this weekend they had strong reasons for arriving at this deci sion. However, it is known that on the normal weekend the frater nities are a great source of recrea tion for freshmen. So, on the one weekend when they decide not to let us into their houses, shouldn't somebody somewhere have offered alternative activities for the freshmen? I think that the answer to this question is an emphatic ""YES."" After all, this is the school which is so adamantly against under-age drinking. What do they think generally happens when some 900 students do not have anything to do on a week end? The inevitable result is heavy drinking in the dormitories. Now I know that many of you think that this occurs on any weekend. But when there are no bands to listen to and no movies to watch, what is the final alterna tive? Homework? Let's not kid ourselves. There must be some sort of activity planned for fresh men when there is no alternative recreation. I feel that it is the responsi bility of the BAC, the administra tion, and the BSG to make enter tainment available. Anything would suffice: a band, a movie, even a comedian in the Weis Cen ter. If the availability of such activities keeps five people from drinking then the administration has helped to avoid potential trou ble for that handful and for those who still choose to drink, some from of entertainment has been offered to enhance their jovial manner. The important thing is that an effort is made to satisfy everybody and the attitude of the powers-that-be does not leave the freshmen to fend for themselves. This way, nobody can complain. The effort was made and if some body did not have fun then it's their fault. The rest of us can still go out and have a good time."
Pleasantness pales to free speech,"By M.D. Christopher I would like to comment upon the brief article about Buck nell University in the October 14 issue of the New York Times, p. 39. For those of you who are not informed, the issue which brought our University the attention of the largest single newspaper in the entire world was the attempt by the Bucknell Student Government to ban the use of chalk as a form of expression on the campus. I would like to express my concern for Mr. Eisenstein, whose use of the word ""esthetics"" was, at best, awkward, and at worst, incor rect. Use a dictionary, Mr. Eisen stein, before you allow yourself to be quoted by the New York Times."
I,"would also like to point out that within the confines of your argu ment, the insipid allowance that ""though the content of the writing may have credible thoughts and opinions..."" is merely giving lip- service to the idea that the accep tance and exploration of ideas, political or otherwise, is a valuable quality in an individual and in a society. Don't bother. I would like to thank, on the other hand, Brian Selmeski, the junior class representative who had the sense, or lacked the political savvy, to point out the obvious: the essence of a liberal arts institution is the ideal that ""There should be no restriction on intellectual thought and expression."" I person ally feel that it is possible for a group such as P.O.W.E.R. to exist at Bucknell because all other forms of expression for their ideas have been severely oppressed, or silenced. I found tremendous resis tance to the discussion of feminism and women's issues, and even to simple outspokenness on any sub ject by a female, during my years here. Wake up, people; women's issues are not a dying subject, the Women's Movement is not over, and Feminism is a fantastically diverse title covering many issues and many viewpoints, many of them conflicting. Bucknellians, stu dents, faculty and administration, may try to silence the voices of to the chalk talk see the appearance of the writing as a defacement of the university's property. I don't think they're trying to curtail free speech or freedom of expression."" For all of those who wish to pursue a career in American politics, listen closely. Dean Dunlop has reduced the argument to its two viewpoints: those who wish to change this pris tine, ""traditional"" environment, but when an entire issue of Time Maga zine (this week's) is devoted to the current issues involving women, how long can you afford to keep your eyes, and your minds, closed? As a sterling example of the above, I would submit to you this fine piece of political bullshit of which our esteemed Dean Dunlop is a master non pared. 'The vast majority of our students who object the right to freedom of expression and the issue of private property. The only way that the chalking could be banned to preserve visual pleasantness, as Mr. Eisenstein desired, would be on the grounds that the campus is private property. Those who favor freedom of expression are either in agreement with the issues that are being raised by this political activity, or they are aware that the curtailment of any particular political view leads to the oppression of all political dialogue, and they are more concerned with preserving their own rights than curtailing those of others. Thus, pri vate property or no, they support the freedom of expression on the campus. Those who oppose free dom of expression, on the other hand, must come up with some thing other than ""I oppose first amendment rights."" The answer is to avoid at all costs the issue of freedom of expression completely, and maintain that the chalk writing, no matter what the content, is offensive because it detracts from the neat appearance of the grounds of the University. Here is the clever part, folks; by addressing only one side of the argument, Dean Dunlop masks his personal views behind the view he attributes to certain stu dents, carefully stating that an unknown number of them are opposed to the chalking, but that of those students, a vast majority are against the writings only for the sake of campus tidiness. In the world of politics, it seems, one must not acknowledge opposing arguments in any way. Thus, he hands over to those students who wish to be spared the constant exposure to political views radi cally different than their own opin ions a clear and smugly neutral rea son for supporting this desire. I enjoyed the blatant contrast between the words of the above administrator and the President of the Bucknell Student Government, David Skena: ""I'm afraid that a lot of the students wanted to ban the chalk talk strictly because of the content of the messages. The writ ings bother me, but I don't think it's proper to shut it off."" Like Mr. Selmeski, Dave Skena has the sense, or lacks the political savvy, to state the obvious."

Field hockey finishes,
season with 3-0 loss,"By Ju lie M cCausland and Scooter Van K irk Staff Writers The women's field hockey team ended their 1990 season last Tueday, bowing to Ursinus in a 3-0 loss, and culminating in a record of 4-12-1. Entering into the newly formed Patriot league, Bucknell anticipated close, equally matched contests from schools with similar athletic and academic programs. Included in the Patriot league are old E.C.C. rivals Lehigh and Lafay ette and new conference members Colgate and Holy Cross, the latter of which the Bison had never played. Finishing 1-3-0 in the con ference netted the Bison fourth place just ahead of Lehigh. With the entire squad return ing next year the Bison are main taining their core nucleus, which is quintessential to any cohesive play ing unit. >ue Wells '93 summar ized,"" We aren't losing any seniors, we have the entire off-season to work out any kinks, and from this point things can only get better."" The Bison travelled to Phila delphia hoping to end their 1990 season with a much-needed win. But it was not to be. The Bison sur rendered 29 shots and three goals to the Bears while generating only 13 shots of their own. Both Bucknell goalies got a work out with Danielle Ward '93 totalling 16 saves with three goals against in the first half and Jen Corrigan '94 mak ing 12 saves in the second. Coach Jen Averill com mented, ""There were some close ones where we could have capital ized there in the second half."" Unfortunately, the Bison couldn't muster that last push. In what could only be termed as ""disappointing,"" by team co captain Jeanette Aurand ('92), the Bison fell to longtime rival Drexel on Monday by a score of 2-1. The Drexel Dragons scorched the Bison with their heated intensity, driving in both of their goals in the first half. Drexel kept goalie Ward busy forcing her to make thirteen saves, while Drexel's goalie went practi cally uncontested with four saves. The Bison, who were down the entire game, managed to score with just eight minutes remaining in the second half. The goal was scored by Stef Carfley '93 and assisted by Jeanette Aurand. The Bison have suffered from lackluster play at times this year and must hope to bring a more consistent effort to their games in the 1991 season. They aspired to the level of play o f nationally ranked Delaware (#18), earning a 0- 0 tie and then conceded to a sub stantially subpar Division III team, and one has to wonder where they stand and if they have the drive to be competitive on a day to day basis. It is conceivable that the loss of half of the forward line to inju ries hampered the Bison's bid for conference victories. Almira Bald win '94, who was named Patriot league player of the week for her winning efforts and finished third in team points, and speedster Alison Arth '93 were both lost to ankle injuries near the end of their 1990 season. One can only speculate to what extent their absence has affected the team's overall cohe siveness, and anticipate their return for next year. Looking towards next sea son, Coach Averill is confident that her team will successfully attain the cohesiveness it found elusive many times this year. With the entire team returning, coupled with the fact that it has been playing together for such a long time, Ave rill feels the team will have an edge over younger teams. The Bison will capitalize on their maturity and game sense which they have devel oped over the years."

Volleyball finishes last in league,"By Todd Bianchine Staff Writer The beleaguered women's volleyball team will put an end to a dismal season tomorrow when they face off against Coach Opalski's former squad, the Golden Eagles of Clarion University. Bucknell was unable to give their new coach any league wins in the inaugural Patriot League sea son, as they lost its final two con ference matches to Lehigh and Lafayette last weekend. However, Opalski is quick to point out sev eral improvements. ""Our work ethic has defi nitely improved,"" said Opalski, ""and a result of this greater work ethic is individual improvement. Also, we have one of the best side- out games in the league, meaning we play pretty well on defense, its just that our offense has to get going. Finally I think our transition game, where we switch from offense to defense is improving, a little late but perhaps in time for the tournament."" Bucknell's first match last weekend was against the Lady Leopards o f Lafayette, who came in the match with a 7-12 record, 1-4 in the conference. The Lady Bison came out strong and snagged the first game 15-12, behind powerful serving by co-captain Kris Colbert '91 and Stacy Sontheimer '92. Each had five service winners in the match. However, Lafayette responded by taking the next three games 15-13, 15-11, 16-14, but not without a strong fight from Buck- nell's other co-captain Kara Forosi sky '92, who had 16 kills for the match along with two aces. ""We had an excellent serving match, but we just weren't able to muster up enough momentum,"" stated Opalski. ""Lafayette was defi nitely beatable, and I really feel we could take them if we see them in the tournament."" Bucknell did not fare as well against Lehigh, who came into the match with a similar record to Bucknell's (3-19). Lehigh came out strong from the opening whistle, as they took advantage of 18 Bucknell serve-reception errors along with 23 attack errors. The Lady Engineers took the match in three straight games 15-7, 15-8, 15-7. Colbert and Forosisky led the Lady Bison attack with six kills each. ""We had a lot of unforced errors against Lehigh,"" commented Opalski. ""We are being aggressive, but we are still making way too many errors at this point in the season."" Last Tuesday Bucknell tried to put its conference problems behind, taking on old East Coast Conference foe Delaware. But the Lady Blue Hens would not give an inch to the Lady Bison, as Dela ware walked all over the hosts 15- 3, 15-5, 15-2. Forosisky continued to prove herself as a dominant player, recording 10 kills in the los ing effort. ""Kara (Forosisky) is a quality player,"" stated Opalski. ""I think she smells the tournament coming and is priming herself for the tourna m ent She has great floor leadership and exemplifies all the characteris tics a volleyball player should be."" Bucknell will go for their fourth win of the season tomorrow at 1 p.m. in Davis gym as they take on Clarion University. After that it will have a week to prepare for the Patriot League Tournament, to be held at Holy Cross. The Lady Bison will be the seventh seed in the tournament, where they will take on the second seed Colgate. Undefeated Army grabbed the top seed and a first round bye. York Athletic Club), a national polo powerhouse located in the Empire State. Returning Bison included all- time scoring leader Scott Schulte '81, Garrin Ka pec lei '89, Truby Voison '89, and Jim Harvey '89. Coach Lynn Kachmarick treasured the chance to play against former teammates, assessing, ""It was great for us."" Kachmarick played her entire squad in an effort to give all her players ample play ing time. ""It was a good break from our long weekends of three to four games,"" she said. Both teams battled in front of a loud homecoming crowd. The alumni edged the current Bison squad 11-9 in a contest that was close the whole way. Schulte led the alumni with five goals, while Kapecki and Voison each scored twice. Kachmarick stressed, ""It's really great for us to have an alumni game, because so many of our graduates are still playing."" After the game, some o f the alumni worked with a couple of the present team members. Their vast polo experience helped and encouraged the younger Bison. This weekend Bucknell, ranked #20 in the nation, travels to Princeton University for the Mid- Atlantic League Championships. Kachmarick foresees ""an extremely competitive weekend."" The key to the Bison's suc cess this weekend will be the abil ity of Bucknell to get physically and mentally prepared for all three games. Bucknell, seeded second in the tournament, looks to be a wor thy contender for the championship title. |l!|!|!f"

Crew teams compete in Schuylkill,"By Kim berly Dobies The Men's and Women's crew teams traveled to Philadelphia this past weekend to compete in the Head of the Schuylkill Regatta. Bucknell had entries in three events: Men's Lightweight Eights, Women's Heavyweight Eights and Men's Heavyweight Eights. The Women's eight, consist ing o f bow Yuko Mera '93, Emily Grill '92, Amanda Kessler '93, Kathy Kolasheski '92, Shelly Pleune '93, Shannon Owens '92, Britta Manskopf '91, stroke Gretchen Maton '92 and Coxswain Robin Stutman '93, raced well and placed 32nd out of 49 teams finish ing ahead of Patriot League rival Lafayette. Among the competition was Ithaca College, which placed first in Boston at the Head o f the Charles. Women's captain Manskopf commented, ""Not having been on the water for almost a week, we were quite happy with our results, especially considering the tough competition in our heat. Water conditions at home on the Susquehanna kept all teams from practicing for over a week before the race. The water level was very high and the current was too strong to enable the boats to be out. ""Water time"" is crucial for blade work and technique. The rowers kept in good condition, however, by participating in strenu ous daily workouts. As a result of the bad water conditions, both men's boats had been off the water for nine days by race time. The lack of water time proved to be a definite weakness for the men's lightweights, who faced the toughest competition of the day. The lightweights consisted of bow J J .  Guiliano '93, Scott Beatty '93, Andy Bush '93, Brian Fetterolf '93, Chris Nome '93, Darryl LaRue "" 93, Edward Williams '93, stroke Steve Kline '93, and coxswain Erin Bums '93 raced against extremely strong lightweight teams such as Princeton, Navy, and Georgetown. Although they rowed well, the lightweights had a disappoint ing finish. When asked to com ment, Bums said, ""Our rating was lower than the competition, but we rowed well considering we had been off the water for nine days."" Results were not available for the men's heavyweight event. According to the men's captain Dave Rhodes '92, ""We had good conditions and we used them to our advantage. Next weekend the men's and women's varsity teams will be joined by five novice boats when they travel to Fairfax, Virginia to compete in the Head of the Occoquan. By Anne Taback Staff Writer The Lady Bison have com pleted their first varsity season with a deceiving 1-7 record. Three of the team's victories were over club teams and that doesn't show up in the standings. However, for a first year varsity team they have come a long way, and on the whole the team and Head Coach Toby Lovecchio are pleased. The Lady Bison ended their season with two games against Lehigh and one game against Lafayette. The first game against the Lehigh Engineers took place in Bethlehem on October 19. Buck nell hit the goal post four times in the first twenty minutes of that game, and according to the coach, outplayed Lehigh the majority of the game. Offensively, Bucknell took 37 shots as opposed to Lehigh's 16. The team just had a hard time scoring. The only goal for the Lady Bison came at 23:35 in the first half, when forward Chris O 'Lare '93 chipped the ball to midfielder Mandy Head '92. Head one-timed the ball, sending a shot into the back of the net from about twelve yards out With only three minutes left in the game, Lehigh tied it up when a foul was called on the Lady Bison from twenty-five yards out. One of the Engineer midfielders took a direct kick which bounced into the box and one of her team mates was there to follow it up for the goal. The game ended in a 1-1 tie. Sweeper Stephanie Porcaro '93 was out of action, so Shannon Smith '92 moved into her position, doing an outstanding job. Genine Streeper '92 moved to stopper and Nicola Stojak '93 came o ff the bench to start the last four games at right back. Smith and Stojak made the adjustment well. The game was summed up well by Lovecchio, ""W e should have won. That became obvious after the next Lehigh game."" Co-captain Dana Esse '91 felt that Lehigh had the same cali ber of talent as the Lady Bison: ""W e were even,"" she said. ""We were on the same level."" In the game against Lehigh Homecoming weekend here at Bucknell, the teams clashed under the lights. After a 1-1 tie in a game that they felt they should have won, the Lady Bison were confident and ready to play. Co-captain Christina Baselga '91 played an outstanding game, tallying both goals of the 2-0 shutout. Her first goal came at 28:56 in the first half, when for ward Amy Krause '91 pushed the ball through the Engineers' defense, and Baselga was there to collect it. She took the shot from about eight yards out, capitalizing on the assist. The second goal came at 39:22, when Baselga took a direct kick from about 25 yards out The ball landed in the upper right hand comer of the net-- ""the goalie never had a chance,"" said Lovecchio. He continued, ""She's been one of the most consistent people on the team this year and it was nice to see her do as well as she did that night."" The conditions for the game were windy and cold, but that didn't stop the Lady Bison defense from playing a great game as well. ""Whenever you shut a team out, it's a good sign,"" said Lovecchio. 'They made no mental mistakes or errors. The offense worked the ball well, a lot of one-touches and good ball movement"" Krause felt that the defenders played well also. ""It was a pretty good game,"" she said. See W OM EN'S SO C C ER , pg. 15 i"

Breakin' Bison take new,
look to the hardwood,"By Chris Drowne Staff Writer When evaluating this year's men's basketball squad it would be easy to consider the Breakin' Bison as a team in its rebuilding stages following the graduation of two first-team all-conference players in Mike Joseph and Greg Leggett. However, this would also be neglecting the nucleus of returning lettermen as well as the new freshmen. Co-captains Keith Fenton '91 and Bill Courtney '92 provide expe rience and leadership at the shoot ing and point guard positions, respectively. Fenton averaged 8.0 points per game off the bench after starting the first seven games last season. Courtney (10.6 ppg, 2.5 apg) started the final 22 games and fin ished among the league's leaders in free throw percentage (.838) and three point shooting (.419). ""I feel much more confident going into this season as opposed to last because I've had a year of experi ence at my position,"" added Court ney. Russell Peyton '93 (16 ppg, 5.3 apg, 3.7 steals pg for the JV team) and Chris Simpson '94 help to make the Bucknell backcourt one of the strongest in the new Patriot League. Forward Mike Bright '93"

Bright started all 29 games last win ter, averaging 10.8 points, 7.1 rebounds, and 1.9 steals per game. The latter two statistics ranked him among the league's best Bright is joined in the front- court by a host of Bison who saw playing time last season. Steve Leshinski '91, Mike Diver '91, and Paul Olkowski '93 shared the cen ter position last season. Leshinski, who finished second in the confer ence in blocked shots with 1.2 per game, started the first 23 games before giving way to Diver in the final six. Olkowski grabbed 4.2 rebounds per game while averaging just over 13 minutes per game. The second forward position will most likely be shared by Pat King '92 and Mike Walsh '92. King led the JV team in scoring (19.1 ppg) and rebounding (11.6 rpg) while shooting .631 from the floor. Walsh played mostly JV last season averaging 12.4 points and 7.8 rebounds per game. Olkowski, Matt Clark '93, and Raymond Brown '94 could also see some time at this position. Tomorrow night at 7:30 in Davis Gym, the Breakin' Bison will take on the Verich Reps in their only pre-season game. The semi- pro team from Ohio does not include any of the same players who won last year's contest 98-92. Admission is free to all students with B.U. I.D., $2 otherwise. The team begins its regular season with the San Juan Shootout November 23-25. Joining the Bison in sunny Puerto Rico will be St. Louis, Old Dominion, Northern Iowa, American University of Puerto Rico, Illinois, and Murray State. Popeye Jones and company from Murray State will play Buck nell in the opening round.

r,"beginning all of the way until the end"" added Courtney. Prior to their Patriot League opener against Holy Cross, the Breakin' Bison will be tested by opponents who have been picked to win their respective conferences such as Yale, Fairfield, and St. Francis (PA). The Patriot League promises to be difficult this season. Lehigh, Holy Cross, Fordham, and Lafay ette will provide Bucknell with its toughest challenges from within the league. ""We met the challenge of our last conference (East Coast Conference), and I don't see any reason why we can't do the same in our new conference,"" commented Coach Woollum after a long prac tice Thursday night. The winner of the Patriot League tournament at Holy Cross March 2-4 will play the winner of the Northeast Conference for the right to go to the NCAA tournament. Last season the vociferous Davis Gym crowd propelled the team to an 11-2 home record. Fen ton believes, ""There isn't a better place to play. It may not be the biggest and most modern facility, but it has the best floor and fan sup port of any place we play. It gives us a definite edge in games, espe cially the close ones."" ""This is one of the youngest teams that we've had here,"" said Coach Woollum. This young team will strive for a more balanced offense. ""Everyone is going to have to contribute offensively. We're not just going to sit around and watch two people (Joseph and Leggett) score 20 a night like we did last year,"" stated Courtney. Fenton added, ""We're more aggressive and feel that we have something to prove to those who picked us near the bottom. We were a little complacent last year after winning the E.C.C. in 1989 and are ready to make a run at the tittle in the Patriot League."" The young, but somewhat experienced team, coupled with strong crowd support could bring the program back to ""The Big Dance"" in March."

Football,"Jonathan Wise/The Bucknellian In the Bison's 28-27 loss to Colgate last Saturday, Matt Walsh '93 carried the ball for a career-high 84 yards."
Women's soccer,"From page 13 ""We knew we could beat them from that 1-1 tie."" Unfortunately the Lady Bison ended their season with a disap pointing loss against Lafayette. According to Lovecchio, Lafayette is a first year varsity team as well, and has the same caliber of talent as the Lady Bison. The game was unbelievably windy but the Lady Bison had their backs to the wind and controlled the first half of the game. Their only goal came at 25:00, when Krause passed the ball to forward Alyssa Meade '94, who took a shot from fifteen yards out. The shot was deflected into the back of the net by one of the Lafay ette defenders. The Lady Bison had a 1-0 lead going into halftime, but about twenty minutes into the sec ond half, Lafayette player Heidi Caruso took a shot from about twenty yards out to score. Goal keeper Kim Fekel '93 made a good attempt at it but the wind was at Caruso's back and she had the advantage. In Lovecchio's opinion, Caruso is one of the better players in the Patriot League. The second goal for Lafayette came on a corner kick when the ball rolled across the middle of the Lady Bison's defense and one of Lafayette's players capi talized on it, taking a shot from five yards out to score. Defensively, the Lady Bison played well in that game. According to Lovecchio, it was the best first half of soccer the team played all year. ""We had some nice opportunities in that game,"" he said. ""Both teams were passing the ball well... we had some really good opportunities, we just failed to capitalize on them."" Goalkeeper Fekel played an outstanding game in net these three games, compiling 38 saves. ""Kim's been solid back there,"" said her coach. ""There's just times when this is going to happen with a team like ours. We're young and we're learning."" Overall, the team is pleased with the progress it has made since the beginning of the season. From Lovecchio's point of view, ""When we started off in the beginning, everything was new for me, for the players... it was a season of transi tion. When we started off as a team, there were things they didn't know and I didn't know and I tried to teach them. I think we improved a lot as the season went on, we're a much better team now."" From page 16 received the ball with 4:27 left on its own 45-yard line. Bucknell drove the entire dis tance, finishing with an eight-yard completion from Hatajik to tight end Jeff Pape '92. Pape ended the day with three receptions for 37 yards, including a 23-yard catch on the play preceding the touchdown. The key play of the drive was an 11-yard completion from Hatajik to Walsh on a fourth-and-four. The touchdown made the score 28-27. Head Coach Maranzana called time out to decide whether Bucknell should go for the tie or attempt the two point conversion for the win. He said, ""We wanted to win the game. We thought we could complete the play, and it was important to us as a football team to get the win."" Higgins echoed Maranzana's decision: ""You have to go for it. It was not a choice. You go for the win at home and for the tie away. He had to go for it."" Hatajik rolled right and lofted"
Men's soccer,"From page 16 Bucknell ends the regular season at 12-4-1, and has tied the school record for most wins in a season. The Bison host the Patriot League playoffs tomorrow as top- seeded Bucknell will face #4 Lafayette at 12 p.m. Bucknell and Lafayette played to 1-1 tie earlier this season. In the second game, second-ranked Fordham plays the third seed Colgate. Colgate defeated the Bison 2-0 earlier this year handing Bucknell it's only a pass for Scocca in the back of the endzone, but it was tipped away, leaving the Bison down by a point. Bucknell was therefore forced to attempt an onside kick with just 55 seconds left to play. The kick was perfect as it took a high bounce in the air, just before reaching the Red Raider front line. The ball was recovered by a leaping Gregg Gcrstmyer '93 on the Colgate 49. But on the next play Hatajik was intercepted, as the pass was deflected into a Colgate defender, who brought the ball back 36 yards to the Bucknell 29- yard line, ending any Bison hope. The interception marked the sixth turnover of the game for the Bison, the most Bucknell has com mitted since its first game this sea son, when it turned the ball over eight times against Hofstra. The Bison's second loss in a row dropped their record to 5-3, 1- 1 in the Patriot League. This week they travel to Holy Cross to take on the Crusaders, who have won their last 21 games at home. Holy Cross in 6-1-1 this year, with a 2-0 record in the Patriot League. They have won their last six games, the most recent a 34-3 stomping of Lafayette. The Crusaders are led on offense by quarterback Tom Ciac- cio and wide receiver Michael Lewis, both of whom were voted to the Colonial League's first team last year. The defense of Holy Cross also features seven returning starters from last year's team that beat Bucknell 35-6 in the Colonial League Championship. Maranzana believes Bucknell will need a great effort in order to win. ""We have to play good foot ball,"" he said. ""We will have to play error-free and inspired because they are a good football team. A win is not out of the realm of possi bilities. We still have a lot of confi dence. We're going to get in their faces because we have not forgotten about the way the pushed us around last year."" Bucknell will try to change history, as the Bison have never beaten Holy Cross in the six times they have played each other. conference loss. The winners of the two semifinal games will play for the league championship on Sunday. ""We're playing at home so everyone will be psyched up to beat us,"" said Mackenzie. ""We've got to play tough this weekend."" 'The key will be to play tough and have no mental errors,"" continued Goodling. ""We'll have to play a complete game and manage to stay within ourselves."" ""We're delighted to be there,"" said Reynolds in regard to the tournament ""Any one of the four teams is capable of putting together the effort that's going to be needed to win it. All of the teams are hungry, and it's going to be a great setting for an exciting collegiate soccer tournament We hope we have a couple of more good games in us, and, as the host school, we would very much like to be in those finals on Sunday."""

Top-seeded Bison prepare to host Lofafayette at 11:30 a.m. tomorrow,"scoring came around."" Bucknell started the second half strong, and managed to score just 2:09 after play resumed. Terry Pelino '91 hit a crossing shot that bounced off Buffalo keeper John Brighton's hands. The rebound came to Dan D'Angelo '92, who knocked it into the empty net to knot the score at 1-1. The Bison kept the pressure on and had several more opportuni ties to score before Mackenzie spearheaded an attack through the Buffalo defense before making a beautiful pass to a streaking Dave Moser '94, who hit a bouncing ball into the lower left comer, giving Bucknell its first lead at 2-1. Buck nell continued to mount more pres sure as play continued, but Buf falo's Brighton played an outstanding game, thwarting the Bison on numerous occasions to keep his team close. It turned out to be a wasted effort, as Bucknell was too strong and held on for the 2-1 victory. ""It was one of the best games we've had this year in terms of put ting it all together."" said Coach Reynolds. ""It was a real good team effort, and not only that but our (full)backs had a lot of poise and good movement. Keith Goodling '92 especially had a super game of moving well and distributing the ball well; he's played solid for us all season."" The Bison took their five- game win streak to Penn State on Tuesday for the last game of the regular season. Penn State con trolled most of the play, but the Bison found themselves up 1-0 when Alex Kogan '94 took a pass from Steve Johnson '91 and beat the keeper to the lower right comer.

After the interception, Colgate drove from its own 41-yard line to score on a eight-yard touch down pass, bringing the score to 21-19 with just over three minutes to play in the third quarter. Bucknell fumbled again for its third straight turnover, this time coming from fumble by Henesey, his second of the game. Hampered by injury, he rushed only nine times for 39 yards. Colgate recovered the ball at its own 43 yard line, and drove the entire distance, scoring on the first play in the fourth quarter on a 16-yard pass play. That made the score 25-21, as the Red Raiders took the lead for the first time. Bucknell got the ball back and was forced to punt the ball after just five plays. Colgate drove 71 yards, culminating with Brown's third field goal of the game, this one from 31 yards out for a 28-21 advantage. Colgate had gained a seven-point lead on 22 consecutive second half points. Higgins attributed part of the turnaround due to the defense being on the field so much in the second half. ""I think we were just a little tired,"" said Higgins. ""It doesn't matter how well you are condi tioned, you are going to get a little tired. If you give a quarterback like Goodwin that many opportunities, with his receivers, he's going to score. You can't hold him forever."" The next possession for the Bison was started with an incom plete pass by Hatajik, who had the wind knocked out of him and went out for a play. On the next play reserve quarterback Jeff Kelly '92 threw an interception at the Buck nell 28-yard line. Colgate advanced the ball to the Bison 15 before Brown attempted a 32-yard field goal, but the kick was blocked. Bucknell finally did make some waves offensively, when it See FOOTBALL, page 15 By Chad Bown Staff Writer With its status in the Patriot League playoffs already deter mined and no more regular-season league contests to play, the men's soccer team has used the last week to make minor adjustments to fine- tune its play for the upcoming championship weekend. Bucknell hosted a tough Buffalo squad last Sunday and traveled to Penn State on Tuesday to take on the Nittany Lions for its final preparation before hosting the inaugural playoffs tomorrow and Sunday. Bucknell took on an out standing University of Buffalo team under cold and windy condi tions last Sunday at East Field. Buffalo entered the game with a 14-1-1 record and a #9 ranking in the latest Division II soccer poll. The Bison had the first opportunity to score as Steve Johnson '91 hit the crossbar with a shot after a flurry in front of the Buffalo net. Buffalo capitalized on its first attempt just 7:34 into the game, when Brian Cribbs lofted a shot into the wind that tricked keeper Scott Racek '91, finding the upper left comer of the net The score put Bucknell behind 1-0, and though the Bison controlled most of the play during the first stanza, they found themselves with a halftime deficit. ""We were a bit worried about the wind because we had it at our backs and couldn't manage to score in the first half."" said Jon Macken zie '93. ""But everything seemed to change in the second half and the Jonathan Wise/The Bucknellian Ken Gulick '91 fires a shot wide of the goal during the Bison's 2-1 victory over Buffalo last Sunday. Gulick leads the 12-4-1 Bison in scoring with nine goals and five assists. By Scott Brown Staff Writer The Bucknell football team suffered a heartbreaking defeat last Saturday to Colgate, as the Red Raiders stormed back from a 21-6 halftime deficit to defeat the Bison 28-27. Bucknell, opting for the chance to win with a two-point con version with :55 remaining in the game, failed on the attempt as quar terback Todd Hatajik's '91 intended pass for wide receiver Dan Scocca '91 fell incomplete. The game marked the third time in the last five years that the annual clash between Colgate and Buck nell has decided by just a single point. It appears the Bison have found a strong football rivalry with the Red Raiders that will be around for many years in the future. Bucknell started strong, led by the play of its special teams. On Colgate's first possession, Blaine Fawcett '93 blocked a punt and Bill Hig gins '91 recov ered the ball, and to it all the way back to give the Bison the early 7- Olead. Higgins commented, ""It was a designed play. Eric Jantzi ('91) took on the tight end, and Blaine, who is one of the fastest guys on the team, came up to make the block. I was just lucky to be there."" Colgate drove 65 yards on its next possession to the Bucknell two-yard line before Tom Norton fumbled the ball. Roosevelt Smith '92 came up with the recovery, but on the following play Brian Hene sey '92, who was playing the game with a back injury, fumbled the ball right back to the Red Raiders. Col gate, however, could not capitalize on the turnover, and its 25-yard field goal was unsuccessful. The Bison defense played remarkably with crucial goal-line stands on Colgate's first two possessions. Bucknell took the ball and drove 80 yards on 13 plays, culmi nating on a three-yard pass play from Todd Hatajik '91 to Tom Mar tin '92 for the score. It was Martin's first career touchdown pass. The drive was highlighted by runs of 14 yards by Matt Walsh '93, and 10 yards by Craig Cavlovic '91. Walsh, filling in for the injured Henesey who played sparingly, fin ished the day rushing for 84 yards on 18 carries, both career highs. The key play of the drive was a 21- yard completion from Hatajik to Dan Scocca '91 of 21 yards on third-and-four. Scocca led the Laura Lands! edel/The Bucknellian Strong safety Mike Cramton '91 lays a hit on this Red Raider receiver last Saturday. Bucknell fell to Colgate 28-27.

The Red Raiders drove 53 yards in 13 plays before settling for a 28-yard field goal by Rick Brown to bring the score to 14-3. The drive featured impressive passing by Dave Good win, who on the drive tossed for 58 yards, including an 18-yarder and a 14-yard completion, each coming on third down. Bucknell bounced right back and scored on its next possession. The Bison marched 60 yards in 10 plays, led by big plays from Hatajik and Cavlovic. The drive ended with a one-yard touchdown run up the middle by Cavlovic. That made the score 21-3 with 5:21 left to play in the first half. Colgate brought the halftime score to 21-6 as Brown hit his sec ond field goal of the game, a 20- yarder as time ran out in the half. The drive, which started at Col gate's own 18 with less than three minutes to play, featured 11 passes from Goodwin, eight which were completed for 69 yards. At halftime the statistics weighed heavily on Colgate's side, yet they still trailed by 15 points. But the tide began to turn as the Red Raid ers began to capi talize on Buck- nell's carelessness. Colgate began their assault on the Bison lead with its first pos session of the second half. It drove 59 yards in nine plays, fin ishing with a three-yard sweep by Steve Wil liams. The touch down was set up by two connec tions from Goodwin to George Delaney, each for 32 yards. Dela ney finished the day with eight catches for 172 yards. Colgate attempted the two point conversion to bring the score within a touch down but was unsuccessful.

PA,"17837 November 2, 1990 Alison Zodraga/The Bucknellian John Dunlop, dean of students, addresses student body at an Open Forum held Tuesday. President Sojka and Vince DeCerchio, director of security and safety, also addressed student concerns."
Sojka holds open forum to,
address student concerns,"By Tara Gilligan Staff Writer Responding to the near riot which occured at a Seventh St. block party on Oct. 31, administra tors spoke to students about the alcohol policy during an open forum on Nov. 6. Hundreds of stu dents packed into the Vaughn Lit. Auditorium to hear President Gary Sojka; John Dunlop, dean of stu dent life; and Vince DeCerchio, director of security and safety; dis cuss the university's attitude toward the alcohol policy and Act 31. 'This is clearly an extension of the conversation that was going on Wednesday night,"" said Sojka, who answered students' questions after they returned to campus last Wednesday. Sojka spoke of the forum as a continuation of the discussion which followed Wednesday night's events. The panel of administrators fielded students questions and emphasized the need for students and administrators to devise a fair policy while still complying with Pennsylvania law. Each of the administrators made an opening statement and stu dents were able to see where DeCerchio, recently hired, stands on several issues. DeCerchio said in his open ing statement, that ""most impor tantly it's important for the students to know that I am a supporter of student rights."" ""My approach is basically that I'm always available to meet with you as a group or as individu als and to discuss your problems, our differences"" regarding the alco hol policy, he said. DeCercio said that the university is establishing a student security advisory board ""to hear grievances and to review poli cies and procedures."" The commit tee will ""reexamine policy guide lines and implimentations,"" he said. Once Sojka opened discussion to the assembly, several students sug gested that students traveled to an off-campus party because the uni versity does not allow groups on campus to host registered parties during the week. When asked by one student if the university would consider allowing mid-week par ties, Dunlop responded, saying, ""The answer unfortunatctly, at this point, is no, you cannot have mid week functions with alcohol. How ever, we can have other kinds of things during the week; you just can't have alcohol."" Another student expressed his concern that security has been too strict in recent months. But with a new emphasis on increased student responsibility, Dunlop said, ""We want to give you an opportu nity ... to show us that we don't need to worry about that night anymore."" DeCercio said that security would not be continuing Wednes day night checks as in the past. Additionally, security will handle weekend parties in a different man- See FORUM, page 7"
Fees to increase 6.93%;,
Faculty discusses near riot,"By Natalie Dunlap Staff Writer A 6.93% increase in the com prehensive fee, which would increase the com prehensive fee from $18,625 to $19,915, was dis cussed at Mon day's faculty meeting. In addi tion, the faculty discussed a rec ommendation to reduce the faculty to student ratio by adding 25 additional faculty members over the next five years, and President Sojka addressed questions dealing with the adminis trations handling of last week's near riot. Economics Professor Michael Moohr, head of the Faculty Commit tee on Planning and Budget, pre sented the recom mended increases in the comprehen sive fee for the 1991-92 aca demic year. The following changes were recommended by the commit tee: Tuition to increase by $1,100 (7.48%) from $14,700 to $15,800; room to increase by $100 (5.00%) from $2,000 to $2,100; and board nell ranks number 20 in terms of comprehensive fees and is $1300 below the average. He defended the increase, by pointing out that the student body is expected to decrease at a rate of 1% per year over the next five years. Moohr also discussed a pro posal to create 25 additional faculty positions. The current student to faculty ratio is 14.1:1 which is the highest of the frame of reference schools. These additional faculty members would substantially lower the student to faculty ratio, making it approximately 12.5:1. Moohr cited additional reasons for the increase in faculty being that some classes are too large now and that some classes are not even being offered in certain departmnets. Another option that he would like to see take place would be to use one-third of these new faculty positions to offer more freshman and senior seminars. See FACULTY, page 2 to increase by $90 (4.93%) from $1,825 to $1,915.

BIO plans to disband due,
to lack of BSG funding,"By Tommy Abel Staff Writer ""Bucknell International Organization (BIO) has plans to disassemble because we have no money,"" Bill Lee, president of BIO, announced three weeks ago at a"
BSG,"appropriations committee meeting. BIO has grown from 70 to 250 members in the past year, yet the money that they received from BSG appropriations went down from $2840 last year to $1935 this year. According to Dave Skena '92, president of BSG, the reason that BIO, as well as several other groups have received less funding is that ""we have more groups and each group is requesting more money."" Skena contends that the BSG has funds to give out only 64% of the money requested. This leaves several student groups in a precarious position. According to Bill Lee, BIO has no reason to exist if it can not get more BSG funding. ""Out of the seven events we have each year, we were appropriated for one event. This event that we were appropriated for was in April which means we can't do anything from now until the time of the event"" With BIO financially dead, Lee and his 250 members are ""basically in limbo because we don't know if we should disassociate and form a committee to take care of that one event."" Lee is especially distressed that his group did not receive the $4254.16 that it asked for because ""we have 250 members on campus and most of the members are not involved in any other organiza tion."" Lee noted that all students contribute a $100 activities fee to fund student organizations and many BIO members who do not belong to other organizations aren't getting their monies' worth. Lee said, ""BIO was origi nally formed to provide a social life for international students. We make sure social events are pro vided so that international students can integrate with American stu dents. With only two social events a year, this is impossible."" Lee explained that the univer sity seems to be contradicting itself. On the one hand, according to Lee, the university advertises its attempts at diversity, but on the other hand it fails to adequately fund diverse organizations. ""I'm confused because the university advertises Bucknell as being very diverse, and it stresses its interna tional aspects, but on the other hand they seem to be pushing us out of existence."" Scott Searle, BSG treasurer, believes that student organizations should not receive preferential treat ment because of the ethnic makeup of its membership. According to Searle, ""He [Lee] is asking the appropriations committee to treat his organization based solely on its ethnic makeup...."" Skena extended on this idea and explained that the financial bur- See BUDGET, page 5"

The stu dent, whose iden tity is not being revealed due to the nature of the case, was jogging on River Road at approximately 3:55 p.m. Wednesday when she was approached by a 20 to 25 year-old man. According to the Depart ment of Security and Safety, the man ""spoke to her, placed his arms around her and threw her to the ground."" The student screamed, ran away from her assailant and reported the inci dent to the Department of The individual sketched above is being sought in connection with a Courtesy of the Department of Security and Safety Security and Safety. The assai lant fled the scene in an older model light green Chevrolet sedan with rust spots.

At the time of the incident Wednesday, the assailant was described as wearing a white shirt and dirty jeans. The Department of Security and Safety issued a ""Crime Alert"" Thursday to inform students of the incidents. Over three hundred fly ers were posted around campus last night. According to Vince DeCer chio, director of security and safety, two other incidents have occurred this week. One attack only hours before this most recent incident, and the other occurred on November 5. The November 5 incident also occurred during daylight hours on River Road.

The student immediately reported the incident to the Department of Security and Safety. According to DeCerchio, Security made an immediate ""sweep of the campus"" on Wednesday looking for a vehicle matching that description. No sus- pects were found. In an interview yesterday, DeCerchio said that ""students should refrain from jogging in iso lated places off campus."" He contin ued, ""There are ample places in well lighted and well populated areas for students to jog. If it is neces sary to jog in these areas,"" DeCerchio con tinued, ""students should jog in pairs."" In response to these most recent incidents, DeCerchio said, ""I have asked [my officers] to increase the fre quency of patrols up and down that [River] road. Periodically"

DeCerchio added that the Department of Security and Safety, in cooper ation with the East Buffalo Police Department, is currently checking campus for a vehicle and individual that match descriptions given by the students who have been assaulted.

Faculty -,"From page 1 Professor David Ray pre sided over this meeting in the L.C. Forum, which opened with Presi dent Sojka answering questions from the group. The majority of the questions asked of Sojka concerned the events leading upto the near riot on the night of Halloween. Professor John Cooper of the chemistry department, in particular, had many questions for the Presi dent about why no ""disciplinary action"" was taken that night in ""the face of obvious violation."" Cooper said, ""There were open drinking violations, peace was definitely disturbed, and people's property was infringed upon."" He wondered what kind of a message such a han- dling of the incident gave to the community, especially when, as he pointed out, a similar incident occurred that same night at Susque hanna, but disciplinary action was taken and arrests were made there. Cooper also wanted to know what President Sojka said to the police when he intervened and what responsibility the university had for the cost of gathering such a large group of police and other reinforcements. President Sojka responded to Cooper by explaining that his ""principal goal"" as he viewed the situation that night was ""getting out of there without anyone getting hurt"" President Sojka's prime objective was to get ""the students off the street without any violence."""

Joe Clark to lecture,
m,
!#H ip f,"Courtesy of Public Relations Joe Clark, the former principal at Eastside High in Patterson, New Jersey upon whom the movie Lean On Me was based, will speak about his experiences and the future of American educa tion on November 14 in the Weis Center at 8pm. Think you've got it bad here at Bucknell? At Eastside High in Patterson, New Jersey, there was a stabbing on the first day of school in September 1981. The school was plagued by drug deal ers and delinquents, but when Joe Clark began his tenure as principal of Eastside High things changed dramatically. Clark started by expelling three hundred students and quickly turned Eastside High into a model school. For his efforts, Clark was named one of the nation's 10 ""Principals of Leadership"" in 1986. The incredible story of Joe Clark and Eastside High was made into the hit movie Lean On Me starring Oscar-nominee Morgan Freeman. On Wednesday, Joe Clark will share his experiences and views about the future of education in America with the Bucknell community. Clark has appeared on the cover of Time magazine and has been profiled on 60 Minutes, Nightline, and Donahue. President Rea gan praised Clark's accomplishments and commended him on the tough leadership that turned one of the worst urban schools into one of the outstanding schools in the state of New Jersey. Today Clark holds the position of Assistant Superintendent of Schools and continues to stress the ideals of discipline in educa tion and the importance of school pride. The lecture, entitled ""From Disgrace to Amazing Grace"" will take place on Wednes day, November 14 in the Weis Center at 8 pm. There will be a reception following the lecture in the Center Gallery. In addition, the movie Lean On Me will be shown in the Langone Center Forum tomorrow and on Monday."
History Curriculum expanded to,
include race/class/gender studies,"By Lisa Hirschkorn Staff Writer ""The history department is utterly committed to race, class and gender,"" said Mary A. Hill, profes sor and chair of history. A recent curricular change affirms Hill's thoughts; that is, the requirement that incoming history majors take one course in race, class, or gender. ""I think the history of the his tory department has been a disad vantage and an advantage to us,"" Hill said. She explained ""A lot of students come to us and say, 'why don't you teach more traditional courses.' We've hired a number of people with specialties that we think of as 'service courses' to the university ------ African History, African-American History and our own studies of courses. The result is that we haven't got as many courses in what people think of as traditional history."" ""The advantage, though, is that I think we have made an important contribution to the Uni versity. We've given sequence courses in Afro-American History, in women's history and in environ mental concerns, which is a key issue right now. We can't make the rules retroactively but the require ment for incoming freshmen his tory majors is that they must take at last one course in these concentrations."" Yet, changes within the his tory department constitute only a small part of a complex debate. This debate ensues within the Eng lish department, where proposals to alter Buckncll's curriculum arc pending. Whereas the revised his tory major will be effected next fall, the English major will not be formally changed until fall 1993. This debate has also prompted the University's rethinking of the dis tribution requirements within the College of Arts and Sciences. ""We've just gone through discussion of a new program for English majors,"" said Robert Tay lor, professor and chair of English. Taylor explained that the English Department intends ""to open up the curriculum with courses of non- canonical nature ------ for example, by bringing courses on women writers and minority writers into the mainstream of the curriculum."" Responding to a ""Cultural Revisionism,"" Taylor said the Eng lish Department debated whether to require courses ------ on minority studies ex' women's literature or lit erary theory ------ that were not rep resented in the curriculum. Taylor said, ""By requiring one course in one of those areas, we'd be saying 'these are important, we urge you to take note of them.' We decided instead to put the courses on an equivalent basis.. .within the text of Renaissance, and the eighteenth, nineteenth and twentieth centuries). Under the new system, ""courses in British literature, American litera ture, women's literature and Afri can-American literature, and liter ary theory can fulfill this requirement"" Secondly, the English Department is proposing a ""Prosem inar"" in literary studies. The Pro- seminar will link three writers from different historical periods and should be taken by majors in their Ashley Chertkof/The Bucknellian Mary Hill, chair and professor of history, will be responsible for insti tuting the first ever race/class/gender distributional requirement for history majors. the curriculum...it's a more demo cratic way."" Examining the department's past, Taylor said 'Truthfully, the way it was structured viewed litera ture as ending in 1930, and mod ernist writers ended with Joyce....The exclusion of women and minority writers happened given the conditions of the time...writers didn't get attention and this was perpetuated by our times."" The English Department's two-fold proposal has yet to be approved by Eugenia Gerdes, dean of arts and sciences. First, the pro posal entails changing the course requirements for the five historical periods(The Middle Ages, The junior year. The idea of a foundations seminar, however, is not exclusive to departmental curriculums alone, and could possibly be incorporated into the B.A. distributional require ments within the College of Arts and Sciences. Since 1970, the present distribution requirements have been in place. Any future cur riculum changes rest with the deans and the General Education Council. The distributional require ments are ""a terribly unsatisfactory answer,"" according to John Ken drick, Professor of Sociology. Ken drick sits on the General Education Council, and explained that they are trying to find ""some way to deal with the distribution requirements."""
Faculty debate plans for incinerator,"By Bob Ritter Staff Writer Plans to mobilize opposition to the hazardous waste incinerator proposed in Gregg Township con tinued to move forward Wednesday night, with an organizational meet ing for the Organization United for Ecology's (OUE) activities in the Lewisburg area. The meeting brought between 70 and 80 inter ested campus and local citizens to Dana Engineering's Gardner Lec ture Hall to hear a number of speakers, including State Rep. Russ Fairchild, address the range of safety concerns about the project. Fairchild, one of the many local elected officials who have united against the project, addressed the political process involved in stopping the incinera tor's construction. Fairchild explained that between one and three hazardous waste incinerators are recommended by the Common wealth of Pennsylvania's federally- mandated plan for hazardous waste disposal, but that the state ""will have problems selling the concept of putting this facility in anyone's backyard."" He said that recycling such materials should also be an important component of eliminat ing hazardous waste, but that ""we may never get to zero; however, that doesn't mean we keep going with a policy I don't think is going to get us anyplace."" Fairchild said which, according to Fairchild, has not been clearly defined. He said that, in order to stop the incinerator, ""we have to prove the system, as it exists now, will not work. Can we stop this thing? I think we can."" Dr. George Miller, a local obstetrician active in the American Proposed USPCI Facility at the Susquehanna Industrial Park Allenwood, PA (Aerial view: looking north) Couresy of USPCI The incinerator sketched above has been furiously debated by faculty and residents who live near the proposed site. that one of the major problems with Academy of Environmental Medi- the hazardous waste plan is ""the cine, explained the health risks of ability of the government to usurp the incinerator. He said, 'There is a local authority"" in the areas of zon- [USPCI] VP sitting their with their ing and land use planning, as long checkbook, waiting for DER to say as the developer, in this case 'go,' and they will write the check USPCI, goes through a ""meaning- and the building will go up. [The ful public participation process"" key is] looking for the political per son who will press the button, who will say that this site is unsafe, and Union Pacific will close their checkbook."" Miller also noted that ""much information is lacking on this chemical waste disposal plant"" Fairchild also attacked the information process, saying ""the rules and regs are geared to technical issues; there are a lot more issues. DER [The Department of Environmental Resources] in this state does not have the best reputation. They are also undermanned and underbudgeted."" Noting safety concerns, Miller con cluded, ""Obviously, the prior ity given by government is to industry, and not to the local population."" Charles Sackrey, asso ciate professor of economics, was one of about half a dozen faculty and local people who initiated the meeting to orga nize the Lewisburg chapter of OUE. He said, 'The goal between now and Christmas is to get the membership list as large as possible, and in the new year to develop new strategies. The principle way these things are stopped is politically."" Sackrey said the goal is to sign up 2,000 mem bers in the Lewisburg area, as part of a overall strategy to enlist 10.000 members in OUE. ""If you establish the fact that you've got 10.000 people opposed to the incin erator,"" Sackrey explained, ""that's a political reality. The long run effort will be to bring enough pres sure on the politicians that they will deny the permit"" for the facility. He said there is ""something fundamen tally wrong"" with the political pro cess in which one DER official will make the final decision, saying ""politically it's undemocratic."" Sackrey explained the key to stop ping the process is to show ""they're up against a determined group of citizens."" Plans to construct the inciner ator were announced in September by USPCI, Inc., a Houston-based subsidiary of the Union Pacific Corporation. The $100 million haz ardous waste incinerator is planned for a 400-acre site the company purchased from a developer in Gregg Township, near the village of Allenwood in northern Union County. Company officials faced stiff opposition in their first public informational meeting, which drew national media attention. Kendrick explained, ""Each depart ment controls its own courses within the overall say of the curriculum committee."" The curriculum com mittee appoints the members of the General Education Council. The Council is composed of two stu dents or faculty from the sciences, the social sciences, and the Student Government. A representative of the writing center, a representative of the Racc/Gender Center, and Dean Gerdes make up this Council. ""In the future, all students coming into the curriculum will be guaranteed a fifteen-person seminar in their first year,"" Kendrick said. ""We're trying to be sensitive to over 1000 students who said they wanted courses like these [referring to a petition signed last spring where stu dents demanded more courses con cerning race, class, and gender]. According to Kendrick, ""The notion that we have to include women's works and African-American authors is a way to include cultural works that have sort of dropped out of history--they've been forgotten. We haven't restructured the curricu lum to reflect that we're rethinking goals of higher education -- we've simply not done that."" ""Evidently, the student body wants race, class and gender courses,"" said Adrienne Jones, Director of Multiculture Programs. Jones added ""the courses are at least offered but I think at least one dis tributional requirement should be non-western...In order to matriculate through the University, students must take a non-Westem course."" Intellectual debate about the curriculum's focus continues. According to Karen Dugger, Co- Director of the Race and Gender Resource Center, ""teaching students from an inclusive perspec tive...having a curriculum that is inclusive is all the rage right now. As of yet there's no requirement anywhere in the University other than in the History Department, anfif it's possible for students to go uned ucated about race, class, and gendef. A number of our frame of reference schools and liberal arts colleges -- Colgate, and Dennison, for instance-- already have these requirements."" Jones said ""When I came to Bucknell, I had to make up for eighteen years of education I never had. Maybe the University wants the students to have a choice. Yet, in order to complete a well-rounded education, sometimes it means these courses must be mandatory. If you're not inclusive of all people-- like women who make up one-half on the society--how are you going to get back to the core? Exclusion allows for all the -isms to occur."" The exclusion of certain groups, according to Dugger, is heightened by the increasing demo graphic shift within the college pop ulation. ""What's predictable and sad is that this rage is occuring while the white population is in a decline and when it's in self-interest to start being concerned about diver sity."" The population increase of non-whites between the ages of 18 and 22, has caused ""majority group students to decline and minority group students to increase in terms of their presence within educational institutions."" According to Timothy Clark, Acting Director of Minority Student Development, ""the number of stu dents going to college is dropping and more and more pepple of color, Hispanics and Asians arc starting to fill those slots. More and more peo ple form different cultures arc living together. Clark added, ""Bucknell is trying to gear itself to unite the community."" Editor's Note: This is part one of a two-part series focusing on the the University's Arts and Sciences curriculum."

US and Saudis,
discuss military,"Following talks between Sec retary of State James Baker and Saudi King Fahd Monday, the United States and Saudi Arabia have agreed on a unified military command structure in the event of an Iraqi attack. Baker and Fahd said that an offensive attack against Iraqi troops in Kuwait or Iraq would only occur if both President Bush and the king agreed before the attack began. The meeting between the sec retary and the king reflected the continued cooperation between the Americans and Saudis, as well as their desire to keep options open in confronting Iraq during their occu pation of Kuwait."
Iraq to release,
78 Japanese,"Iraq announced Tuesday that it would release 78 of the 305 Japa nese hostages held since the inva sion of Kuwait. The release was to reward former prime minister Yasuhiro Nakasone for his visit and negotiations with Iraqi leader Sad dam Hussein. The Nakasone visit reflects a trend of pilgrimages to Baghdad by prominent politicians from nations allied against Iraq. The visits began with Austrian president Kurt Wald heim, after which 70 Austrian hos tages were released. European leaders have stre- nously opposed these visits. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Brit ain objected to former Prime Minis ter Edward Heath's visit to Bagh dad in mid-October. Iraq released 40 British hostages to Heath. For mer West German Chancellor Willy Brandt arrived in Iraq this week following strong denuncia tions from the foreign ministers of the European Economic Commu nity. The ministers are meeting in Rome to discuss the issue. ing the compounds and at least one official spoke of several military options available to the United States, administration officials say that maintaining the embargo against Iraq was more important than keeping the embassies open. A State Department official said that a failed attempt to resup ply the embassies could hand more hostages to Iraq and provoke an attack on allied positions in Saudi Arabia by Iraq."

US ponders new,
immigrant plan,"A new immigration measure may become law, the first major change in American immigration policy in 25 years. The measure would increase the number of for eign professionals allowed into the country. The plan would nearly triple the number of immigrants allowed into the United States, from 55,000 to 140,000 per year. The numbers of total immigrant would rise from 500,000 to 700,000 allowed to enter each year. The framework maintains the current emphasis on reunification of families, while raising quotas for European and African immigrants. Regulations would be relaxed that hamper or bar Communists, AIDS patients, and homosexuals from immigrating. Businesses, universities, and research institutions have sup ported the plan, because of a fear that America may fall behind in the numbers of professionals needed to keep businesses competitive and research facilities operating. Some minority groups have spoken against the bill by saying that America should develop the profes sional talents of the citizens we have now."
S&Ls attem pt to,
evade Fed. laws,"Savings and loans across the nation are trying to get state laws passed that would allow them to convert into savings banks. Federal regulators say this is an attempt to evade strict new federal guidelines, while the institutions charge that the new laws are so onerous that they cannot do business under them. ""These efforts are blatant attempts to evade the reforms enacted by Congress,"" said Timo thy Ryan, director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, which regulates savings and loans. ""I am greatly disturbed by the growing phenome non of S & L's attempting to cir cumvent the requirements of Con gress simply by changing the form of their charter to become state sav ings banks."" Ryan said he fears that switching from a savings and loan charter to a state savings bank char ter will give institutions the same freedoms that lead to the Federal bailout of the savings and loan industry."
Republicans,
minimize losses,"Dispite fears by incumbants that angry voters would return many officials to private life, few incumbants were defeated follow ing the elections held Tuesday. Republican fears that they faced large Democratic gains in gov ernor's seats and Congressional posts were also calmed as losses were ncpi ai icveis cummon during mid-term elections. In Florida, Governor Bob Martinez was defeated by former Democratic Senator Lawton Chiles, who portrayed himself as a political outsider and limited all contributions to $100 per person. Anne Richards, behind in the polls for most of the campaign, defeated businessman and rancher Clayton Williams in the Texas gubertorial race. Williams, the Republican can didate, made statements throughout the campaign that hurt him among women and alienated many voters. In both these races. President Bush campaigned heavily for the Repub lican candidates. Republicans held onto California, as their candidate, Senator Pete Wilson, defeated for mer San Francisco mayor Dianne Feins tein. In Congressional races, North Carol ia Senator Jesse Helms defeated Harvey Gantt Gantt a black liberal Democrat showed surprising strength in pre-election polls, forcing Helms to stoop to air ing campaign commercials that explicitly dealt with race. Two sur prises were the weak victories of Democratic Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey and Representative Newt Ginrich of Georgia. Both leading members of Congress were expected to easily win reelection, yet both won narrow victories. Political analysts say that this weak showing for Bradley, mentioned as a leading Democratic candidate for the party's 1992 presidential cam paign, may hurt his chances for national office."
Incinerator dis,
cussion offered,"Clyde Peeling, owner of Rep- tileland and representative of Organizations United for the Envi ronment, and Anthony Donatoni, president of United States Pollution Control Industries (USPCI) of Pennsylvania, will discuss ""Two Perspectives on the Proposed Incin erator"" Tuesday, November 20, at 7 p.m. in Vaughan Literature Auditorium. The discussion is the second in a series examining the hazardous waste incinerator proposed for Gregg Township. The discussion, which will be followed by a question and answer period, is open to the public."

Univ. pays $1.5,
mil settlement,"Marquette University has agreed to an out-of-court settlement of $1.5 million with a former uni versity cheerleader who had filed a lawsuit after he broke his neck while performing at a basketball game. Joseph de Guzman, the for mer cheerleader, fell on his neck during a 1983 stunt in which he tried to dive over other cheerlead ers and land on a mat. In his law suit filed inl986, de Guzman charged that the university had been negligent in employing a cheerleading coach that was unqualified to judge the safety of routines he asked cheerleaders to perform. The trial was scheduled to begin this week. The university, in a written statement, defended its cheerlead ing program by saying the accident ""involved unfortunate circum stances rather than negligence."" The statement also said that the decision to settle out-of-court was company ""recognized that a pro tracted jury trial would not serve anyone's best interest."""
Stanford alters,
couples policy,"Stanford University has extended access to campus housing and other privilidges now enjoyed by married students to unmarried couples - homosexual as well as heterosexual. The new policy states that unmarried couples will be eligible for campus apartments if they are an ""established, long-term domestic partnership with a mutual commit ment similar to that of marriage."" Non-student spouses of stu dents are issued courtesy cards granting them access to medical benefits, libraries, and athletic and recreational facilities. Before the policy change, non-student part ners, other than spouses, have been awarded such privileges on a case- by-case basis. Gay and lesbian students at Stanford have pushed for the change in university policv since 1976."

He explained that ""those checks will not involve going into private rooms or inside into the house."" Security would venture no further than the foyer or living room of a fraternity house, he said. ""I see no reason why you cannot police your own houses and control your own activities,"" DeCerchio said. He explained that unless groups request the help of security or unless the party gets out of control, ""you won't see the type of petty enforcement that you've experienced in the past"" When one student asked whose laws, the university's or the state's, will be followed, Sojka responded by saying that university policy must remain within state law. ""I mentioned and I will con tinue to mention publicly that I think Pennsylvania Act 31 has not improved the lives of college stu dents and I think it has signifi cantly impacted in a not-positive way the lives of the people who live around Pennsylvania col leges,"" Sojka said. The committee which DeCerchio spoke of will work on revising university within the per- ameters of Act 31. ""There's a lati tude for my interpretation and my implementation of policies and pro cedures and I intend to utilize stu dent imput. You will work with me in that process,"" said DeCerchio,"

A number of us were trying to say, in what were not in the best of situations, that maybe much of what was asked had already been taken care of."" He said that the event has riveted everyone's atten tion to an important issue. In addition to fielding more students' questions, the administra tors asked students what steps to follow next. According to Sojka, administrators are willing to work with students to create a reasonable policy, which will still comply with Act 31.

Amarante enjoyed thrills of,
life as NYC detective,
Security and Safety Captain discusses 21 years with NYC police dept.,"By Bob Ritter Staff Writer ""Lewisburg is boring! Noth ing exciting ever happens here!"" This is a common refrain among some Bucknell students; Lewis- burg's tranquility, however, suits Security and Safety Captain Mike Amarante just fine. Amarante, who served 21 years in the New York City Police Department, retired in 1975 as a Detective First Grade and came to Bucknell because ""my time wasn't my own..., my kids were growing up without me [and] we always loved the country."" Since he traded the danger on the streets of his native Brooklyn for the calm of his eight-acre farm in the West Branch valley, Amarante has hardly looked back. While on the force, Amarante never had to look back, because he always seemed to be a step ahead of the criminals. ""A street crime cop from the beginning,"" Amarante began build ing his reputation in 1954; ""crime went down tremendously"" when he hit the streets as a rookie patrol man, and his 44 rookie arrests earned him promotion to detective after less than two years on the force. Throughout his career, Ama rante made close to 500 robbery arrests, but only had one trial-- everyone else ""pleaded guilty. They were all caught in the act."" Since he left the city, however, life is no safer for muggers and street thiefs, because Amarante helped train the Force's original street crimes unit, which incorporated the methods Amarante and his partner used ""because we were so effective."" It was ""an ability to spot criminals before they do a crime"" that made Amarante a great street cop, but where does such ability come from? While admitting that ""you've got to have a feel, a second nature,"" he said it also was ""a knowledge of the streets, a knowl edge of Brooklyn, and a knowledge of crime."" As a self-described ""tough street kid"" growing up as one of ten children, he ""was street wise already,"" explaining his astounding rookie record. Amarante and his partner would spot a potential criminal and then trail him for anywhere from several minutes to several hours. The key, he says, is ""to try to get close to your prey, but never let them see you; if you have to, be in a disguise."" Amarante would use hats, glasses, blankets and almost anything else to avoid being seen. Just as in many television police shows, that old man walking down the street with a limp might really have been Detective Amarante. How do you face danger on the streets, from any direction at any time, every day for 21 years? Amarante explained, ""You weren't afraid, you were cautious. If you were afraid you were dead. You leant to act and react; you had to be careful and do everything smartly."" The key, he said, is ""always to make sure you have the upper hand, [and] take them without vio lence if possible."" For instance, Amarante explained that, in an armed robbery of a neighborhood store, the first instinct would be to charge in while the crime was in progress, but the smart officer would wait until the criminal entered the street and put his gun away. Looking back on his career, Amarante says he ""thanks God I wasn't killed. I also never killed anyone--I'm proud of that."" Amarante earned 53 depart mental citations and civic awards and letters of commendation from police commissioners, FBI Direc tors and Supreme Court justices, but he continued to face the danger because he ""enjoyed saving people. You felt good about yourself, and it gave you the inspiration to go out again."" One of Amarante's cita tions came when, while off-duty, he pushed his way through on lookers to dash into a burning house and save a baby trapped inside, sustaining bums himself in the process. He especially ""always enjoyed apprehending for mug gings of old people,"" and used to work extra hours to do so ""because you've seen the victims of muggers not caught."" ""Although you do miss being who you were,"" he said, ""you don't miss the brutality you saw, and the crimes against people."" When Amarante left the force he had a year in which he could return to his former job, and he said ""It took me quite a while [deciding] over whether to go back."" In the end, Amarante said, ""It was the students that kept me here."" He feels the key to his good rapport with students is that ""they respected me because I respected them."" During his fifteen years at Bucknell those students have included two of his four children. His daughter Collette graduated in 1988 with an education degree, and his son Greg is currently a fresh man. Over the years he has enjoyed working with students and having his children's friends over to the farm for a home-cooked Italian meal. Amarante especially looks forward to Homecoming and ""see ing most of my students,"" who return as alumni with their own children. (One of those kids is named Michael, for a certain Secur ity officer.) Like many other members of the Bucknell community, he has noticed that it has become more dif ficult to keep a close relationship with students in recent years. Ama rante says, ""You have to try to reach out [to the students] with respect and keep it. You watch over them like you watch over your own children."" Ashley Chertkof/7he Bucknellian Mike Amarante, pictured here with his son, Greg '94, earned 53 department citations and civic awards and numerous letters of com mendation for his outstanding work with the New York City Police Department."
Dear Wanda,"Dear Readers; Here's a little pep talk for everyone trying to snag a for mats date; Formats are a perfect time to let that boxmate or lab partner know that you're interested. If you feel comfortable with the person and receive positive vibes, go for it! You have noth ing to lose, and everything to gain. Most people are really flat tered by an invitation to a date function. An important key to ask ing the right person to formats is to be honest with yourself. Don't ask someone you don't like, just because he or she is in the right Greek organization. Also, don't be pressured by your friends. Remember, it's your date, and you shouldn't base who you ask on who your friends think you should ask. If the thought of rejection mortifies you, find a common friend who can test the ground for you. If you ask the person on your own, make sure you ask in a way that makes the person feel comfortable saying no. If you corner the person into saying 'yes,' the formats will end up being uncomfortable. A good idea is to say, "" If you're not busy o n ____________ (date), I was wondering if you'd like to go to formats with me."" This gives the person an easier oppr- tunity to decline or at least think about it (i.e. "" I have to check my calendar""), and lets you know that the 'yes' answer is sincere. Here are the top ten tips on popping that question: 10. brush and floss for that winning smile 9. add a mild cologne or perfume 8. don't fidget (ie, shuf fling your feet, twirling your hair) 7. use flattery (i.e. "" You are a terrific dancer; I'd love to go with you to formals."") 6. bribery works, too ( i.e. "" Dinner and dessert are included."") 5. white lies (i.e. ""We haven't decided whether our band is going to be Aerosmith or Pink Floyd."") 4. be casual; you're not proposing marriage 3. don't play it too cool, they will think you don't care one way or the other 2. wear fairly neat clothes (not your oldest and grungiest) 1. JUST DO IT - good luck in your quest for the Holy Formals Date, have a blast Dear Wanda, I want to go abroad for a semester but I don't want to leave my boyfriend for that long. Frightened, Confused, and Disillusioned Dear F, C, and D, You may be basing your decision on the wrong factors. Your boyfriend may have tried to convince you not to go abroad. It's nice that he wants to spend time with you, but it is your life. You can't let your life revolve entirely around him; do not give up this fantastic oppor tunity for someone else. You can survive without him for a few months - you can even write to each other every day if you want to. Going abroad is something you have to do for yourself. This may be the only chance you have to live abroad without pay ing extraordinary amounts of money for living expenses. Take advantage of what you are being offered. It is up to you and your boyfriend to decide how to han dle it. You can leave it open to see other people, or just have a temporary long-distance rela tionship. Do not assume that he will fall in love with someone else while you're gone. If you're committed to each other it can work. Send your problems and concerns to: Dear Wanda c/o The Bucknellian Box C-3059."

Rockin' the airwaves on WVBU,"By Sean Grass Staff Writer Located in five main rooms in the depths of the Carnegie Build ing's basement is a campus organi zation that most Bucknellians know of, but who most know little about. This organization is the radio voice of Bucknell University, 90.5"
WVBU FM.,"The radio station functions through the efforts of the approxi mately eighty students who volun teer as disc-jockeys at the station. Eight of these eighty disc-jockeys (or jocks as they prefer to be called) comprise the station's Board of Directors, the group that is responsible for the administrative aspects of the station. These eight positions are laid out in the sta tion's by-laws and constitution. The positions are elected offices, and the term is from January to Jan uary, spanning one semester each of two separate school years. This year's Board of Direc tors consists of the following peo ple; Evan Lippman, '91, Station Manager; Colin Bridgewater, '92, Program Director; John Devecka, '91, Music Director; Gene Toombs, '92, Business Manager; Toby Basi- liko, '91, Chief Engineer, and Matt Wood, '92, Operations Manager. The other two board positions, those of Sales Director and Senior Advisor, are vacant at this time. Also involved in the manage ment of WVBU is a group of six persons known as the Support Staff. Only one of the positons on this staff is filled at this time-- Craig Bitter, '93, is currently the Promotions Manager. The Faculty Advisor for the station is Catherine Blair of the Writing Center. So now you know who runs the station, but how does WVBU really operate? At the beginning of each semester, a meeting is held for all jocks at WVBU. This meeting is to allow each jock to select the day and time for his or her show for that semester. The shows run on a weekly basis and run in length from 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 hours. The jocks pick in order of their seniority in work ing with the station. Because of this, freshmen normally get the worst shifts, but the system looks increasingly more equitable as you gain seniority with the station. This meeting to determine ""show picks"" is normally held within the first three weeks of the semester. Of course, not just anyone can get a show on WVBU--at least not right away. People who are interested in becoming a disc- jockey must go through a series of training steps in order to become qualified for a shift on the air. A prospective jock must first display knowledge of how to operate the bewildering array of buttons, knobs, and switches on the control room board in the studio by passing a practical board exam. Then the prospective jock must make an audition tape, or a ""demo,"" simulat ing an hour-long show on the air. Once this tape is approved by the Board, the prospective jock will be WVBU range from jazz to reggae to hard rock. Currently, though, the shows on WVBU are mainly split up between classic rock and pro gressive music. Specialty shows, such as Heavy Metal, Sounds of the City, and Bucknell Top 10 can also be found in various time slots throughout the week. The station also airs a special Prisoner Request show in which requests arc taken in letter form from inmates at the Lewisburg Penitentiary. What is it that allows for such a diversity of music to be found on WVBU? Undoubtedly it is the enormous collection of records. The station has an entire room that is devoted to the storage of albums, as well as some forty-five's. Some ;oq Peter Ho/The Bucknellian Bill Post '92 DJ's classic rock live from WVBU's radio station in the basement of Carnegie Hall. asked to sit in on three shows that are run by a Board member, as an observation experience. After that there is nothing left to do but apply to the Federal Communications Commission for a radio operator's license. The new jock is ready to start rocking the airwaves. One unusual feature of WVBU is that jocks are permitted to choose the kind of music they would like to play during their shift. For this reason, shows on of these date back to as many as twenty years. According to Greg Williams, '92, a former Sales Director with the station, ""a quick estimate"" of the number of albums in the music library gave him a count of ""about 20,000 albums."" These albums have been accumulating since the forming of the station back in 1965, and more come all of the time from groups to which WVBU subscribes for new music. Additionally, WVBU now has two compact disc players--one has been bought in each of the past two years. Along with these CD- players, the station receives com pact discs in much the same way as it receives albums, through sub scriptions. In the year since WVBU acquired its first CD player, the star lion has ""upwards of 200, maybe 300 discs,"" Williams said. The purchasing of all of these new discs and albums requires money, however, and the station is run as a non-profit organization. WVBU does very little advertising, with the exception of its fund raising Spring Marathon Weekend, normally held in May. The station also sends jocks to do remotes at dances and parties, and Williams said that ""this does pull in quite a few bucks."" Also, subscribing to groups for new music helps to keep costs low; the station rarely buys new music outright. Nevertheless, the fact remains that costs are numerous, and WVBU's only large source of funding is the Bucknell Student Government Each year,"
BSG,"appropriates money to the radio sta tion to keep it going. ""In ball park figures,"" accord ing to Williams, ""the station got $18,000 last year."" He added that the station expects around $14,400 this year, a considerably smaller allotment The funds, while seeming large for a station run by volun teers, are nevertheless chewed up quickly. The F.C.C. requires that WVBU subscribe to the Associated Press news wire. The fee for the service is $5200 annually, nearly one-third of the station's funding. WVBU also receives such music publications as Rolling Stone and the College Music Journal. Add to these costs those of maintenance, new equipment, and new music, and it is obvious where the funding for the station vanishes. Even so, WVBU is celebrat ing its twenty-fifth anniversary this year. The station keeps churning day after day, rocking the Lewis burg area at a frequency of 90.5 mega-hertz under the call letters WVBU. With its musical diversity as well as the commitment of the students who volunteer to work there year in and year out, the sta tion should continue to last for a long long time."
How does Bucknell stack up,
in the college guide books?,"By Susan Elolampi Staff Writer Rumors have been circulating around campus that Bucknell is fall ing in the college ratings game. These seem to have started after the release of The U.S. News and World Report ""College Guide"" for 1991 (October 15, 1990) which rated Bucknell in the top quartile for National Liberal Arts Colleges. Bucknell was not mentioned in The U.S. News and World Report ""Col lege Guide"" for 1990. And Buck nell was rated as number 24 in the top 25 National Liberal Arts Col leges in the previous year's issue, October 10,1988. However, in some of the col lege guides, such as The Insider's Guide to Colleges, compiled and edited by the staff of The Yale Daily News, and The Fiske Guide to Colleges by Edward B. Fiske, Edu cation Columnist for The New York Times, Bucknell's rating has remained constant for the last few years. For example, in The Fiske Guide to Colleges for both 1989 and 1991, academics and social life continue to have a four out of five star rating and the quality of life continues to have a three star rating (five stars representing the best level). It seems, though, that where the concern has come is where Bucknell was rated as ""highly competitve"" or ""very difficult"" in 1989. But, in some of the 1991 col lege guides such as Peterson's Four Year Colleges guide, Bucknell is listed as being ""very difficult"" or ""very competitive."" Director of Admissions Mark Davies points out that the catego ries in the rating system, especially those of U.S. News and World Report, change every year. ""Buck- nell's basis for choosing possible candidates has remained the same."" ""Profiles for classes of the last ten years show that the kind of student we're admitting to Bucknell hasn't changed,"" he explains. ""I don't think our competitors' pro files have changed either so that they are dealing with the same qual ity students that we are."" He also points out that col leges are looking at smaller num bers of high school seniors in the next few years so that will leave more opportunities for graduating high school students that are not currently available to them. How ever, that shouldn't change the qual ity of education. Most college guides tend to point out the negatives. For exam ple, The Insider's Guide to Colleges (1990) warns prospective students to choose their English professors carefully and refer to a weak sociol ogy program and unpopular per forming and visual arts programs at Bucknell. College guides also put labels on schools, such as The Insider's Guide to Colleges (1989) that calls Bucknell ""the country club on the Susquehana"" and Bucknell students ""preprofessionals"" and ""future yup pies."" In addition to labels, they also make generalizations such as ""Bucknell is probably not the right"
Let's Do Lunch,With Julie Bachman and Steve Hoerter Staff Writers
Perkin's Family Restaurant,
Rt. 15 across from Shorty's,
Open 24 hours a day,"If you look up in the sky towards town at night you can sec a beacon of light shining up towards the stars. If you were to follow its signal you'd find yourself on R t 15, proudly standing underneath a huge American flag all aglow -- in the driveway of Perkin's Family Restaurant. We were seated by the hostest (with the mostest) and presented with a colorful array of menu choices for lunch. Julie chose the Chef Salad ($5.29...nice round figure) mainly because of the menu description: ""Lean ham, turkey, plus American and Monterey Jack cheese piled on a bed of fresh salad greens garnished with fresh, crisp vege tables. Served in a munchy bowl of our own fresh baked French bread."" It was the munchy bowl that so intrigued Julie. Julie also dined on a cup of the cream of potato soup ($1.10), which she found to be a tad bit salty, but of a very creamy consis tency. She found the Chef Salad to be hearty, with generous portions of meat and cheese. The munchy bowl was an interesting con- cept...but was a bit too tough to handle. Steve sampled the turkey club croissant ($4.95), which was voraciously recommended by Aria, our waitress. Steve found the sandwich to be an extremely tasty treat. The french fries, which were included with the sandwich, were lacking in quantity, but were quite tantalizing. For dessert, Julie tried the ""Incredible Croissant Sundae"" ($1.99). She found the sundae to be a sweet-tooth junky's dream. Steve had the chocolate eclair ($1.25), and found it to be a creamy treat. The ambience of Perkin's is quite nice -- although some of the employees could use a nice, long, soapy shower, and a keg of Arrid Extra Dry. Perkin's boasts a fine, in-house bakery with selections ranging from carrot cake, muffins, breads, cookies and birthday cakes. Every thing looked QUITE yummy. Overall, Perkin's is a pleasurable dining establishment. Although we prefer non-franchise oriented establishments, Perkin's is an excellent dining alternative in the Lewisburg metro area. Julie and Steve give Perkin's three and one-half bison (on a scale of one to five.)"

jf,"place for a free-floating spirit seek ing inner discovery,"" as written in The Fiske Guide to Colleges (1991). Also, people tend to want to hear that the school they have cho sen is better than another school. Mr. Davies agrees, ""Financially, they deserve to hear accurate infor mation because they are making a big investment in their future. But, they also deserve to know the posi tives as well as the negatives."" Essentially, the goal of the publishers of these guides is to sell books. The college guides defend themselves by saying that they're being fair because they talk to the students. But, these sources of information could be as few as one or two students, which is a very narrow view of what is actually happening. And, as Mr. Davies points out, ""We as the public are playing right into their hands because we want simple answers to hard questions."""

W e're on our way,"With the first open forum, in what we hope will continue to be an open and aggressive restructuring pro cess, the administration has begun to clarify the issues and set a defined course of action. We're finally on our way to achieving changes that students have deserved for almost two years. We hope that this process is not simply a reaction, but a realization of the injustices and blatant disregard for equitable jus tice that have been imposed upon our community in recent months. Vince DeCerchio's 12 proposals for change are good ones--they will serve to reintroduce and reinforce students' basic rights as individuals. Mutual respect and common understanding are necessary ingredients are we begin to reestablish the Bucknell Community."
Appropriations,"The conclusion of the appropriations process for Bucknell Student Government (BSG) for this academic year has almost come to a close. With its conclusion new questions are being raised as to the equity of the dis bursement and the amount of funding available for student organizations. While Bill Lee, president of the Bucknell International Organization (BIO), argues for special attention due to the nature of the organization he represents, there are more important issues at hand. With an increasing number of student organizations requesting funds from BSG and a static amount of funding, the appropriations committee is faced with a difficult task. The Student Activities Fee, which is the source of the funds that BSG disburses, has remained static over the past four years. The University, for whatever reason, has decided not to increase this Fee even in light of such basic factors as inflation. Clearly, there is a need for an increase in student organization funding. Whether this comes from an increase in the Activities fee, or from the coffers of the University, is open for debate. This issue aside, there is an urgent need for the BSG appropriations committee to publish more detailed guidelines for the appropriations process. Student organizations are mystified by the entire process and feel budget slashing occurs in a haphazard and subjective manner. Published guidelines must be made available not only to demystify the process, but also to aid student organization treasurers in drawing up budget proposals. As the University pushes for alternatives to the Greek system, it must be willing to back its rhetoric with funding. Now is the time for the Trustees to act -- allocate more funds for student organizations. Those who sit on the appropriations committee possess a great deal of power, we can only hope that this power is used wisely and that the appropriations process is indeed fair and equitable."

BAC responds to student complaints,
about lack of scheduled events,"To the Editor: We are writing in response to the Freshman Forum article written by Jim Joseph in the November 2 issue of The Bucknellian. The article made the valid point that ""there must be some sort of activity planned for freshmen when there is no alternative recreation."" The Bucknell Activities Council (BAC) agrees, and would go further to say there should be activi ties available for everyone on cam pus, not only freshmen. However, it is a common misconception by Buck nell students that BAC is capable of providing many campus activities and is simply not doing so. We have already sponsored Christy's, comedi ans, musical acts, Bison Express trips, and movies nearly every Wednesday, Friday and Saturday night. Why did we not have anything scheduled on Homecoming Week end? The Office of Annual Giving had every public room on campus reserved so that no other events could be planned. It is their method of insuring that people go to the events that they have scheduled; the same practice is used by the Parents' Weekend Committee. It just so hap pens that the only event open to the public Saturday night was at the Weis Center. BAC did co-sponsor the Dessert Theatre that was held in the Terrace Room on Friday night. Why have we not done more for students? One of the reasons is a simple lack of peoplepower. BAC is run by students for students. There are other programming boards on campus, but we are one of the few to use all campus facilities on a regular basis. At the present time, we have a total of 70 members, approximately 30 of which are active in planning"

#EOXC-3Q5I,"events for a campus of 3300. If you care to figure out a percentage, it is less than 1% of the students pro gramming for the whole campus. Fortunately, these students are vol untarily committing many hours of their free time to try to enhance the campus social life. We are not required, by the administration or BSG, to provide a social outlet for the entire campus all of the time. Considering the resources we have, this is nearly impossible for us to do. It is also impossible for us to provide ""big- name"" concerts, such as Little Feat which cost $34,000, when our bud get is $30,000 per year. Even a little known entertainer, such as Alex Cole, who was on cam pus November 2, costs $1500 per hour. It is unfair for you to expect us to always be responsible for your weekend entertainment. The only way to remedy this situation is for more students to get involved. In order to know what you want and to be able to provide it for you, we need your opinion and involvement It is a belief of many Bucknel- lians that the social scene centers around alcoholic parties, often at fra ternity houses. Although that may be the case, the potential for non-greek student organization programming is great Realize that BAC is only per mitted to plan non-alcoholic events- because we are funded by the Uni versity. Everyone is welcome to attend or help organize our events; we do not distinguish between fresh men and upperclassmen, greeks and non-greeks. But this potential for programming will never be realized until those of you who find the present situation lacking get involved. I invite Jim Joseph, along with the rest of the Bucknell campus community to attend our next open meeting on November 15 at 6 pm in room 219 of the Langone Center. You have two options: sit back and complain about the social situation or get involved and try to change it Executive Board Bucknell Activities Council November 6,1990"
Junior encourages,
student activism,"To the Editor: The ""Halloween Riot,"" Buck- nell's excitement for the year has been compared to the social move ments of the 1960s. Students are say ing, ""Look, we are not apathetic, we stand up for what we believe in!"" Unfortunately that cause, that belief is rooted in alcohol: the free dom to get drunk, to throw up, and wake up the next morning with a hangover. As a member of suppos edly ""liberal"" groups on campus, I am glad to see Bucknell unite. It is hopeful that we are not an apathetic generation. But if you looked around, you would see that Amnesty International, FLAG, Reaction, SAMS, APO, etc. are giving you many reasons to become involved. No matter how much we fight it, underage drinking is against the law; human rights are not. So, Buck nell, please use this energy, use this emotion to work for a greater good! Nicole S.

"S,",1990 --------------------------------------------------------------------------- -
Freshman Forum,"By Richard Polt 'The Halloween night riots."" ""The Halloween night mas sacre."" ""Wednesday Bloody Wednesday."" These are all names for what might have transpired this past October 31st; luckily things didn't go that far. Thanks to the deft actions of certain individuals this Halloween will go down in Bucknell history as ""the night President Sojka had his own theme party."" And what a party it was: kegs at the U.C. and quad, hundreds of people crowding the streets and even...yes even reporters to preserve the epic soiree. So what was the theme? The themes, as we've heard all too many times, arc the ramifications of administrative drinking policies on campus social life. Although these issues concern me greatly, my wor ries lie in a different area. The social reforms we strive to attain do not justify the methods in which we go about getting them. Our rally which we hoped would be a reflection upon the debatable governing of our administration turned out to be a mockery of ourselves. This was apparent by the way the news reported and almost exploited the impromptu protest. I saw telecasts depicting a school where the students' number one priority was drinking. As if the only issue for which we would unify as an entire student body and face the threat of water hoses and dogs was for beer. Every news clip from the night showed people, my friends, drinking alcohol from cups and cans. From our perspective, it was something that just hap pened. The explosion of bottled-up feelings turned into a phys ical display of protest. From ""Joe T.V. Viewer"" 's angle, how ever, it was a bunch of kids who needed to get their act together. Even my father reacted with tentativeness towards the validity of our plight: ""of course we protested when I was your age, but for causes that had social significance."" As I watched the television reports I almost laughed at the sheer stupidity of the entire situation. I didn't laugh though; I couldn't laugh. Why wasn't it my face on the televi sion set? I stood alongside 1,000 other students, eager to see what would happen next. I was responsible for the rally just as much as any other student at Bucknell. Being a freshman, I knew of the stringent drinking policies at this school while applying last year. Obviously this knowledge didn't affect my final decision. Perhaps I am not bothered by the current drink ing regulations because they have been around as long as I have. In other words, I have no frame of reference to compare things with as do the upperclassmen. Nevertheless, I stood alongside them last Wednesday night, not sure why. Of course what really matters is not how others perceive what happened here, but how we do. If we understand why we protested and what we protested for, we are closer to solving the various problems which exist presently. If, however, the administration and students don't come to any substantial agreements, things might not end up as quietly as they did on Halloween."

Proposed incinerator brings many dangers,
Plan to burn toxic waste could compromise entire Susquehanna Valley.,"By Greg Adams USPCI, a subsidiary of Union Pacific, is applying for a permit to operate a hazardous waste incinera tor in Allenwood. Many in our Val ley fear such an incinerator, partic ularly in light of problems experienced by other communities. Others rightly criticize the sort of knee jerk ""not in my backyard"" reaction which accompanies every attempt at siting such a facility. I am currently opposed to the siting and would like to offer my reasons. I lay no claim to being a technical expert, and freely admit to being predjudiced by my fears of having a hazardous waste incinera tor within three miles of my home. I offer here an initial attempt to come to terms with some of the issues involved in a rational fashion. USPCI is applying under a 1988 law which effectively removes local veto power over such a siting. The law was enacted in order that Pennsylvania, a large producer of toxic wastes, could be able to take care of its own waste products in state. Although there is no univer sal agreement, many groups, including some environmental groups, believe incineration is a responsible way to dispose of cer tain toxic wastes. It is to be expected that a toxic waste inciner ator will be sited somewhere in Pennsylvania in the next 5 years, and the question to be decided is where it should go. I believe there are many valid reasons for not siting the incinera tor in Allenwood. My first concern involves the emissions from the incinerator. The theory of incinera tion is that all organic materials are converted into carbon dioxide and water as combustion products. Unfortunately, the process is much more complicated than this. For example, hazardous wastes contain many components which are inorganic, such as heavy metals or sulfur compounds. Moreover, even at very high temperatures, only a proportion, albeit an exceed ingly high proportion, of the organic materials can be com pletely burned. The EPA and DER (Depart ment of Environmental Resources of Pennsylvania) require that the net destruction of organic materials be at least 99.99 percent for certain organic materials and 99.9999 per cent for certain very dangerous materials such as PCB's. These per centages are verified by test bums performed under ideal conditions. I suspect that under normal conditions the efficiency of the incinerator would drop. Moreover, in order that the incinerator operate at near peak efficiency, it is neces sary that its operation be carefully planned and managed. Even accepting an incinerator operating at peak efficiency, the ""6 nines"" and ""4 nines"" destruction percentages allow for a certain amount of toxic gases. Certain materials which can be expected to be in the emissions can pose a health threat even at very low con centrations. For example, the amount of toxic material (PCB) spread in the Seveso disaster of 1976 was approximately 10 pounds. Other combustion products can be extremely dangerous. One such example is dioxins. Although it is very difficult to find direct evi dence, dioxins are suspected to have very potent effects on human beings in concentrations of a few parts per trillion. (Direct evidence is hard to come by in that dioxins rarely occur apart from other suspected agents, but experiments on rodents and monkeys point towards the pru dence of great caution in dealing with dioxins.) Dioxins become more concentrated as they pass through the food chain into beef, cows' milk and therefore eventu ally back to us. Another product in the com bustion emissions will be heavy metals which have been implicated in being carcinogenic. These, too, can travel up the food chain to reach higher animals and human beings. The chemistry involved in incineration seems to be quite com plicated and not necessarily well understood given the complex and not completely known input materi als. While one might be able to predict quite well the compo sition of most of the emissions, the ability to predict every thing released is impossible. As an example, in a 1986 report by Dow Chemical Corporation, it was reported that their scien tists could find no relationship between varia bles such as temperatures, feed rates, and pollution con trol devices and the emissions of dioxins in one of their inciner ators. Even voices from within the EPA have suggested that the knowledge as to the emis sions from incinerators is not well enough known to justify siting incinerators near humans. This incinerator would be located within a mile upwind of many homes as well as within two miles of the villages of Allenwood and Dewart. The outskirts of Wat- sontown are three miles downwind of the site, and following Watson- town there are several communities which can be considered downwind of the site. Moreover, there is much farmland within a few miles of the site. Thus, there is the worry of both airborne toxins as well as a gradual contamination of important farmland. I think that one can make the case that such facilities should not be placed very close to human com munities, and in our case this worry is magnified by the particular geog raphy of our Valley. We have very dense fogs which occur with fre quent regularity. Fog is known to be an effi cient scavenger of organic materi als. The presence of fog can increase the concentrations of some gases over a thousand times their usual equilibrium values. Moreo ver, the weather of the Valley is such that one would have to fear that the emissions could become concentrated in the Valley rather than dispersing. In Broome County, New York, similar concerns have lead the state of New York to seri ously consider a three year mora torium in a similar siting case so that accurate site specific weather data could be gathered. My second concern is an eco logical one. USCPI intends to create an above-ground landfill to store the ash from the incinerator. This ash contains components very toxic to the environment. The present plans are to bake the ash into cement bricks which are to be stored in an above-ground sand wich of plastics and covered with dirt. The plastic is intended to pre vent water from reaching the bricks and thereby allowing the toxic wastes to leach out into the ground water and nearby streams. The problem with this landfill is its close proximity to the Susque hanna river. Not only is the river an important source of drinking water, but it also feeds the Chesapeake Bay. Short term, the bricks will not pose much of a threat to the envi ronment. Long term however, there is a strong chance that the bricks will leach out and damage the river. Moreover, the daily operation of the incinerator would require the transfer and storage of dangerous materials from the shore of the river where the rail lines run, to the site of the incinerator a half-mile away. This would seem to be to be a real point of danger with great potential for a serious accident My third concern relates to the long-term development of the When their opinions were rejected, the local people then mon itored the landfill and made reports to DER. These reports included descriptions as to the strong likeli hood that its liner was damaged during construction. Two years later, these reports were followed by evidence that in fact leaching had already begun to occur. DER did not respond to these reports. Valley. There is much farming, and, relatively little heavy industry. The ""cultural"" attractions of this area are few compared to a more urban area. Still, as the slogan goes, ""It's a great place to live"". In fact, many people have chosen to settle or retire here because of a con scious choice to elect such a life style. Many have worked very hard to develop this area in such a way that its character is not greatly altered. Siting a hazardous waste incinerator in Allenwood would have negative developmental and economic consequences for the area, and indeed many local gov ernmental bodies have for this rea son voiced opposition to the siting. These bodies are frustrated that the area was forced to accept a landfill and a large prison complex against its will and question being forced to accept yet another negative development. Even a public perception of possible contamination of farm lands would have a devastating impact on the local agricultural industry. Moreover, an incinerator of this nature would assuredly inhibit the ability of local commu nities to direct development of the region by discouraging desirable industries and encouraging less desirable industries from settling in the Valley. There seems to be a basic question as to what extent, local communities should be able to determine their own futures. The emotionalism of the community reaction to the siting proposal has also been criticized. I would like to make a few com ments to this point which I feel are relevant. The state legislation which mandates the siting of an incinera tor calls for ""meaningful public participation"" in the siting process. Unfortunately, very few clues are given as to how this participation will be taken into account The public has a healthy dis trust of the objectivity of DER both because of the many former power ful politicians involved financially in this siting as well as because of past experience with DER. When the Lycoming landfill was pro posed, people tried to inform them selves as to its pros and cons. Being ultimately convinced that it was a bad idea, opponents attempted to fight it on technical grounds before the jury of DER. Respected experts from Penn State spoke against the wisdom of locating it at its present site. Now that DER is again being asked to judge a controversial siting, it should come as no surprise that many do not believe that a fair hearing will be made. Moreover, a decision by the local community to accept the new siting would require a certain amount of trust in USPCI. At this point, I do not believe that such trust has been earned. According to news accounts, the land obtained for the incinerator was said to be acquired under the pretense of being intended only for ""light industries"" by Pennswood Development Corporation. Moreo- ver, some people involved in the transaction suspect now that Penns wood was acting secretly as an agent for USPCI. Part of this belief is based on the fact that negotiations by Union Pacific to buy the needed rail con nections occurred even before negotiations by Pennswood to pur chase the land for the incinerator. Given the apparent previous lack of interest in these lines, one wonders what prompted the interest if not to connect with the planned incinera tor. This seems to be the basis for the general distrust of USPCI by local people."
I,am also disturbed that vir tually no data has been presented by
USPCI,"as to exactly what can be expected from their incinerator. In fact, any data which has been presented has been ""sugar coated"". At a Wat- sontown Area Business Associa tion meeting, the company represen tative was quoted as having answered a ques tion as to the emissions by naming only the harmless components of the emissions and then by adding that small amounts of carbon mon oxide would also be emitted. Pro fessor LaGrega supplemented this list with some of those things men tioned above. This seems typical to me of the way that USPCI has been presenting its case to our community. Those of us who are attempt ing to evaluate USPCI's proposal from a technical perspective are frustrated by the lack of detailed data being provided. Given the many variables involved here, and the length of time necessary to understand the implications of a particular incinerator plan, this lack of details makes it impossible to critique the siting on scientific grounds. It would seem that pru dence would dictate opposition until enough details arc known to convince one of the ultimate safety of this particular incinerator. Summing up, I feel that the proximity of this incinerator to local communities and farmland, and its proximity to the river make the Allenwood location highly questionable. Moreover, the partic ular geography of the region tends to exacerbate the dangers posed by this proximity. I am also disturbed by the possible negative impact on the quality of life in our Valley that this siting might imply. Finally, I am also disturbed by the apparent disdain on the part of USPCI for the opinions of the communities which would have to host this incinerator. In closing, I think that the question which must be posed is ""Are some backyards more appro priate than others?"" I think that the answer to this last question is yes. I think that the state made a major mistake in its 1988 legislation by not choosing to attempt to seek a consensus to define the meaning of the word ""appropriate."" I also think that this question cannot be approached without an attempt to quantify the dangers and economic implications of the siting of an incinerator or incinerators. Such a discussion requires that all known facts be displayed openly to all con cerned. Without such an open dis cussion, the siting of a hazardous waste incinerator anywhere would seem to be the unjust placement of a facility against the will of the people affected by it. Editor's Note: Greg Adams is an associate mathematics professor and member of the Organization United for Ecology. He is inter ested in educating himself and the community about the proposed incinerator."
Bucknell needs communication,"By Chris Bender The recent history of Bucknell is one of a community divided. This frustrating division has developed through a lack of communication between the administration and students. This lack of constructive dialogue has resulted in confusion and the much-talked about morale problems on campus. It is time to begin addressing the facts behind all the misunderstandings. The Common wealth of Pennsylva nia has placed the administration in a _______________ difficult position. They have the responsibility of enforcing an unde sirable law with much student opposition. The State has forced the administration to take on the respon sibility for the students, the responsibility which they, as young adults, should be permitted to develop for themselves. Students, on the other hand, feel confused and frustrated. They don't fully understand the rules and feel as if they are"

In col lege, students need to develop responsi bility for themselves, people. Students are Bucknell's campus. What happened on Halloween only reflects the tension I've felt since last year. The issue may have seemed to be alcohol, but the real issue on the night of the protest was the desire of the students to assume responsibility for themselves. The more responsibility they are given, the more pride they will have in themselves, and this will produce a uni versity overflowing with pride, school spirit, and morale. At the protest, I was proud of my school for the first time, not because of the issue of Act 31, but because we were working together as a community. There was unity, honesty, and spirit; the normal boundaries of cliques came down. This is what Bucknell should be and can be through a tighter, informed community. Bucknell needs to continue to find ways to improve the dialogue between the administration and the students. In my high school, we always knew what was going on "" * because there was a school meeting in the auditorium every morn ing. This obviously can't happen here, but the results of the mect- ing can: communica tion. Perhaps this can be achieved through forums or at least a newsletter, giving students a chance to see what the administra tion is doing and what they are thinking. On a cam pus with these controversial issues, this is essential for a content community. The administration says things will change and perhaps they will, but this will not truly cure the issue. As a university in need of higher morale, the administration must communicate with the students so this school can feel like a commu nity. The students of Bucknell have shown _______________ through their actions (some stupid) that they want to be proud of Bucknell. I heard President Sojka say on the night of the protest that all that was important was that no one was hurt. That was important, but more important was the fact that as a student body we were willing to put ourselves in a vulnerable position. Let the stu dents be responsible for themselves and let the administration guide them through their college experience instead of dictating it Editor's Note: Chris Bender is a sophomore and Social Chairman for Delta Upsilon fraternity."

Water polo finishes at 15-10,
Bison finish fourth a t Mid-Atlantic Championships,"By Scott Pollins Staff Writer This past weekend, the Buck nell water polo team traveled to Princeton University for the MAC championships. Bucknell polo fin ished a strong season with an impressive 15-10 record. The Bison first played Queens University. Bucknell played extremely well, jumping out to a commanding 10-4 lead after three quarters. The team cruised to the victory 13-7 in a tremendous team effort Captain John Zciglcr '91 led the charge with three goals, while Tim Smaldonc 'GR and Steve Ben son '92 added two apiece. John Bradbury '92 registered a fine per formance in goal, turning away 10 shots. * Bucknell next played a tough Navy squad. The Bison came out tough and surged to a 3-1 first quar ter margin. The Midshipmen responded with a very strong front and press defense which blanked the Bison for the next two quarters."
Erom LeftfjelcL,
..,"By Mark Griffith and Eric Smith Staff Writers This season's National Basketball Association will showcase many new faces, as a strong draft has added many legitimate all-stars to the teams. Look for the younger teams to do well, while some of the top teams of previous years will face strong challenges from many up-and-coming squads. This year promises to hold some surprises and a new NBA champion to thwart the Detroit Pistons' drive to ""three- peat."" Here arc our picks in order of predicted finish: Eastern Conference Atlantic Division The Philadelphia 76ers look to repeat as division champs, and the off-season acquisition of 7'-7"" Manure Bol could be the big man to help Charles Barkley and the crew achieve this goal. The strong inside play of Rick Mahom will help Phillic muscle to the lop once again. Lack of a strong bench will keep the New York Knicks from landing on top of the division. All-Star Patrick Ewing will need the outside shot of Kiki Vandcweghc and inspired play from Mark Jackson to oust the 76crs. The aging Boston Celtics will need help from their younger players to stay competitive. The Miami Heat look to rookies Willie Burton, Alex Kessler, and Bimbo Coles to help them build a solid team in the coming years. The Washington Bullets better be nervous even with Pcrvis Ellison because not even this big man can save them. For the New Jersey ""Nets and Derrick Coleman, better luck next century, when all those draft picks might make them competitive. Central Division The ""thrcc-pcat"" minded Detroit Pistons have only gotten bet ter with age. Rookie Lance Blanks, known as a defensive specialist, will sec limited time due to a great starting five and the best bench in the league. Look for Air Jordan to lead the Chicago Bulls into a close battle with the Pistons. Stacey King, Scottic Pippcn and Horace Grant might make life miserable in Motown. The Indiana Pacers, led by stand-out Reggie Miller and helped by the strong play of Detlef Schrcmpf, arc still missing a strong inside game to compete with the big boys. The Cleveland Cavaliers arc a good all-around team, but the presence of Danny Ferry might catapult this team to a level of other Cleveland sports teams: good, but not quite good enough. The Human Highlight Film, Dominique Wilkins, will lead the Atlanta Hawks to a respectable, but average fifth-place finish. The Milwau kee Bucks made few off-season changes, and lack of a first-round draft pick will make for a long season. The Charlotte Hornets will need help from rookie Kendall Gill, as well as a monster season from J. R. Reid in order to creep out of the cellar. Western Conference Midwest Division The San Antonio Spurs, led by David Robinson and friends, will go far this season. Drafting Dwayne Schintzius will provide a quality back-up at center, and thus will allow the Admiral to rest for the playoffs. The Mailman will make his rounds and the Utah Jazz will pose a serious threat in the division. A strong backcourt anchored by John Stockton will help free up the inside game, and put Karl Malone back on the starting All-Star line-up. The league's best center, Akccm ""The Dream"" Olajuwon, will keep the Houston Rockets in the thick of things in the Midwest. The Dallas Mavericks will need strong play from their guards Fat Lever, Derek Harper, and Rolando Blackman if they arc to stay above .500. The Denver Nuggets hope to strike gold with sensational rookie Chris Jackson, but lack of defense will keep the gold rush to a minimum. The Orlando Magic, who acquired sharp-shooter Dennis Scott, arc still lacking an inside game, and it will show. The best named team, the Minnesota Timber- wolves, won't bite, but rookie Felton Spencer might help this team win a few games. Western Division The Portland Trailblazers will combine strong inside and out side play to dethrone the L.A. Glamour Boys from the top of the divi sion. Clyde ""The Glide"" Drcxlcr and Terry Porter will help pave the way to the playoffs. The Phoenix Suns look to Tom Chambers and Kevin Johnson to spur on the offense, while Kurt Rambis will provide the spark needed on defense. Look for Phoenix to go far in the post season. The Los Angeles Lakers will need some Magic this year. This is a case of a strong team in a stronger division, but never count them out. The combination of Danny Manning and Bo Kimble will make the Los Angeles Clippers the surprise team in the Western Division. The Golden State Warriors have the forwards in Chris Mullin and Terry Teaglc to go far, but lack of a center is their down fall. Head Coach K. C. Jones will wish he were back in Boston, as the Seattle Supersonics lack a bench. Four first-round draft choices and numerous off-season moves will not rescue the Sacramento Kings from being cellar-dwellers this year. NBA Final Round Eric picks San Antonio to beat the Detroit Pistons, while Mark goes with the Spurs over the 76crs.

"class, sportsmanship, and played with their",
"heart and soul every weekend.""","sivc battle fought by each squad 9- 6. Danny Brown '93 led the Bison with three goals. Buckncll's final game was against arch-rival Iona. This was a crucial game for both teams, since the winner would likely advance to the Eastern Championships. Both teams played an extremely physical and close game. Bucknell Coach Lynn Kachmarick felt that ""our luck just fell short at times."" After yielding two early scores in the fourth quarter, the Bison trailed 10- 5. It was at this point that Buck- ncll's courage and dedication took over. The Bison stormed back with four unanswered goals that brought them to within one score. With sec onds remaining, time ran out on a valiant effort as Buckncll's last shot missed the goal, which left Iona victorious 10-9. Kachmarick lauded her team on an impressive comeback by stressing, ""We arc never a team that gives up. We fought back until the very end."" Bradbury played one of his finest games in goal to cap the sea son. He registered 13 saves, while also blocking a key penalty shot. Kevin Schroth '92 started the comeback with five big goals. Bucknell finished the champion ships ranked fourth out of eight teams. Among a field of roughly 160 players, these two star Bison stood out by playing exceptional polo. Reflecting on this year's sea son, Kachmarick said, ""We had many big moments. Our first team goal was to improve on our stand ings in last year's tournament, which we did."" As the season progressed, the Bison reset their goals to reflect their improving performance. Bucknell was ranked as high as #19 nationally, a tribute not only to the players and coaches, but to the entire water polo program as well. Coach Kachmarick sums up her team's effort by maintaining, ""We had a quality group of young men and women who represented Bucknell with class, sportsmanship, and played with their heart and soul every weekend."" Graduation will leave the Bison with some big losses, includ ing Zciglcr, Mead Briggs, Tim Smaldone and two dedicated man agers, Wendy Fillippo and Brid- gettc Cleft. The returning squad will be very competitive next year. Boast ing top scorers Schroth, Brown, and Walter Kelly '92, Bucknell will also return the top goalie in the East, Bradbury. After an extremely successful season, the Bison water polo squad can stand tall and walk proud."
Athlete of the Week,Photo courtesty of Sports Information
Lester Erb '91,"Wide receiver Lester Erb '91 earns Athlete of the Week hon ors following his record-setting performance in last weeks football game versus Holy Cross. Erb hauled in both Bison touchdowns dur ing the team's 43-14 loss to the Crusaders. Those two catches gave Erb the Bucknell single-season record for touchdown receptions with 10. This surpassed the previous mark set by Mike Guerrini in 1987. Erb is now tied with former Bucknell great Tom Mitchell '66 for career touchdown receptions with 18. Tomorrow at Lehigh, Erb will have an opportunity to set a new record should he catch a touchdown pass. Erb, who is third on the Bucknell all-time receiving yard list with 1,664, has caught 35 passes for 580 yards this season. Honorable Mention Kevin Schroth '92 led a valiant comeback on the part of the water polo squad, which placed fourth at the Mid-Atlantic Champi onships in Princeton, New Jersey last weekend. After trailing to eastern powerhouse Iona by six goals in the game's final quarter, Schroth sparked the Bison offense with five goals. Unfortunately, the comeback fell just short and the Bison lost 10-9. For his efforts, Schroth was named to the All-Toumament first team."
Volleyball to conclude year,
at Patriot League tournament,"By Todd Bianchine Staff Writer The women's volleyball team will travel to Holy Cross tomorrow for the Patriot League Champion ships, as the Lady Bison look to upset the Lady Red Raiders of Col gate University in both teams' first- round match. Colgate has already beaten Bucknell once this season 15-7,15- 4, 15-2, but that hasn't discouraged Bucknell Coach Cindy Opalski's squad, who is still hungry for its first Patriot League win. Army won the regular-season title and grabbed the top seed of this weekend's tourney, giving the Lady Cadets a first round bye. Col gate took the second seed. ""I think winning the confer- ence championship is a realistic goal,"" said Opalski. ""We know we can play at this level and anything can happen in a tournament."" If Bucknell manages to beat Colgate the Lady Bison would play the winner of the Holy Cross- Lafayette game. The winner of the Fordham- Lchigh game is scheduled to take on Army. If the Lady Bison lose their initial game, the best they could do is third place. Bucknell was supposed to take on the Golden Eagles of Clar ion University last Saturday for a final warm-up before the tourna ment, but Clarion's bus broke down and the match had to be cancelled. Bucknell finished the regular- season with a 3-19 record overall, 0-6 in conference play."

Men's soccer,"From page 16 stimulate some sort of offensive attack, the shorthanded defense got caught with a three on two disad vantage that Lafayette's Temo Pape capitalized on to give the Leopards some extra insurance. That goal quieted the Bucknell crowd for the time, but the fans responded as the Bison continued to play hard. Bucknell's Bill Connors '93 headed a ball over the Lafayette keeper's head into the goalmouth two min utes later, but the Lcopards's All- League defenseman Tom Neale came out from nowhere to rob the Bison with a beautiful bicycle kick save from the goal line. This play just seemed to typify Bucknell's day."
Football,"From page 16 ble the ball and throw an intercep tion. Holy Cross took this punt and drove again for the touchdown 45 yards in 11 plays, seven of which were on the ground. The touch down was again scored by Segreti, who dove over the left side to make the score 28-14. He ended the day rushing for an even 100 yards on 20 carries. The next Holy Cross score came following a blocked punt. The Crusaders took over the ball on the Bucknell 16. Jerome Fuller ran the ball down to the two-yard line on the next play to set up the score. The score marked 21 unanswered points in just over nine minutes of play. After punts by both teams, Jeff Kelly '92 was brought in to try and cut down Holy Cross' 21-point lead. He was 2-5 in his first drive for 14 yards. While Kelly was una ble to take the Bison into scoring position, he did take the offense into Holy Cross territory for the Yet, the Bison never quit and even in the final seconds an out standing individual effort from Kirk Lorie '91 saved a goal on a breakaway to keep the final score at 2 - 0 . On Sunday, Lafayette played the winner of the other semifinal matchup, Fordham, for the League Championship. Once again, regula tion ended with the two teams in a scoreless tie. This time, Lafayette was not as fortunate as Fordham's Rado Randriamamongy scored at 2:56 of the first extra period to give the Rams the victory and the title. The win ended an exciting week end of collegiate soccer at Bucknell that featured two overtime games and a 1-0 victory by Fordham over Colgate on Saturday. first time since halftime. Holy Cross took over on its own 24-yard line following a 25- yard punt by John Toman '92. Holy Cross then drove 76 yards on 6 plays scoring just 12 seconds into the fourth quarter on a 40-yard pass from Ciaccio to Gallagher. Gallagher caught a total of seven passes on the day for 70 yards. The score was set up by a 17-yard run by Segreti and a 16- yard pass to Jack Lavelette. The score became 43-14 as Gallagher dove into the endzone after fielding a low snap for the two-point conversion. The only highlight of the fourth quarter was a drive which began with a 30-yard pass from Kelly to Matt Walsh '93. That was Walsh's third catch of the day for a total of 51 yards. On the next Kevin McElvene '93 ran for 13 yards up the middle. But, three plays later Kelly fumbled while scrambling on third down and long play. The Bison allowed 486 yards for the game, but Maranzana still Though the Bison didn't play in the finals on Sunday, their sea son was by no means a disappointment With the mediocrity that the team had displayed in the past, its 12-5-1 record showed remarkable improvement from 1989, and they surprised quite a few teams this year. ""We had reservations going into this season,"" said Reynolds. ""In all honesty, we were just hop ing for a .500 season. As things went on we just gained more and more confidence. Everyone made a sincere effort to make the team the first priority. I think the seniors and the team as a whole was tired of being mediocre. I'm really happy for the seniors and their has faith in the defense. ""We still have to be able to make the plays in tough situations. The defense was in bad field position three times in the second half and Holy Cross scored on all three. We have to stop them on at least one of those."" Bucknell was only able to muster 226 yards of its own, and only 58 in the second half. Bucknell only got three first downs in the second half. The team rushed for -2 yards in the final two quarters. Next week the Bison travel to Lehigh, to take on the Engineers who are 6-3, 2-1 in the Patriot League. Lehigh is coming off a big 52-7 win against Colgate which put them in second place in the Patriot League, just a game behind the Crusaders. The Bison must figure a way to keep the quality of their play equal from the first half to the sec ond if they hope to win. Also, they have to stick to the basics. The series which dates back all the way to 1888 is led by the Engineers 26- accomplishmcnts."" ""I think the key was that we had some leadership from all the seniors this year,"" said tri-captain Terry Pelino '91. ""We had great team chemistry."" ""We were so successful because all the guys were closer this year,"" echoed tri-captain Kirk Lorie '91. ""We had more fun, there was a better atmosphere, and we were winning."" ""It wasn't even necessarily skill,"" continued tri-captain Bran don Poe '91. ""It was much more enjoyable to play because of the way people wanted to win for each other."" Reynolds probably summed it up best when he stated, ""It was just a great year!"" 24 with 3 ties. Last year, the Bison were crushed by Lehigh 52-6 on Homecoming."

Holy Cross thrashes football 43-14,
Bison look to snap three-gome skid tomorrow at Lehigh,"By Scott Brown Staff Writer The Bison football team con tinued to struggle, dropping its third straight 43-14 to Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts last Saturday. With the loss, the Bison slipped into fourth-place in the Patriot League with a 1-2 record. All four of the Bucknell's losses have come in a similar man ner. Buckncll has played well in the first half and then been outplayed in the second half. In the four defeats, Buckncll has outscorcd its opponents 77-44 in the first half, only to be outscored in the second half of those games 103-26. Head Coach Lou Maranzana realizes this problem: ""We've started out better than we've finished. Teams have had better play in the second half. We are learning how to continue to improve throughout the game after our good start."" A big reason for this discrep ancy can be attributed to the inabil ity to bolster a running game in each of the losses. When the Bison have won they have done so by averaging 224 yards a game on 54 carries. In defeat, Buckncll has averaged only 144 yards a game, running the ball just 36 times a contest. Buckncll gains almost twice as many yards per carry in victory than in defeat. Buckncll has not rushed for 200 yards since October 6 against Towson State when it rushed for 309 yards. The game at Holy Cross last Saturday was no different as Buck ncll ended with 38 carries for only 25 yards. The leading rusher was Brian Hcncsey '91 who rushed for 31 yards on 11 attempts. He has only rushed for 140 yards in the last four games, as opposed to 527 yards in his first five. Maranzana stressed the importance of the run ning game stating, 'The running game is absolutely a key to win ning. It allows us to possess the ball and do the things we want to do. It helps our passing game as # <<*>> well as our defense."" The Crusaders had the game's first score on their second possession following a three-yard punt by Jason Fralick '93. Fralick had a rough day before being replaced late in the third quarter. He punted six times on the day for an average net of only 19.3 yards. He also had one of his kicks blocked. Holy Cross got the ball on its own 41 yard line and drove the 59 yards in just four plays culmi nating with a screen pass from Tom Ciaccio to Michael Lewis which totalled 37 yards. Holy Cross got the ball back on the Bison 39-yard line after forc ing Buckncll to punt after three plays. The Crusaders went the 39 yards in nine plays finishing with a five-yard pass from a scrambling Ciaccio to Mark Gallagher to make the score 14-0 with 3 minutes 47 seconds to play in the first quarter. Buckncll did battle back, though, scoring a touchdown on its next possession to narrow the gap to seven points. The drive, which covered 70 yards, was kept alive by a holding call on Holy Cross on 4th down and 3. It was also sparked by Todd Hatajik '91's 24-yard comple tion to Dan Scocca '91. The touch down was a 31-yard Hatajik strike over the middle to a wide open Lester Erb '91. The Crusaders opened second quarter by driving all the way to the Bucknell four-yard line, before Pat Kenny missed a 21-yard field goal. Bucknell got the ball back on its own 20-yard line, and mounted a ball control drive which lasted over five minutes before tying the score on a quick pass in the left comer of the endzone from Hatajik to Erb. Erb's second touchdown catch gave him his 18th career touchdown reception putting him in a tie for first on Buckncll's all-time list. It was also his 10th touchdown recep tion of the season, a new Buckncll record. For the day, Erb had six catches for 77 yards. He has caught passes totalling 1,664 yards for his career placing him third all-time at Buckncll. At halftime, the statistics were fairly even with a slight advantage going to the Crusaders, who had 247 yards total offense compared to Bucknell's 168. Ciaccio was 13-17 #* "" M SS>>*"

Hatajik was 11-17 for 141 yards with two touchdown passes. The second half, however, was all Holy Cross, particularly the third quarter, in which the Crusad ers scored on four of the five pos sessions. The first Holy Cross pos session began on the Bucknell 30 yard line, following a 15-yard return of a 29-yard Fralick punt. It took the Cmsadcrs just 1:29 to score, taking a seven-point lead that they would not relinquish. The touchdown was scored by fullback Joe Segreti on a six-yard burst up the middle. Bucknell was forced to punt again on its next possession for the third straight time. The Bison would punt the first six times they got the ball in the second half. In their last two possessions following these punts, the Bison would fum- See FOOTBALL, page 15"

Men's soccer finishes season,
with semifinal loss to Lafayette,"By Chad Bown Staff Writer An excellent men's soccer season came to an unfortunate and abrupt end last Saturday, when Bucknell lost to Lafayette in the first round of the Patriot League playoffs. The defeat was in no way indicative of the Bison's outstand ing year. Fordham was the week end's big winner, as they took the overall championship. Buckncll hosted the fourth- seeded Lafayette Leopards for the first semifinal matchup before a large Bison crowd on an Indian summer-like day. Lafayette came out strong, and it took some great defense from the Bucknell full backs to prevent them from grab bing the early lead. The Bison were careless and seemed cojnplacent in the early going, and almost paid the price when Lafayette had a clear shot on goal at 5:00 but only man aged to hit the post. ""We were terribly flat in the first fifteen minutes,"" stated Coach Reynolds. ""I assume we were just"

The problem was we just never got into the tempo of the game."" The Bison hung on to the end of the half and were lucky to find the score still knotted at 0-0. Buck nell was clearly outplayed and could mount very little offensive pressure in the opening stanza. The second half proved more interesting for both sides, as each team had many golden opportuni ties to score. Alex Kogan '94, Dan D'Angelo '92, and Jon Mackenzie '93 all showed offensive improve ment in the second half, but still the Bison could not put one ball into the net. Both Bucknell and Lafay ette each exchanged offensive flur ries in the final minute of play before regulation ended in a score less tie. The format of the overtime entailed two extra fifteen minute periods, to be played to their com pletion. The Bison had the first chance to score when Steve John son '91 broke free from the Lafay ette defense and looked poised for a goal before a great individual effort from the Leopards's Bill Mazor stopped the Bison's offensive threat. Bucknell caught some luck of its own when Lafayette's Rob Dos- tert found himself in front of the net with a clear attempt on goal, but he slipped on the grass and was unable to get a shot off. The good luck was short lived, however, as Lafayette's Scott Reamer knocked his own rebound past Bucknell keeper Mark Wrigley '94 with 59 Dcardorff '92, Jeff Loomis '92, Bob Kelly '92, Jason Cahilly '92, and Tom Wuchenich '92. Colgate's Thomas Kennedy kept the Bison from grabbing all of the top-ten spots by placing seventh. Kennedy's performance helped the Red Raiders to capture second-place with 67 points, well behind Bucknell's total of 15.

"Kappa Sigma, TKE",
criminally charged,"By Travis Elliott Staff Writer Both Kappa Sigma and Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternities have been charged with furnishing alco hol to minors in relation to two sep arate incidents that occurred this semester. On Sunday September 16, Lewisburg Police apprehended two eighteen-year-old Bucknell stu dents on South Fifth Street and cited them for consumption and possession of alcohol under the legal age of 21. During question ing, the two students indicated that they had been drinking at a party on South Fifth Street Lewisburg police then went to 38 South Fifth St. where officers alleged that a party attended by about fifty college-age students was in progress. The residents, Stephen Casey '91, Brandon Poe '91 and David Gutheil '91 are all members of Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity. According to Lewisburg Police reports, during a meeting with Lieutenant Lee Yount the three residents said that the party was really a TKE fraternity- sponsored function and the beer was furnished by members of the TKE fraternity. Tau Kappa Epsilon was consequently charged with two counts of furnishing alcohol to a minor, a violation of Pennsylvania Criminal Code #6310.1. Mark Roessler '92, the presi dent of TKE fraternity, refused to comment at the present time. Nei ther Casey, Poe, nor Gutheil could be reached for comment.

Student charged in assault,"By Steve Hoerter Staff Writer After a two hour confronta tion early Sunday morning, Cur ran Robert McCann '93, was arrested and charged with more than 10 counts of different mis- meanor and summary charges. According to Union County Court records, at approxi mately 12:50 a.m. on Sunday, Nov. 11, a resident assistant con tacted the Department of Security and Safety to report excessive noise coming from a room on the 4th floor of Larison Hall. Information released by the Department of Security and Safety indicates that the R.A. confronted an unknown person, later identified as McCann, and asked him to leave the premises. McCann then proceeded to refuse and became violent, threatening members of the hall. Security officers James Warner and Sgt. Dolores Stafford were dispatched to the scene at 1:03 a.m. to investigate the report of a ""Disorderly Person."" Warner reported that he arrived on the fourth floor of Harris Hall, at which time he attempted to obtain identification from McCann. According to Warner, he was ""met with negative results."" Moments later, Stafford arrived and reports that she attempted ""to intervene and calm [McCann] down."" Both officers reported that McCann became verbally abusive, and then proceeded to push Staf ford out of the way and run from Harris Hall into Larison Hall. The officers pursued McCann, and caught up with him in the second floor stairwell of Harris. According to Warner, McCann ""smelled like beer and appeared to be intoxicated."" The officers once again attempted to obtain identification from McCann, but were unable to succeed. McCann, report the offi cers, was verbally abusive and approached Warner ""in an offen sive manner."" According to Warner, McCann screamed, ""F-- you assh--, f--ing fat pig mother f-- ers."" According to court records, Warner stated that McCann then ""threw a punch and hit me in the neck, after he had pushed me, and the punch knocked me into the rail ing of the stairs. I attempted to defend myself by pushing him in the chest to get him away from me, so that he couldn't push me down the stairs. He then attempted to wrestle me to the ground and as a result we both fell to the floor and I was able to temporarily restrain him."" Warner explained that he released his hold on McCann and the two returned to their feet Warner reported that McCann ""continually got in our faces yelling statements such as 'You f--ing pig. You fat f--, I'm going to kill you.'"" At 1:13 a.m. Stafford requested the presence of Director of Security Vince DeCerchio. Although McCann continued to use abusive language, Stafford explained that she and Warner were satisfied with letting him ""scream and yell until Director DeCerchio arrived."" Both offi cers' security reports collaborated with one another. Upon his arrival at 1:19 a.m., DeCerchio reported that he identified himself as the director of security, to which McCann responded, ""F-- you, assh--,"" and ""Who the f-- are you, assh-- ?"" DeCerchio continued, ""At this time I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath."" According to court records, See ASSAULT, page 2"
Curriculum debate continues,"By Lisa Hirschkorn Staff Writer Critical thinking and multi perspectives lie at the heart of the General Education Council's cur riculum proposal. Spurred by last May's student petition, the debate on education continues, and the revised ""freshman foundation semi nar"" might be only six weeks away. ""Within six weeks, we'll know what the recommendation is,"" said Jackson Hill Associate Dean of Arts and Sciences. The General Education Council's rec ommendation, if approved by the Curriculum Committee, will then go to the floor of the faculty. These recommendations, in turn, could go into effect next semester for the Class of '95. In the meantime, the proposal airs on the debate floor as students, faculty and administrators tackle complex issues. ""The students presented the petition to me last May."" said Larry Shinn, vice-president of academic affairs. Shinn explained ""What I promised the students first of all is that I would present the petition to the faculty itself at its first meeting in the fall. The students are asking us to consider a formal requirement for race, gender and other kinds of 'otherness' studies that they believe is appropriate for every Bucknell student to have."" Yet, the general education council, formed two years ago, began discussing multicultural issues before the student petition wielded their demands. In Septem ber, 1989, Shinn's initiative to relate students' attitudes in the classroom and in actuality began. Shinn said ""Independent of that petition coming I had already decided that previous spring to name a committee this fall on The Climate for Learning and Diversity at Bucknell. The intention of this study is to ascertain the need for sensitizing students to courses of race and gender. The Committee asks questions about the extent to which we are providing a hospita ble climate -- for women and for minorities, for example. I don't mean just in the classroom but also in the social and residential environment."" While the General Educa tional Council has been considering this petition,"" Shinn continued, ""I have been meeting with this com mittee, the Climate for Learning and Diversity at Bucknell, which has about twenty-five members -- they are students, faculty, adminis trators, and support persons. The intention of this group is to investi gate what actually is the learning environment at Bucknell -- from the perceptions of students, from the perceptions of faculty, and the perceptions of alumni, support staff, and support offices on cam pus"" [support offices include peo ple from the library to the Multicul ture Center, and support persons range from custodians to secretar- ies]. Shinn explained that these four separate groups, derived from the large steering committee, will con duct surveys and interviews of each respective group -- students, alumni, faculty, and support offices and support staff. The General Education Council is appointed by the faculty of the College of Arts and Sciences and its Council Members are as fol lows: the Dean and Associate Dean of Arts and Sciences, six faculty members, a Race/Gender represen tative, and a Curriculum Commit tee representative. The Council's eventual proposal will pass from the departments to the Curriculum Committee, and then onto the faculty. ""The process is quite cum bersome and that's part of the trou ble that the students who presented the petition have -- they just thought we could just do it, "" said Eugenia Gerdes, Dean of the Col lege of Arts and Sciences. Gerdes expounded upon this actual process and the goals of the Council. ""Before the petition was even developed, we talked about the integration of race, gender and multiculture issues into the curricu lum. We brought the issue to the General Education Council and we said, 'look this group is interested in how we're planning to integrate and if we're planning to integrate race, gender and multiculture issues See CURRICULUM, page 5"
S.T.O.P. protests U.S. role in Gulf,"Colin Brldgewater/The Bucknellian of the 54 U.S. soldiers who have died in the Gulf conflict were placed on the uphill side Students and Teachers Organized for Peace. Graves in memory of the Langone Center by S.T.O.P., By Andrew Cohen Staff Writer Fifty-four mock graves were placed on the uphill side of the Langone Center on Tuesday in memory of the soldiers who have died thus far in the Persian Gulf Conflict. The 'grave tally' will remain until Thanksgiving. The emerging activist organization"
"STOP,","Students and Teachers Organized for Peace, used the graves to encourage ""people to edu cate themselves, to discuss the issue, and ... to join us,"" according to Mark Larson '92, a member of the twelve person committee. STOP has several other activities planned this semester to increase awareness of the situation in the Persian Gulf. According to Larson, 'The Bucknell progressive caucus formed a subcommittee to begin to react to the situation in the Gulf ... STOP has been organized by a group of students who are opposed to a war in the Gulf, who feel that the present course of events is lead- ing us toward that war for reasons that are either hypocritical or illegal."" Larson explained that STOP does not ""condone what Saddam did, it's obviously wrong,"" but says ""continued sanctions against Iraq"" is the answer. STOP finds serious problems with the reasons that the U.S. is involved in the conflict. Larson identified three possible reasons that the U.S. could use for going to war, and the reasons why STOP feels that they are not compelling. ""If we're going to war for oil, the oil provided by Iraq and Kuwait, and even ... Saudi Arabia represents only 15% of the world population of oil, and a minimal amount of U.S. oil. If we're going to war to punish Iraq ... the U.S. has a lot of outstanding issues that it itself should deal with in terms of its attacks on Panama, Grenada, and the Dominican Republic. If we're going to war to defend this new world order in which the U.S. acts as the policeman or big brother who's going to dictate the morality of this world order, we don't approve of that."" Larson emphasized that there are other options for handling the Gulf crisis. ""We don't want to fall into the trap where you either con done what Saddam Hussein did or agree with what President Bush is doing."" STOP'S plans include a letter writing drive to members of the U.N., Congress, and White House staff. More importantly ""we're try ing to make a public statement aobut our opposition to war in the Gulf."" STOP has passed out rib bons to those people who wish to voice their disagreement with U.S. policy in the Gulf. As an effort to involve more students, STOP sent letters to every professor asking them to take 30 minutes out of class time and discuss the conflict. Larson explained that professors are free to decide whether they think it is professional to do so. ""It's an indi vidual choice for the professor."" See STOP, page 5"

Joe Clark speaks at Weis Center,"Ashley Cherlkof/The Bucknellian Joe Clark signs autographs after speaking at the Weis Center Wednesday night. By Tara G . Gilligan Staff Writer In a dramatic display of met aphors, cliches, and allusions to lit erature, Joe Clark, on whom the movie Lean on Me was based, told a capacity audience to never stop trying to succeed. Clark, who spoke at the Weis Center on Wednesday, discussed the importance of suc ceeding, the concerns of blacks, and of the troubles in the educational system. "" I am the master of my fate, the captain of my soul, and thus I say to you this glorious evening, Bison, be sure, be very, very, very sure that you are in control of your own destiny,"" said Clark, who has been recognized as a controversial figure because of the actions he took as principal of Eastside High. Clark transformed the New Jersey high school from a haven for drugs to a respectable school. Clark seemed proud o f his controversial status, pointing out that throughout history, only con troversial nations contributed any thing to the world. Contrasting these nations to the neutral Switzer land, he said, ""The only thing Switzerland gave the world was the cuckoo clock."" Once a child in a family on welfare, Clark claims that only per sistence will bring about success. ""Whatever you do in this life don't you ever give up, don't you ever quit ... The slaughterhouse of fail ing is not your destiny. You must persist to succeed,"" he said. Clark ended this portion of his speech by saying that ""success is failure turned inside out"" And, once again turning to cliche, Clark pointed out that America can succeed only when everyone works together. "" Divided we will fall, together we will stand,"" he said. ""There's something I believe, Bison... I belive that some how we're going to bring about some changes in this world,"" Clark said. And the changes he referred to, came out in his vocal opposition to programs such as affirmative action. ""History shows me that affirmative action and quota svstems have never worked anywhere else in the world,"" he said, pointing out failed programs in Malasia, India, and Nigeria. With a dominating tone in his voice, Clark asked, "" Don't you understand that you cannot do for people what they cannot do them selves. You cannot take from one person and give to another."" Clark, himself a black American, displayed his agitation at being called an African Ameri can. The label, he said, has divided the black population in America into two groups. ""We have become a nation ality of squibbling nationalities,"" he said. Poking fun at distinction by color, Clark said, ""The color of freedom is green. I have enough money to do whatever I want to do."" Clark also discussed the problems in the educational system, saying that teachers are the founda tion of America, though they remain "" overworked, underpaid, [and] controlled by administrators and bureaucrats."" An advocate of allowing parents to decide where to send their children for school, Clark pointed out that America's students are poor in math science and spelling. Clark began his attempts to reform education by starting at Eastside High, where drug abuse was rampant. In curbing the drug problem in Eastside High, Clark made some controversial decisions. Immedi ately upon becoming principal of the school, Gark expelled 300 stu dents who he referred to as "" thugs and pathological deviants"" and who he had no hope of affecting. Today, Clark claims the high school is drug free. But besides expelling the core of drug dealers, Clark's disci plinary measures were met by criti cism from some. Often Clark stood in the hall with a bullhorn, telling students to walk quickly to class and to stay on the right side of the hall. Not willing to accept tardi ness, Clark once suspended 500 students in a single day for tardiness. ""To me, he's too much of a dictator to run a school. It had to be his way or no way,"" said one teacher who eventually resigned from Eastside High. ""Oh I admit that maybe once a week I have a crucifixion just to boost morality,"" Clark said in a Connie Chung special which he showed to the audience. Despite the harsh fist with which he governed, Clark main tains that ""discipline is not the enemy of enthusiasm."" Clark may have been the object of much criticism, but he did have followers as well. A  member of the first class to go through four years with Clark as the principal spoke of him in her graduation speech. ""You have been our parents when they were not there. You became our friend when we didn't have any,"" she said. After giving away a video tape of the Connie Chung special he showed and a copy of a book written about him to two members of the audience, Clark closed his speech. ""Bison, you be the best of whatever you are,"" he said."
Umbrella endorses,
slate of candidates,
ROTC works to comply with uni,
versity non-discriminatory policy,"By Michael M cGandy Staff Writer Though Mark Larson '91 stated that the Department of Defense policy that bars known gay men and lesbians from enlisting in the armed forces is ""the most bla tant symbolic act of discrimination against gay, lesbian, and bi-sexual people that exists in this country,"" he admits that when it comes to the relationship between ROTC and the University's non-discriminatory Clause the issue becomes more complex. ""Right now we are exploring what the policy at R O TC is in terms o f the acceptance and participation o f gay, lesbian, and bi-sexual stu dents,"" Larson said, ""and if in the relationship between the University and R O TC there is a discrepancy, a violation of the non-discriminatory clause."" During the last academic year ""sexual orientation"" was added to the University's non-discriminatory clause which states that the Univer sity ""does not discriminate [on the basis of race, creed, etc.]...in the administration o f its educational policies, admissions policies, schol arship and loan programs, and ath letics and other University- administered programs."" Larson and members o f the Friends of Gays and Lesbians and the Gay, Lesbian, the Bucknell Progressive Caucus, and Bi-sexual Awareness Group are concerned that the Defense Department regulations that the Reserve Officers Training Corps follows may place it in viola tion of the non-discriminatory clause. In the past few years R O TC programs at other university cam puses across the country have been challenged on precisely these grounds, resulting in the severing of ties between those universities and their respective ROTC pro grams. At those schools, as is the case at Bucknell, ROTC made use of university facilities and other material support in pursuing their educational programs oriented toward military training and devel oping leadership skills. Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Mclver, director of the Susque hanna Unit of the Army R O TC, stated that ""on the surface there is a conflict, but the fact is that the Department of Defence policy does not apply to the University."" Mclver said that the classes that R O TC offers through the Univer sity are open to all students includ ing homosexuals. Rather it is at the particular moment when the student signs a contract with the Army that the policy that bars homosexuals comes into play. 'There are no restrictions on involvement in RO TC programs; there are restrictions about who we will contract as officers,"" Mclver said. "" I am under no orders to exclude people from R O TC."" It is just this issue of this split between R O TC programs and the function of commissioning offi cers, according to Larson, that is most difficult to resolve. At present he said that he was attempting to understand ""to what extent does that contract become integral to R O TC and if it is central, does that place ROTC in violation o f the nondiscriminatory clause?"" * Mclver stated that there are often people who do belong to R O TC, but do not have an interest in being commissioned officers. At present though, all of the Bucknell juniors and seniors involved in ROTC have signed contracts with the Army, and according to Department of Defence policy it is to be supposed that none of them are gay or lesbian. When questioned as to ROTC possibly being in conflict with the nondiscriminatory clause, Sojka said that his "" immediate reaction would not be to throw the rascals out."" Prefacing his com ments with the reminder that he is a molecular biologist and a bit out of his depth on this issue, Sojka stated that ""while the military can be chided for being slow, it is very clear that the military has the abil ity to significantly impact society in a positive manner"" suggesting that the military could revamp its policies in the future to include gays and lesbians. Sojka cited the financial aid that ROTC scholarships offer to Bucknell students and the impor tance of having liberally educated persons in the officers corp of the military--at present over 70% of all officers are R O TC trained-- as significant factors to consider. ""At this point I am not quick to break off our relations with the Army, but this is my personal view and not institutional policy,"" Sojka said. "" Yet there does appear to be something directly different from what we have in our nondiscrimi natory clause and I would at least like to see a better justification."" In terms of the financial aid that R O TC offers to students, Lar son agreed that a severing of ties would could prevent a number of By Andrew Cohen Staff Writer The Umbrella Organization has endorsed a slate of candidates for this Tuesday's Bucknell Stu dent Government election in the first action of its kind. The deci sion to endorse a slate of candi dates ""came out of a group discus sion because Umbrella felt that BSG had not adequately repre sented the variety of student voices on campus,"" according to Mark Larson a member of the Umbrella steering committee. Larson explained the Umbrella had problems because "" the style of leadership that has been presently operating within BSG has been a very hierarchical officer dominated leadership."" Umbrella sent a flyer to stu dents listing the slate of candi dates that they endorsed. Those candidates are Bill Lee for presi dent, Vanessa Mayo for treasurer, Megan Karekelian for first vice president, and Mare Rasmussen for second vice president. In terms of how effective the slate will be Larson said, "" It's hard to tell but I would hope that a good percentage of Umbrella would vote for the candidates."" Some of the candidates run ning were upset that they never had the chance to address Umbrella to which Larson responded, 'This is the first time, and if people were really upset with that, then we will try to repsond to that in a more fair manner"" in the future. Larson did defend the slate though, explain ing that ""at the same time we have put forward candidates who we feel very comfortable representing what Umbrella does ... And once again we're endorsing these can didates as four candidates we feel will do an excellent job, but we're not saying that everyone has to vote according to what we're saying."" Larson also defended the group against the charge of back ing single-issue candidates. ""First, we do represent a wide variety of opinions, and secondly, the type of leadership that we stress is open to all opinions."" Larson though, was unable to say how much the Umbrella candidates would be open to Greek opinions. He noted that there are Greeks in Umbrella but he also said, ""We are a consensus organization and we just haven't had that dialogue."" Umbrella has endorsed Bill Lee for president, Megan Karake- lian for first vice-president, Mare Rasmussen for second vice- president, and Vanessa Mayo for treasurer."
Student activism,
increasing nationally,"students from attending the University. "" Obviously there would be a loss of scholarships, especially for students from working-class back grounds,"" Larson said. ""Yet, we would hope that the University would maintain its commitment to diversity on this campus by increas ing scholarships to these people."" The Department of Defense's rationale, as Mclver understands it, is that homosexuality its incompati ble with military service. ""This pol icy has not come under much scru tiny,"" according to Mclver, ""court challenges have been like the most recent one involving Staff Sergeant Watkins-- they did not address the policy itself, but only the consis tency with which it was applied. (Staff Sergeant Watkins, in a recent Supreme Court Decision, was approved for re-enlistment after the Court found that the Army had once approved his re- enlistment despite the fact that they knew him to be gay. As a result the Court declared the Army's attempt in 1982 to bar his re-enlistment on the grounds of inconsistency.) Mclver stated that his own position on this issue was that a gay man or lesbian could serve the mili tary honorably and that unknown to the military many already have. In the next few months, Mclver said, the General Accounting Office would be examining the Depart ment of Defence's policy, but he does not share Sojka's optimism about the future. ""The climate in the military is an interactive one and there is room for dissent"" Mclver said, ""but See R O T C , page 8 By Andrew Cohen Staff Writer ""We believe the recent era of student self-preoccupation, which began in the middle 1970's with the end of the Vietnam War, is drawing to a close. Students appear to be making the transition to a period of social engagement,"" wrote Arthur Levine, chair of the Institute for Educational Management in Har vard's School of Education, and Deborah Hirsch, former assistant to the president of Bradford College in The Chronical of Higher Educa tion, November 7,1990. Levine and Hirsch concluded that college ""students have fol lowed a cyclical pattern, oscillating back and forth between personal preoccupation and social engage ment."" The three previous cycles this century were determined by the occurrence of World Wars I and II, and Vietnam. 'These were times in which the activism and campus unrest of the Progressive Era, the Depression, and the 1960's gave way to self-improvement crazes in the 1920's; panty raids, telephone booth stuffing, and general disinter est in the 'silent generation' of the 1950's; and streaking, toga parties, and yuppieism in the 1970's and 1980's."" Levine and Hirsch believe that students are moving into an activist stage because of twelve years of research in which they have tracked the attitudes of stu dents at 20 colleges and universi ties. They cite a more optimistic view of the ""collective future,"" an increase in college heroes, a socially oriented job market, and an increase in social action (including volunteerism and protest), as evi dence that college students are repeating the cycles seen in the 1920's, late 1930's, and 1960's and early 1970's. Levine and Hirsch character ize the late 1970's and 1980's as a period of self absorption. "" Social activity increases, including emm- bership in fraternities and alcohol consumption. The intellectual orientation of students decreases, church attendance increases, and material concerns about issues like job security and home ownership rise greatly."" This new period college stu dents are said to be entering will see a shift in the salient issues. ""In the next few years, then, we can expect to see a revival of political activism on campus and more stu dent interest in the 'relevance' of college courses. We should also expect students to be more con cerned about international and social issues and in campus governance."" Levine and Hirsch stressed that the reaction of institutions to new student views on curricula, social opportunities, university pol icy, and univeristy values will be essential in the years to come. "" It is important for colleges and universi ties to recognize now how students are changing. Historically, cam puses have been slow to perceive such changes and even slower to respond to them. The result has been that institutions have had to contend not only with student acti vism but also with a great deal of student anger."" This trend appears to be true for Bucknell as recent concern over U .S. involvment in the Gulf (see related story page 1), curriculum (see related story page 1), and BSG elections (see related story page 3) clearly shows."

Leaders ask for,
special session,"Congressional leaders from both parties urged President Bush Tuesday to convene a special ses sion on the Persian Gulf crisis, as the Administration confronted increasing concerns about a Middle East war. The White House was opposed to the special session, say ing that it would undermine Bush's strategy. Senator Richard Lugar, rank ing Republican on the Senate For eign Relations Committee, said the President's near doubling of troops in the gulf region ""has set the United States on a collision course in which Iraq will either withdraw from Kuwait or be forced to do so by military means."" Some Democrats who favored a special session hoped to limit the President's ability to com mit troops to war. Senator Edward Kennedy, Democrat from Massa chusetts, said the United States is on a ""headlong course toward war"" and said, ""Silence by Congress now is an abdication of our constitu tional responsibility and an acquies cence in war."" George Mitchell, the Senate majority leader, voiced his con cerns, saying that the President ""has no legal authority, none what soever"" to order an offensive attack against Iraq."
Thatcher faces,
leadership fight,"Sir Geoffrey Howe,^former deputy prime minister, challenged Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in his first speech before Parlia ment since resigning November 1, by delivering a stinging attack on her opposition to greater economic and political integration of Europe. Howe did not rule out the possibility that he may challenge Thatcher as leader of the Conserva tive Party and Prime Minister, but he seemed to suggest that this move was for others to make. Howe resigned following a European Community summit meeting in Rome, where leaders of the 11 member nations agreed to try to proceed rapidly toward the creation of a central bank and a common currency. Thatcher ridi culed and rejected that goal."
Yeltsin fights,
new union plan,"President Boris Yeltsin of Russia announced Monday that he was rebuffing attempts by Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev to draft a new union treaty before deciding such issues as control over diamonds, petroleum, banking, and other economic resources. Negotiations between Yeltsin and Gorbachev signaled that the Kremlin is ready to create a new union treaty which would allow the nation's 15 republics greater sove reignty that they are demanding, while still preserving a viable national government. Yeltsin rejected the Krem lin's attempts to ensure that ""for the time being"" the disputed economic resources ""would lie within the center's competence."" Russia, the richest republic in natural resources, wants to exploit them for its benefit while limiting the tradi tional power of the national government."

In one example a director of the Federal Home Loan Bank in Dallas, who was also a savings executive, received a $1.5 million mortgage loan from a troubled institution at the same time that local examiners were being ""influ enced improperly by senior offi cials"" of the home loan bank. According to reviews con ducted from 1986 to 1989 by out side government examiners at 10 districts of the Federal Home Loan bank system, documents show that senior regulators at the bank board knew that in three of the larger dis tricts ""losses were deliberately con cealed by the thrifts with the approval"" of local examiners."

With this last hurdle cleared, Dr. Steven A. Rosenberg of the National Cancer Institute, head researcher for the project, plans to begin testing the therapy on three cancer patients suffering from met astatic melanoma, a deadly skin malignancy that resists virtually all conventional forms of treatment, like chemotherapy and radiation. Without the experimental treat ment, the patients are expected to live no longer than two or three months. Rosenberg said that he is ""chomping at the bit to get started on this."""

Curriculum,"From page 1 into the curriculum. Can we tell them that we have made a commit ment to do that?' And the General Education Council said 'yes, this in some form will be part of our pro posed general education program'."" The need for students to ven ture outside their worlds at to obtain a well-rounded education, necessitates the Council's proposal, according to Gerdes. The proposal is ""something which meets our mis sion as an institution, and to ade quately prepare for the world out side the Bucknell bubble,"" said Gerdes. Although the Council has proposed several ways to increase students' perspective, the freshmen foundation seminars lie at its core. Gerdes defined these seminars as ""..a pilot program right now but one which we hope to recommend as a program for all freshmen. As instructors design those courses they have to build in multiple per spectives in the same topic. Some times, the way they do that[increase perspective] in this course isn't going to be directly related to race, gender and multicutlure areas because they might say that you can learn to take different perspec tives on the same topic. But the intellectual skill is the same --it is saying there's not just one way of looking at it"" The pilot program is basi cally a test of the criteria that the Education Council has outlined. By implementing a smaller number of seminars, they feel it will allow them to make revisions until the whole proposal can eventually go forward, and become widespread. If the foundation seminars are lim ited to a size of fifteen, Gerdes esti mates that it would take about forty-five seminars for a typical freshman class in the College of Arts and Sciences and about fifty- seven, if the College of Engineer ing were included.[these numbers are for the average class size at Bucknell. The Class Of '94, for instance, has a higher proportion of Engineers and would probably require closer to 47 seminars.] The Council's criteria for foundation seminars espouse three basic values: active learning, con sciousness raising, and the develop ment of library and computer skills. They focus on interdisciplinary top ics, which are somewhat revealed by their course titles --""Religion and Ecology,"" and ""Fiction, Drama, and Film,"" for example. In all, eighteen freshmen seminars, or ""pilot courses,"" are being offered this semester. Yet, Jackson Hill, associate dean of Arts and Sciences, said ""The pilot courses that exist now arc not necessarily what these courses are going to be. Foundation Seminars will come to reflect what the overall consensus shows they should reflect. This is an evolution ary process. Nothing is engraved in stone."" Don't be surprised, however, is some of these 'new' Freshmen Foundation Seminars sound famil iar. For some seminars are actually the same courses which have been offered during the past three years. ""The Many Worlds of Women,"" for instance, appears on this fall's course listing but was also offered in 1989 and 1986. Another course, ""Accommodating Error,"" was also offered in 1987 and in 1986. While some courses are totally different, some seminars are the same courses that have been redesigned. ""They have all under gone some transformation or evolu tion,"" Hill explained. Hill said ""the foundation seminars are broader in concept that the Freshmen Advisor Seminar(FAS), as originally defined, was. The foundation seminars, attempts to broaden the goals of FAS. The older seminars didn't have to meet the goals of the foun dation seminars...these goals were not part of the coterie"". ""The terms of the petition are very amenable to the outlook of the council itself,"" according to Hill, and the terms reenforce the council's own ideas. Ironically, the committee who drafted this petition does not view the Council's goals as amenable to their own. ""Obviously, Bucknell is set up to limit student input,"" said Ste phen Leshinski '91, a member of this petition committee. ""You have over 1300 people sign a petition and how many of those people have had an input in curriculum changes? You have a group of stu dents here who represent one-half, one-third, or one-fourth of the stu dents who worked on putting that petition together, and how many of us knew that a group was doing that and what was going on? That's not a criticism of the people, that's a criticism of the way it is set up."" The aims of the petition, according to its members, were two-fold. First, it sought to create an environment of cultural diversity by expanding the curriculum. Sec ondly, the petition was intended to show that there were a group of stu dents who wanted to directly get involved in that process. The com mittee agrees that the University has failed in achieving this latter goal; that is, in not including any of the students who wished to be included. Another committee member said ""The General Education Coun cil turned to the Bucknell Student Government to provide them with two student representatives, and the BSG provided them, whereas it would have been more wise to turn to the entire campus, to turn to other groups. The BSG does n.ot represent the student body; it repre sents a portion of the student body. Hill explained that the Edu cation Council's process of exclud ing these groups was not due to ""any lack of desire to have those discussions"" but rather, due to time constraints by the Council to get things done. Hill, said that a ""broader network of opinion"" is not part of the University's structure, and he suggested that perhaps Charlotte Weddle, associate vice- president for student life, address this communication gap. Nonetheless, a verbal com munication between students and the Council will begin on Novem ber 28, when Professor Elaine Gar rett, the Chair of the General Edu cation Council, meets with this student committee. Also, on December 4, the committee is invited to the Education Council's meeting."
Petition urging a,
diverse curriculum,"Editor's Note: The following petition was distributed last April and was signed by about 1300 students. In May, the students then handed their petition to the dean's office. We, the undersigned, strongly urge the administration and faculty to implement the following policies for the 1991/92 academic year in order to develop the University's campaign for cultural diversity: 1) With student input, develop a program to be incorporated within the University's distributional humanities, social science, and natural science requirements that encompasses non-Western, African- American, Women's Jewish, and Gay/Lesbian/Bisexual studies, begin ning with the incoming first year students of Fall 1991. 2) Add more courses to the curriculum in non-Westem, African- American, Women's, Jewish, and Gay/Lesbian/Bisexual Studies by the 1991/92 academic year. 3) Hire an adequate number of faculty who have expertise in non-Westem, African-American, Women's, Jewish, and Gay/Lesbian/ Bisexual Studies by the 1991/92 academic year. These new faculty members need to be placed in tenure-track positions. 4) All members of faculty, staff, and administration need to be strongly encouraged to attend biannual seminars or workshops aimed at increasing their sensitivity and awareness about race, gender, class, sexual orientation, religious beliefs, and ethnicity. 5) The University must provide the proper funding for the afore mentioned policies."
STOP --,"From page 1 According to Larson, the group already has opposition. A phone call to the Langone Center Office described the grave display as ""un-American."" But Larson responded, ""If America is supposed to be a democracy and a free soci ety, it's not only our right but our duty to stand for what we believe in."" STOP has several events planned for the coming week. Fri day Nov. 16 will feature classroom discussions all day. There will be a ""Teach In"" Saturday from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. at the LC Forum. Sunday there will be a Candlelight Vigil at 4:45 p.m. at Rooke Chapel. On Monday there will be a ""Speak Out"" at 11:45 a.m. on the uphill side of the Langone Center."

Bucknellian,page 6 Editor $ note: The candidates for BSG executive offices were interviewed by members of the Bucknellian staff on Tuesday. Candidates for each office were asked a series of questions. The questions were not available to the candidates prior to the interview.
Candidates for president,
Bill Lee 93,"Experience: ""i was student body president of my high school... and one of the hardest thing for me was to be fair with different student organi zations. I think I can bring that experience into the BSG. I know there's been a problem this year of impartiality and voicing differ ent student organization. I like to be fair and just in the way BSG makes decisions for the student body."" ""I'd like to make BSG a liaison between student body and the administration."" Goals: ""The way the BSG is currently structured on campus, it's kind of like a triangle with the BSG officers on top, the congress men in the middle, and the stu dent body on the bottom. I see a problem with that. BSG needs to be an organization that sup ports student voices, different organizations, and try to push ^hat within the University and 'the administration."" ""Also, I'd like to get"
BSG,"involved in more student activi ties and student organizations on campus by trying to repre sent every organization on cam pus, maybe send congressmen to their meetings, see and find out what they're about, so we can make a fair judgement on them during appropriations and other times we have to make a judgement on any student organization."" Student apathy/ communication with administration: ""The word apathy is used a lot, and I think that's wrong because you're kind of blaming the stu dents and saying that they're apathetic about certain things. I think it has to do with involve ment and enthusiasm and that . has to do with the different stu dent leaders at Bucknell."" ""I'd like to set BSG up so we can meet formally with adminis tration more often than we have this year and the years before. The administration says one thing and then they present another and that's where stu dents feel they're powerless. ?Students do have a voice on campus, and I want every stu dent to express it. We have to provide a place and a time for them to do that."" Salient issues: : ""Students are obviously unsatis fied with the alcohol policy, but I don't think is the most important ' issue. I think that issue derives from lack of social functions beside the Greek system. Stu dents really don't have a place to turn to beside the fraternity ## and sorority parties. The univer- , sity says they will provide more, ' but I don't see it happening, ; unless this new Bison is going to provide every function people ' can attend."" % | ""| also see Bucknell students # graduating, doing fine with their IGPA and their major, but I don't I think they're intellectual in terms of what's going on around the world. I'd like to build a commu nity where people are more intellectual in what's going on in the world. The student government needs to bring that up on campus, bring up issues for people do debate, learn about different issues, and be educated."" Why running: ""I feel like I can change a lot of things on campus. To me this is a challenge. I have to work with the town, the administration, the students, and bring them all together. I'd like to bring the BSG back to what the Hand book says it should be: to repre sent all aspects of student life.' I don't think it's doing that."
I,"think it should be fair, bring jus tice into the school, and increase participation."""
y 7,
Alex Sherer '93,"Experience: ""I've been on BSG since first semester freshman year; this semester I've worked closely with the current president, I've been attending the executive meeting weekly; Also I'm spear heading a committee which i s developing a student evaluation booklet of the professors which should be coming out next semester for first semester next year. I'm also on the appropria tions committee. I have experi ence in all facets of BSG."
I,"think it's very important as presi dent to have prior experience before taking office. I also am extremely aware of the commit tees around BSG. I do have a lot of experience with BSG currently."" Goals: ""One of the biggest things is the social situation at Bucknell, and I don't mean just Greek. I think a big problem with the BSG is that many students are really unaware of what the BSG does. I think that was evident in the situation with the appropriations committee... I think it was just a lack of communication."" ""I would like to have more pub licity given to the BSG, and I'd like to invite the heads of vari ous groups on campus [to attend BSG meetings]."" ""I'd like to maybe to hold forums if certain topics came up and just raise campus awareness."" ""I would like to work with the administration and the students and the heads of organizations and work out a plan of action."" Student morale/ communication with administration: ""I think there is a low morale due to students unhappiness with some of the rules, but I also think it's just a lack of communi cation in general and if the stu dents are aware of what's going on and what groups are doing what they can become better involved and if the students and the administration work together I think that's important."" Salient issues: ""Morale is obviously a major"
Questions to all Candidates:,
"* If elected, what experience will you bring to your office?",
* What are your goals for your term in office?,
"* In light of the recent student morale problems on campus, how will",
you work to facilitate communication between the BSG and the,
administration?,
* What do you see as the most salient issues facing the student body,
and how will you move to address them?,
* Why are you running?,
"For the candidates for treasurer, the third question above was replaced by",
the following:,
* How will you work to ensure the appropriations process is fair and,
equitable?,"ings are open, I think that's the know some of the functions of Salient Issues: biggest problem we're facing the administrative side of now: a bridae of the com- Bucknell."" problem, the unhappiness with the Act 31 reforms and related issues, one recurring theme is the parking situation, which isn't a top priority but does deserve some attention."" ""Unrest with the social reforms is apparently the most pressing issue on campus."" Why running: ""I have involvement with the BSG, and I think it's important to get someone on there who has experience before hand. I cer tainly have certain goals that I'd like to see put into effect."" ""By running for this position I can hopefully get an upward trend, raise morale, and hope fully put into effect certain reforms that the students would like to see."""
Candidate for first,
vice president,
Megan Karakelian '93,"Experience: ""I've been a part of a lot of differ ent activities and a lot of differ ent groups on campus."
I,"haven't worked directly with the student government before, except through the lectureship committee and the concert com mittee which I'm on. I've worked with various sports teams and the dance company."" ""And I've kind of had a well- rounded view of how different organizations and different fac ets of Bucknell work."" ""I've had leadership positions before, never at Bucknell directly, but I think I can give a lot do it."" Goals: ""I'd like to work with Joey [Krak- off, current 1st vice-president] to continue what he's done as far as elections. Personally I'd like to make BSG more reachable for the students. I want some how to work with the others who will be the new officers and try to make it easier for everyone else at Bucknell to get in touch and use BSG for themselves."" ""I don't think that a lot of people know that Bucknell and BSG should be together, and every one here is a part of it."" Student morale/ communication with administration: ""I can't personally say all the answers right now, but I think a lot of it has to do with the teach ers too; if we could work with the teachers to try to reach the students. Also let the students know that the teachers are reachable."" ""Hopefully by inviting the admin istration to more meetings with students and having individual groups invite the administration in and talking to them...if the stu dents could deal directly with the administration it would help a lot."" ""It may put pressure on the administration to try to under stand that the students are talk ing about, and it might give the students a better idea of what the administration is going through, and how difficult it is for them to stand on that thin line."" ""The most important issue in my eyes is the diversity here. It's a very group-oriented campus; it's not integrated at all. I think that's a problem. It doesn't seem like there's many courses focused on African studies, or studies of foreign people, there's not a lot of cultural studies..."" ""To learn about all the issues that seem so far from us at Bucknell."" Why running: ""I used to always get involved student government, and I enjoy it a lot. I enjoy talking with stu dents, I enjoy dealing with the administrators and professors, and I'm starting to become more active in more groups oriented towards the problems I talked about with the diversity..."" ""I think there's a lot that can be done. I've been getting a feel for hoyv everyone else thinks and I really want to be a part of trying to mold Bucknell and try ing to work to make the student government more of an outlet for the students."""
Candidates for sec,
ond vice president,
Chris Zacharda '93,"Experience: ""With leadership skills, I'm cur rently in the pilot program of the emerging leaders. I'm currently a congressman on BSG, which would definitely help because I've seen how it works, I've seen the job of second vice president, what the current second vice president does. I see her time constraints, the things she's devoted to, and thing like that."" ""I've had leadership roles in my fraternity and in the inter fraternity council, I'm a pre-law major, I'm very into politics, I like the legal aspects of issues, and I think I'd be able to draw from that."" Goals: ""Since the office of second vice president is largely correspon dence, one way I think I could improve the entire output of Bucknell Student Government would be to definitely improve communications between the students and the organization that his there for the students."" ""Posting things such as the min utes of the meetings, things to be voted on, things to be dis cussed, agendas., making them more public to the students, I think that would largely help break the communication gap, making sure the know our meet- munication gap would help."" Student morale/ communication with administration: ""Since the student government is a liaison between the stu dents and the administration being put on the executive coun cil of BSG would give even more of a position to confront with administration."" ""With me really being in favor of bridging the communication gap it would definitely help to inform that administration of the stu dents' needs, and also being the secretarial liaison between the government and the administra tion I would definitely from a per sonal point of view, I would be able to know exactly what was going on."" Salient issues: ""Communication is definitely a big problem, and combating the communication problem could also help alleviate other prob lems such as student morale."" ""I really don't think administra tion is aware of any problems that the students have, so that's another thing that BSG could do."" 'The chalk talk issue, that was rather highly debated, definitely brought more attention to the students on the issue. We're also trying to have more BSG members sit on other commit tees, and have other commit tees have individuals go to BSG meetings, which would make the communication lines between the specific organiza tions and the government much more efficient."" Why running: ""Originally"
I,"was running because I was afraid of the apa thy that the students were facing and that they were displaying by not having anyone run."" ""I really feel the need to bridge the communication gap, and I feel that being the second vice president would be a major role in that gap. Especially, I felt that sitting on the executive council and being a liaison to adminis tration more specifically than representatives that"
I,"could probably make even more of a difference."""
Mare Rasmussen '93,"Experience: ""I'm serving on the committee on women's leadership, so I've worked with the staff of OSA, and some of the administrators, namely Mary Dorsey, so I do ""I am also the chairperson for the committee on logistics for the women's leadership confer ence that we are holding in the spring."" ""I'm not sure that I really have like 'experience' that would apply to this position."" ""I know that I do have a of of enthusiasm and I would like to do my best for the students."" Goals: ""I'd like to bring BSG back to the students. Yeah, sure, people know that BSG is the Bucknell Student Government, but they don't know that it does actually have a huge impact on life here at Bucknell."" ""I think the function of BSG should be what the students want it to be, and if there's any way I can help... I think that's what I'd like to do."" Student morale/ communication with administration: ""Well I know that the BSG has tried before to have liaison offi cers between the congress and the different organizations on campus. And apparently that hasn't worked."" ""I think it's congress' duty to get to know what the students want and I'm not exactly sure how do to that except maybe possibly through just increasing student participation in government."" Salient issues: ""I guess it all ties into Morale in a way, and then there's the whole Greek situation, which gets turned into the alcohol situ ation when it should just be the way the student body is assembled."" Why running: 'To be honest with you, I'm not sure. I know that I want to do something for Bucknell."
I,"thought that if I could run for second vice president in a role that was vague I could try to turn it into something that might not be so vague, and maybe do something for the apathy, morale, and separatism and stu dent participation, etc."""

Candidates for,
treasurer,
Dave Fries '93,"Experience: ""BSG congressman for the past two years. During that time I spent 1 semester as special assistant to the president, 1 semester as special assistant to the treasurer. Last semester I served on the executive commit tee and this semester I served on appropriations; appropria tions being a key in terms of being treasurer mostly because I got to see the questions the actual probing that the current treasurer went through in terms of giving out money."" Goals: ""As treasurer, it would be ideal for me to get an appropriations committee that's very diversi fied. I'd want many multi-culture students on the committee, men and women, people from different clubs, so that there aren't any biases."" ""I foresee myself being an impartial leader, and a prober, going through policies like probed allocation, making sure you know where the money goes. You don't want to be a big miser with it, but on the other hand frivolity I don't think is what you want to do either. Because it is the students' money and they have the right to know where it goes, nothing should be funded just so some one else can have a really good time."" 'The treasurer has a voice on the executive committee. Basi cally when you have your exec utive committee meetings twice a week the treasurer is seen as an equal; he doesn't have to stay just with monetary policy but he's someone who can shed light on pretty much anything."" Fairness in appropriations: ""In terms of improvement just to get a more diversified commit tee so that no one could actually accuse you of something like that. I think that's key here; you're able to cover yourself a little."" ""It also brings in different voices. If we don't have any multi culture students on the appropri ations committee right now, and I don't believe we do, you don't get to hear the pros and cons of why funding should go to some thing like that because no one else can draw upon it and say 'yeah, I went to that event last year and it was really worth while, I think we should help fund it again this year.'"" ""Another thing is that, for some of the groups that come in, their budgets aren't done properly. You have to give out proper guidelines. Some groups will come in and want twenty-three hundred dollars and only end up getting a hundred and it's not because we don't like them... It's just because they're so neb ulous in what they write down. They say 'conference with lec turer, $1500' but they don't have a speaker yet, they don't' have a place yet, but they need the money up front. We just can't give that money out up front."" Salient Issues: 1 see morale as a pretty salient issue. I think it's getting better. I don't think the students are def initely wholly at fault, nor is the administration. I guess in terms of morale I see the relaxing of social rules helping out, Vince DeCerchio coming in and seem ing to take a more hands-off approach in his governing of par ties and allowing fraternities to basically govern themselves."" ""Other problems more specific to my job is appropriations where a lot of groups feel that they're get ting the shaft somehow and so I'd like to see the appropriations become more diversified so peo ple not only wouldn't have that complaint, but that maybe we'd be able to allocate more If we knew what it's for. I think ignor ance may have a lot to do with why some of these clubs aren't getting money, just because the people on the committee right now don't know and aren't sure about why we should give money to certain events because they haven't gone through it. If someone were there on the committee that could help us out and tell us more about the event we might be more willing to hand money out."" Why running: ""I'm running because I want to be that person, I guess. The impartial leader to appropria tions. I think I can do it, I've been special assistant to the treasurer, it seems like fun."" ""I'd like to ask the probing ques tions. Ask them if they should charge dues... I see it as a job that I'd like to take on. Being in congress the last two years, I've seen the previous treasur ers, and it looks like a job I'd enjoy."" nell. I think a lot of it has to do with groups not understanding how to ask for money, what they should be asking for."" ""I'd like to make it a lot easier for treasurers of clubs, and the student body to know where their money is going."" Why running: ""I think there's a lot of potential for BSG to do a lot on this cam pus, and I know they've been trying. I guess I just want to continue trying to get BSG more involved with the students and get the students to know more about it. I think a lot of people are screaming about community right now and that we have none, and I'd like to help do something about that and I think the best way is through BSG."" Fairness in appropriations: ""I think it's important that there should be someone groups could go to to voice their aggra vations with appropriations."
I,"think there should be someone who's not involved directly with the appropriations system who could have an unbiased view of what's happening."" Salient issues: ""I think community is a big prob lem right now. Students donl feel like they have the power to get anything done, and I think that leads to the problem of community. Most students who come to Bucknell have had leadership positions and have been involved before they come here and for some rea son when they get here that all falls apart and they lose all interest in being involved."
I,"don't think that's a problem with all the students who come here; I would have to say it's a problem in the system. I'd like to try to figure out what that problem is."""
Vanessa Mayo '93,"Experience: ""Well, I'm treasurer for two clubs at the moment, so I've had some experience this semester working with appro priations. I have a pretty good understanding of how"

ROTC,"From page 3 it is not evident to me that we will see a change in that policy any time soon."" Until that time when there is a change in policy Mclver said that he was bound to separate any student contacted to the Army through R O TC if he finds him or her to be homosexual. At other universities such as MIT, Tufts, and Brown, students engaged in protests against R O TC's connection with their insti tutions which resulted in these uni versities separating themselves from their respective R O TC pro grams. Larson stated that the group of students examining these issues were not that far along yet. "" I don't think we are at the point to ask the question of whether ROTC should be phased out, but at the same time we are not going to limit our options,"" Larson said. ""As a committee we stand for the rights of gay, lesbian, and bi-sexual stu dents and we will not back down from that."" Sojka said that at present the University's legal counsel, Elias Abelson, had not been asked to begin work on this issue. Bar bara Shailor, the University's affir mative action officer, has begun to look at relevent materials, accord ing to Sojka, in the event that there is an uproar over the RO TC issue any time soon. As of yet, though, the University does not have a firm stance on how it understands its relationship to ROTC. Larson stated that in orga nizing this examination of the ROTC policy involving gays and lesbians he was not making any statement concerning the ROTC program itself or the military. ""Our goal,"" Larson said, ""is to make Bucknell a safe environment for students of all sexual orientations so that all students can feel comfort able being themselves and there is no need to hide a part of themselves."""

Bison Tales,"By M arc Haimes Staff Writer Here at Bucknell, clothing has different levels of cleanliness. There are the level one (desirable) clothes which are so ""neat"" , ""clean"" , and well....''morning fresh"" that the little cuddly teddy bear from that fabric softener commercial (named Cutsie or Snuggly or something like that) will spend playful hours frolicking amongst your sweatshirts and letting out heart warming-giggles while he announces how soft and wonderful he thinks your clothing is. (By the way, is it true that that for just 40 bucks and 23 proof of purchases, you can own a genuine imitation of that lovable bear? Oh boy!) People usu ally wear level one clothes on tough days of lab because it is some what less depressing to face a 7 hour dissection knowing that at least your clothes don't smell of formaldehyde.. .  yet Then (after 17 or 18 uses) there is level ten. Although these fetid mounds may at one time have been ""sparkling clean"" , now they have started to develop a strange decaying odor and seem to resist slightly when you pull them from the floor. However, you can still use this clothing provided you put on lots of cologne and possess a spatula to scrape the outfit off your body at the end of the day. After you have abused all your pants, shirts, and socks a number of times at level 10, (and they have developed a stench that would make Snuggly want to drown himself in a big vat of Wisk) you can then reluctantly toss everything into the hamper where it chemically bonds together and develops into a fab ric-based life form with a primitive digestive system capable of con suming. . .  stuffed bears that like to frolic amongst sweatshirts. When it looks like your clothing supply has been exhausted do not despair. There a number of people on this campus who are selling high quality event-oriented tee-shirts which display artistic and origi nal designs. My favorite are the fraternity ""theme party"" shirts that depict lovable and popular comic strip characters (like Charlie Brown) chugging beer, funnelling margaritas, and generally passing out at their favorite places to party. For the past week, my two ""theme party"" shirts have become the highlight of my wardrobe (along with the jeans rapidly approaching level 27) however, I am relatively unconcerned about this, because in just 4 days I will be wrestling the fearsome pile into a pillow-case and heading home for Thanksgiving break with some special surprises for mom and dad to wash and fold. Actually, I don't know why I'm so excited about Thanksgiving holiday. Last year, it seemed that my newfound college worldliness and wisdom effected my ability to communicate with relatives who had come up to visit. I noticed this during my first conversation with my great aunt... Blanche: (rushing up to me) oyyyyy my little baby come here and tell your Aunt all about college! M e: (flinching as I receive a lip-stick soaked kiss on the cheek) Hi Aunt Blanche, how are you, it's been such a ... Blanche: (reproachfully) Honey, why are you wearing a shirt that shows Snoopy vomiting on Woodstock? Me: Well, I was like 'scoping' . . . 'yeah sc ope' ....but I had like 'bagel' to wear so I felt like 'booting' cause I wasn't gone a 'scrag' so I 'sleazed' it for ten bucks. Eeeeeeeeeeewah! Blanche: That's nice honey...Have your bowels been troubling you? After assuring Aunt Blanche that my bowels really were fine, and promising her I'd notify her know if there was any change in their status, I headed downstairs to greet my two younger cousins. Jay was in fourth grade and Jonathon was in sixth. My most recent memories of these two were from four years ago when Jonathon would quietly play with his He-Man doll and Jay enjoyed singing adorable songs from his first-grade class. I was surprised to note just how much my cute little cousins had changed... M e: Hey guys! Remember Me?!? Ya Wanna play Transformers orGo-Bots?!? Jonathon: Dude, are you a virgin? Me: Hey, maybe we can build forts!...or do a water gun fight!...or roll down the hill!...or jump on the couch! I know! We can watch ""The Little Mermaid!"" I'll bet Jay knows all the songs! Jay: What kind of condoms do you use, man? M e : ......... You mean there's a difference? Jonathon: Sit down dude, we'll explain... That night I curled up in fetal position and clutched my teddy bear, 'Snuggly' ... he was a bargain. v _____ _________________________________________________________________________________ )"

Among the most common items found were calculators, batter ies, Kleenex, staplers, and assorted pens and pencils. (One student claimed to have 24 pens in his bag). Some more uncommon items found stashed in students' bags were: * Three tangerines * A  Mickey Mouse lollipop * A  Grolsch bottle top * Pieces of a letter * A  yellow balloon * Two dictionaries * A  key to an apartment in Louisiana that belonged to an old friend who doesn't live there anymore. * Back issues of What's Happening?"

"..,",
Cross your fingers and vote,"In an attempt to elucidate the issues and reduce the popularity aspect of the Bucknell Student Government (BSG) elections process. The Bucknellian's editorial board decided to interview and endorse candidates this semester. While the board is generally disappointed with the quality and quantity of candidates running for office, we feel that the following candidates will push the BSG into a strong role on campus while best representing the entire student body. President Alex Sherer '93 will bring a wealth of experience to the executive board of the B SG . Having been a con gressman for the past year and special assistant to current BSG President Dave Skena '92 this semester, Sherer knows the methods, both good and bad, of BSG. Sherer admits to the obvious problems with the appropriations process, and will swiftly move to address them. He also recognizes the rift of communication between the student body and B SG  --  a rift that he believes must be bridged. First Vice President Megan Karakclian '93 will bring diversity to BSG. Having been involved in a wide variety of activities at Bucknell, Karakelian's focus is on creating a more diverse Bucknell. She sees curriculum changes, a new role for BSG in activism and communication as key aspects of the new executive board. Karakelian, like Sherer, believes that the BSG must become more reachable. B SG , she asserts, must return to the student body and be truly representative. Second Vice President Chris Zaeharda '93 has demonstrated that he does what is in the students' best interest. Having held the position of congressman, Zaeharda understands the sometimes obscure processes and procedures of student gov ernment. He believes strongly in honest government, and wants to see a new, revitalized B SG  that "" is in tune with the feelings of students."" Zaeharda has a firm grasp on the most important issues, and has proven that he is conemed with both an honest and representative BSG. Treasurer Dave Fries '93 will be an invaluable asset to both students and the executive board of B SG . A stellar candi date, Fries possesses the intellectual ability, integrity and pure energy necessary for an effective student govern ment. As special assistant to current Treasurer Scott Searle '92, Fries has recognized both the shortcomings and good aspects of the current appropriations process. Fries, unlike other candidates, has formulated a valid platform and plan of attack. He will move to imple ment a fair and equitable appropriations process, while evaluating other, larger aspects of B SG  which he feels need reform. Fries is the most promising candidate running for office, and is the most stongly endorsed of all o f the dates. candidates"
Troops need our support,"To the Editor: As more troops are being deployed to the Middle East and the threat of war is imminent, the whispers of dissent are growing louder. Students on campus are distributing gold ribbons in sup port of S.T.O.P. (Students and Teachers Organizing for Peace), and displaying mock grave sites for the soldiers who have died as a result of training mission accidents. Our presence in the Gulf is not simply a matter of how much oil we have to use. If Saddam Hussein controls oil, then he con trols the world's economy. If he controls the world's economy, then he will control us politically, which would effect our everyday lives and our personal freedom that we Americans have enjoyed for over 200 years. Saddam Hussein would like to emerge as an Arab world leader; thus, controlling oil and the Arab nations. He then would have a greater power base than the United States and the Soviet Union, the world leaders today. The danger of Hussein being on a par with the world leaders is that he knows only to ""rule by the sword"". Everyone of the Arab states, whether monarchial, secu lar, or religious, has come to power through blood. Iraq does not have the constitutional framework that constrains a ruthless leader. Huss ein controlling oil threatens our lives. Iraq is a country tribal in nature because they've needed to survive in the desert for thousands of years. They live by the philoso phy, "" rule or die"" ; one man triumphs while the other weeps. Hussein acts as a tribal leader when he tries to pull the Arab nations together for a common cause. He behaves like a brutal dic tator when he kills his own people, putting one Arab against another. Hussein is also perceived as a modernizing president when he provides new technology-- schools, hospitals, roads, buildings, etc. -- in the growing cities of Iraq. Depending on which role is most important to survive and be in power, Saddam Hussein will move cleverly and comfortably between any of the three. President Bush has sent troops to the Middle East to oppose further aggression and in defense of oil, which in the hands of Hussein would cripple the world's economy. We must sup port Bush and the men and women of Operation Desert Shield. These men and women need to know that America is behind them. Quoting a Marine Captain in the Persian G ulf in a letter to his brother back home: ""Tell eve ryone who cares that everyone out here appreciates all the sup port. I can honestly say that one of the prime reasons most people are enduring out here is because everyone at home supports us. It's the only known quantity that keeps you going when the end is an unknown and not in sight. Without public support, visible public support, morale out here would collapse and this whole thing would get very ugly very fast."" Janelle E . Oltorik '93 November 14,1990"

S.T.O.P. protests US actions,"To the Editor: The organization S.T.O.P. (Students and Teachers Organized for Peace) constructed a mock memorial cemetery uphill of the Langone Center earlier this week. We are mourning the loss of fifty- four American soldiers already killed last week in the Persian Gulf. These soldiers were killed not in combat, but in accidents and routine drills being performed as a part of the United States' role in this region. Presumably these soldiers would still be alive if they were not in the Persian Gulf. In the upcoming weeks, possibly days, unless wide spread national and international resistance is expressed, many more people will die. As you walked by the tomb stones, did you laugh? Did you think it was a joke? Did you feel horror? Were you angered by the challenge to the United States' actions? Did you feel sorrow? Were you relieved to know resistance to military involvement in the Gulf does exist? Did you know that fifty-four people had really died? Fifty-four families in the United States are feeling the pain of struggling with this loss, for what? You should think about these people-- the peo ple who knew them think about them every day because they are dead. Is it worth it to you to lose a brother, father, sister, son, daughter? Did you feel anything? You should have. Are you prepared to lose your own life? That tombstone could belong to you next November, or even ear lier. Many Bucknell students do not know that it is very possible you may die should the United States become a leading player in an war with Iraq. Whether a war against Iraq becomes another Vietnam or a far worse war in terms of losses, the potential for another draft does exist In 1971 the Congress amended the draft eliminating past deferments for college men. The 1971 Amendment to the Military Selective Service Act, section 456 "" Deferments and exemptions from training and service"" was amended as follows: ""Any person who while satis factorily pursuing a full-time course of instruction at a college, univer sity, or similar institution is ordered"
Chapel Choir objects to uninformed review,"To the Editor: As members o f the Rooke Chapel Choir, we would like to make a few comments regarding the November 2,1990 review of our performance of Acis and Galatea. A  few incon sistencies (which we would like to correct) were presented. In the future, we would appreciate concert reviewers who are capable of arriving at the performance on time. Had Ms. Myrom arrived even seconds before the beginning of the performance, she would have known that the credited bass soloist, John Ostendorf, was unable to perform, and that Nathaniel Watson sang the part of Polyphemus instead. Also, while credits and praise are certainly due Handel for his mag nificent work, we hope this was not the only reason our audi ence responded "" positively."" Choir robes were not appropriate for the performance due to its secular nature. Therefore, we were obliged to borrow dresses from the Concert Chorale. Although a tail ored fit could not be achieved in every case, the dresses were quite comfortable. As for ""costuming"" in general, it is difficult to coordinate forty singers (not forty-nine) at Bucknell with an orchestra from New York and four solo ists who have private wardrobes. W e think Ms. Bairfl would have been a bit perturbed if it had been suggested that she wear a Chorale dress. We resent the mention of dress in the first place, since we feel our weeks of hard work deserve something more than a fashion report In response to Ms. Myrom's comment about the lack of scenery, props or action: Handel composed Acis and Galatea as a chamber opera, as it was presented last month. He asks us to use our imagination as we focus on the music; it could hardly have been expected that Gray- son Hirst be dragged off the stage after Acis' death. Handel had developed distinct styles each for his vocal writing and his instrumental writing so that such a superficial comparison between Acis and Galatea and Water Music is inaccurate. At any rate, a composer such as Handel surely deserves to be described as something more dignified than a ""sure-fire crowd-pleaser."" While we appreciate the efforts of Ms. Myrom, a reporter with a broader musical background could present a more educated and substantive review to the readers of The Bucknellian. Thank you for your consideration. Sincerely, Rooke Chapel Choir and D r. William Payn November 14,1990 to report for induction under this title, shall, upon the appropriate facts being presented to the local board, have his induction postponed (A) until the end of the semester or term, or academic year in the case of his last academic year, or (B) until he ceases satisfactorily to pur sue such course of instruction, whichever is the earlier."" This means that if a war against Iraq required a draft that col lege age men would only be allowed to finish their current semester (sen iors, their year) before going into service. Do you know how many United States' troops are in the Per sian Gulf now? Do you know when we may go to war? Do you know if you may get drafted next semester? I think that these questions are important for every man who may potentially lose his life and every woman who may lose her friends and family because of the action taken taken by the United States. Find out the answers to your ques tions and do something before more people, maybe you, die. S.T.O.P. strongly opposes the United States' military role and is organizing support for pulling United States' troops out of the Per sian Gulf. We believe that although the crisis in the Persian Gulf is seri ous and docs present legitimate problems for our country, these problems do not justify or merit the loss of lives or any form of war. We challenge every individual on this campus to educate his or herself about the conflict, our country's role, and possible alternatives to military action. We believe that alternatives do exist to military involvement. The United States has pursued only three months of diplo macy before resorting to military action. I believe the United States has absolutely no legitimacy in taking the role it has assumed in the Per- See S.T .O .P ., page 11"

BIO should accept the,
realities of budgeting,"By M ark Leister Last week's article in The Bucknellian explaining Bucknell International Organization (BIO)'s attempt to secure its proposed bud get for this year, spurred me to examine this issue more deeply. I could hardly believe that this organization was claiming (1) to be the only social activity on campus that its members enjoy, and (2) that the BSG had left them so finan cially deprived that they would probably be forced to disband. Assessing the situation in the very best possible light for BIO, one can agree with their sentiments that only receiving about 35% of your proposal can be disheartening. Most organizations would require widespread monetary changes to function on a budget slashed to that degree. However, upon further perusal, many amusing problems with both BIO and its budget begin to surface. First, how many people does the organization really have? The estimated 250 sounds highly inflated. I've heard estimates that put BIO's Activities Fair sign-up list at approximately that number, but most people on this campus know that this number does not rep resent actual weekly tum-out. Logi cally, the Appropriations Commit tee, having seen little evidence of such a drastic increase (70 to 250) in membership, placed the burden of proof upon B IO  and was swayed by their lack thereof. Second, BIO claims that its members are students who arc not involved with any other organiza tions. Therefore, BIO's members are not reaping the benefits of their $100 activities fee, because they arc getting such a small percentage. The natural question arises: whose fault is that? It is hardly the fault of the BSG. This campus can not expect BSG to make sure each and every student receives $100 worth of benefits from Bucknell's many organizations. Rather, it is the individual who must take charge by being active and making sure that advan tage is taken of as many facets of Bucknell as is possible. But I am also a bit befuddled as to why many of BIO's members are not involved with other organi zations. There should be an expla nation as to why these very diverse BIO students, who arc here to enrich both themselves and (we hope) the community, are segregat ing themselves into their own little club. There is something very wrong with that situation. Finally, there is the actual budget request which must be examined. Apparently, the vast majority (a rumored 90%) of B IO 's proposed budget was for food. There is a degree of audacity required in requesting that the BSG allocate funds for meals, when your organization will not even charge membership dues. Other organizations are fac ing cuts of truly necessary items in their budgets, and BIO has the brass to argue over food. If BIO indeed has 250 members, dues of $4 each would generate an extra $1000-- half of the actual budget-- and would take some of the burden off of the BSG. In conclusion, I am hopeful that groups like BIO will begin to look at the appropriations process in a more realistic light. BSG will do the best it can with its limited funds, and until it is blessed with bottomless coffers, student organi zations will have to act responsibly with their monies and cooperate within the system."
Freshman Forum,"By Jim  Joseph Well, the day has finally come. The news was spread throughout campus on fancy green and gold cards, buttons, and posters. I still remember the day when I found that little card on my doorknob. What a surprise to realize that the Gulf crisis wouldn't delay the opening of the new Bison any longer than today. You sec, for freshmen the new Bison presents an interesting change. All we have heard are the leg ends about the old Bison and felt the sense of loss by not having a Bison during our first year. O f course, we do have the substitute on the second floor of the U C , but the carefully decorated brown-carpeted walls probably won't match the new Bison. Stories of great pool games, video games and even good food right here on the Bucknell University campus conjure an unrealistic, even mythical image of the Bison for the freshmen. This is going to be an important new aspect of our Bucknell experience: a place to eat a good cheeseburger, a place to relax, a place to procrastinate. But beyond the simple activities found at the Bison, this will be a new place for comedians or bands. The Bison will offer alternatives to Bostwick meals, studying and boring dormitories. This will be an entirely new side of Bucknell never experienced by first year students. So, if you're reading this article after 9 p.m. on Friday, November 16, put it down and get over to the Bison and enjoy the music of "" Y  N O T ' and the comedy of Vic Henley. See you at the Bison! In a closing note, I would like to say to everybody who read my article two weeks ago or the response to it by the B A C  last week that the BAC made a very valid point. We do not have the right to complain about this if we are not making any effort to change the problem. So I invite all of you, as did the B A C  in (heir response article, to attend their meeting this Thursday, November 15 at 6 p.m. in room 219 of the U C."
S.T.O.P,"From page 10 sian Gulf crisis. I believe what our country has done is wrong and offensive and I will struggle to stop the United States' military actions. We should all educate ourselves and those of us against the war should explore and use as many means as possible to prevent its occurrence. The crisis in the Gulf requires long-term vision and non- military action-- such as maintain ing sanctions, diplomacy, de militarizing the conflict, and sup porting United Nations settling the historical and on-going disputes between the Persian Gulf countries. These alternatives and others shall be explored throughout the weeks to follow through articles, discus sions, and teach-ins. Whether you agree with our beliefs or not, edu cate yourself on this crisis and its many potential outcomes. It is your responsibility, not someone else's. If we continue to let this cri sis go by unnoticed, we may expe rience the pain of bonding our gen eration through the death of our friends and family.

Community addresses demonstration,
Bucknell students chose wrong forum,"It's easy to understand col- * lege students' frustration with rules that limit their freedom, because for many that freedom is new-found. And lots of students -- translate those new rights into the freedom to drink. Bucknell University in Lewisburg is among the hundreds of col leges across the country that have tightened the rules on drinking as states have moved to raise the drinking age to 21. This puts liquor out of legal range for most college students. It also means that while colleges may not be aggressive in keep ing liquor out of dormitories, they can no longer allow it to be served at on-campus parties. This has effectively forced lots of socializing off campus. The noise from one Halloween party Wednesday night drew complaints to the police, and their arrival became the catalyst for a dis turbance in which as many as 1,000 students participated. The only explanation offered by students was that they were upset with the school's alcohol policy. Unfortunately, they chose the wrong way to show their frustra"

Voice,"tion. Even though no one was hurt, the students have a lot to answer for: Why should students have the right to drink, even though state law prohibits the consumption of alcohol by people younger than 21? Why should the school break the law by allowing the uncontrolled serving o f liquor to minors on campus? Why does it make sense for students to disturb a neighborhood's peace by giving vent to their frustration at the school? Some students will probably try to cloak the incident on Seventh Street in a noble mantle by calling it a protest against the restriction of their rights. But they have no right to drink on campus or elsewhere, and their display took a form that doesn't even come close to making a point in their favor with the school or the community. For all of the real and understandable feelings behind it, Wednes day night's incident wasn't really a protest--it was a tantrum.

Turn a problem into opportunity,"By G ary Sojka Any discussion of what hap pened between Bucknell students and Lewisburg citizens and police on Halloween must begin with an apology to the community. It is most unfortunate that Lewisburg citizens had to endure disruption of their lives because of a growing problem between university students and the university administration. Please know that Bucknell is taking steps to encourage our students to reestab lish their social lives on campus, rather than in the community. We also hope that townspeople will have faith in our efforts to avoid not only the events of the kind we experienced on Halloween but also other inappropriate student activities, which continue to cause prob lems for the citizens of Lewisburg. We at the university are grateful for the forbearance and understanding of the members of our community as we take steps to deal with student social life. We also owe a debt to local law enforcement officials for their restraint in allowing us to resolve the situation peacefully. Pennsylvania has a longstanding law prohibiting drinking under age 21, but in recent years, that law has been redefined in ways that require strident enforcement. The problem centers on Act 31, enacted by well-intentioned legislators who were trying to deter what they consid ered to be growing problem of alcohol abuse in the under-21 age group. The unfortunate outcome of this law is that it has turned university administrators into monitors and disciplinarians rather than guides and mentors. In our efforts to comply with the law, we have created a situation that has encouraged our students to move more and more of their alco hol-related social life off campus and into the community. The results have been negative for this special town where we make our home, and the situation on campus also is worrisome. We know, for example, that students arc drinking behind closed doors, often to excess, with no one to say, "" Haven't you had enough?"" Our research tells us that most students begin drinking as early as high school, if not earlier, and they come to college expecting to escalate"
The President's Voice,"that pattern as part of their "" adult"" college experience. We tell new freshmen we'll call them men and women, not boys and girls. They _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ are 18, we remind them, and soon enough they understand that being men and women means they can vote, hold jobs, pay taxes, and be pros ecuted and sentenced as adults. They can, in fact, do everything an adult can do but drink. Prohibition should have taught us that people who want alcohol will go to any lengths to have it. By denying alcohol to students, who think of themselves as adults even though the law does not hold with that definition, we may be allowing alcohol to assume even greater importance in their lives. However, we are swom to uphold the law, and we will do so, as will continue to provide social alternatives for students to celebrate without alcohol. We also must work with our students, listening to their concerns, helping them understand that life is not always fair. They can be consid ered adults in every sense but one, but that doesn't absolve them of their responsibility to their neighbors and the community at large. As educa tors, we will continue to work toward a better solution. We welcome input from townspeople who have had success teaching their own off spring that there can be a rich social life without alcohol. We recognize Bucknell's responsibility for the Halloween distur bance, but we would like to turn it from a problem into an opportunity. Education is the ultimate solution. We need to continue to educate stu dents about the dangers of alcohol abuse, so that if they choose to drink, they will do so responsibly, fully aware of the harm it can do to their lives and their careers. And we need to study ourselves as a society to learn why alcohol-- and other substances--enjoy the prominence they do and what we can do to create more balance and appreciation for other forms of celebration.

Students look for attitude change,"By M ark Leister With the recent confronta tion between police and Bucknell students in the streets of Lewis burg, many people unfamiliar with the Bucknell situation are left to glean the facts from secondhand sources. As a Bucknell student, my opinion attempts to summarize the students' concerns and shed light on why there is such tension. The student perceptions of the problem with Bucknell's social system stem from incidents which occurred two years ago at the incep tion of Act 31, Pennsylvania's strictest underage drinking law. Just prior to the semester recess, the university sent out an announcement explaining the new law and soliciting student opinions. Unfortunately, the students had no time to voice their concerns because final exams were underway and free time to address such an issue was scarce. Upon returning at the beginning of the next semester, the students found their only exposure to Act 31 to be the university's enforcement of the new law. Furthermore, the university appeared to be basing its rather rigorous enforcement upon an unusually stringent interpretation of the new law. In the administration's attempt to minimize underage drinking- related liability, it implemented enforcement procedures designed to make Bucknell as inhospitable for underage alcohol consumption as possible. For example, the university created the concept of ""reasona ble cause,"" which allowed its security staff to enter private residence rooms at even the vaguest hint that a party was in progress. The students felt actions such as these were unusually oppressive and in violation of student rights. However, they slowly came to terms with these "" invasions o f privacy"" and began to cope with Bucknell's diminished social scene. Unfortunately, student tolerance was sorely tested when gross inconsistencies in alcohol enforcement were perceived. Students found that on important occasions such as Parents Weekend and Homecom ing, the university's enforcement o f its alcohol policies was virtually nonexistent. On these important weekends, when partying ran rampant and unchecked, the university appeared to be creating an illusion that Bucknell's social scene was not at all oppressed. The students were very aware of this fact and soon realized that there was an injustice in being trusted only part of the time and at the"
A Student's Voice,"university's discretion. Students believed that they could handle adult responsibilities, but that they were being labeled irresponsible and untrustworthy by the administration. This debate over trust between students and the administration esca lated, leading to greater animosity and tensions. These feeling finally sur faced on Lewisburg's Seventh Street on Halloween when students, who had been told to end an off-campus party, realized they had no place else to go. After having been forced from Bucknell's campus by what was seen as the oppressive force of the university, the students decided that they'd had enough. In what can best be labeled an act of emotion, the students protested their feeling o f having no place to socialize or escape Act 31 and Buckncll's untrusting and oppressive grip. Less that a week after Homecoming Weekend, the latest occasion of inconsistent enforcement, the university's administration was forced to tackle student concerns head-on. And it did. The administration finally made an impression on the students, planting a seed of hope that perhaps would grow into under standing between the two groups. Their mere presence into the early morning hours demonstrated a willingness to listen; Vince DcCcrchio Buckncll's new director of security and safety, who is replacing the man seen by many students as one cause of the oppression, showed that he is willing to change old ways by working with students to make the univer sity more livable. Those responsible for the promises to the student body have already begun to follow words with actions. On Tuesday, key administra tors held an open forum to address problems and begin discussions in a more formal setting, and many students looked upon these steps favora bly-- but cautiously. The administration was successful in portraying Bucknell as a changing setting where everyone can work together--and the students seem willing to try. The administration will have to follow through with its promises, however, because there is still a vein of distrust and skepti cism within the student body concerning this issue.

Lecture series examines,
political economy of media,"By Rob Schroeder Staff Writer A three-part lecture series designed to ""talk about how it is that the media is controlled by major corporations"" recently con cluded here. Through the sponsor departments of Economics, Politi cal Science, and Sociology, the function brought significant alter native voices to Bucknell; ones concerned with the influence of Public broadcasting, the greedy habits of corporations that control the media, and terrorism as it is portrayed and even perpetuated by the world of information. The series ran from mid-October to early November. The first lecture of the three, entitled ""Public Broadcasting: An Alternative to Corporate Control?"" was conducted by Steve Bass, the Director of National Corporate Support for the Public Broadcasting System. According to Economics Professor Dean Baker, the principle organizer of the series, Bass's dis cussion intended to explain ""what it was like to deal with the major media corporations."" PBS's diverse funding was discussed in detail, laying on the line the idea that the network is largely independent of business manipulation.. Bass, a Bucknell alumni, also talked about the motivations of cor porate giving, and what programs the business giants will and will not fund. Even though a major theme of the talk was PBS's freedom and large degree of self-sufficiency, Bass spoke with respect about the power of corporations to influence even those networks that are by and large public. Corporate sponsors are not willing to fund programs deal ing with controversial issues. Because of the large degree of money that comes from business sponsors, he explained, PBS is not actually as independent as its mem bership might prefer to have it. Bass was optimistic about this fact, though, and stressed that the Public eye, and scrutinize ""what it meant to have corporations...control so much of what we saw and heard..."" Schiller's energies were directed towards exposing the media for what it is in his view: non-diverse and almost unilaterally controlled by business interests. The alleged free press was a major target of his impassioned speech. ""All of this, what appears to be diversity,"" he said, ""is underwritten with one common denominator...the financ-"

The Collegiate,
Perspective...,
(and other fairy tales),"By Peter Lalos Staff Writer This week, ""The Collegiate Perspective"" will conduct a criti cal study of the domino-like col lapses of the communist nation states of eastern Europe, the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other sec ond-world nations across the globe. Such discourse, it is hoped, will raise the following questions: First, how did the dia lectical conflict between Marx ism in theory and Marxism in practice serve to tear the social, political, and economic frame works of these socialist regimes asunder? Secondly, what part did the international community's rapid technological advancement in the fields of communications and transportation play in the dcl- egitimation of the theories of his torical determinism and dialecti cal materialism followed by these countries? And finally, why does every pair of sweatpants that you buy from the bookstore always give you an inevitable wedgie? Furthermore: * Why are certain foods listed on the the cafeteria's menu boards sometimes placed in quo tation marks? It's a familiar situa tion-- you look up at the list over the serving line, and there it is: ""Quiche."" Is this supposed to mean that it's not quite that type of food, but close enough to war rant its being served? Time to get suspicious. * What Were They Think ing When They Did That, Part II: Did they actually believe that the colors orange, brown, and green would look good in just about every residence hall on campus? Who was the interior decorator in charge here? The Toxic Avenger? Swamp Thing? * Heck, let's do that riot thing on Halloween every year. We'll call it ..... mmm ..... Mardi Gras. * Why were our instructors called ""teachers"" while we were still in grade school, but are called ""professors"" now?

Now that I've been in college for a while.... I still haven't heard of any of them. Somehow, campus security is responsible for this. * That New York Times in the caf coatroom? Still there. * Forget the new Bison. Forget the Greek system. Forget the administration. We need to iirtport more squirrels, and fasti * The definition of a Buck nell student's nirvana?

Schiller adeptly gave exam ples of his ideas, exposing the audi ence to facts and figures like this one: about 70% of newspapers are financed by sponsors. The ""crucial message,"" he said, ""is the advertis ing message."" We consumers are exhorted to selectively spend our money via the media's promotion of goods. ""Life,"" in Schiller's view, is ""one big consumption festival."" Due to the tremendous influence of big business in the media (which includes the entertainment indus try), the public is only permitted to view a select, pre-determined array of information and entertainment, all the while being asked to buy the products of those that make the decisions of what is shown. According to Schiller, this is hardly in keeping with the freedom of speech that the United States so proudly proclaims. Those who can express themselves, he summar ized, are those with the money. The final lecture of the series was entitled 'The Media and the Terrorism Industry,"" which explored the portrayal of terrorism in the mass media, and how a sup posedly free and independent press seems to follow a government line. The lecture was given by Edward Herman, a Professor of Finance at the Wharton School of Business. Who is a terrorist and who is not, he stressed, is not an objective issue. ""No one who is our [the United States'] friend is a terrorist,"" he stated. He cited Syria as an example of the press's and the gov ernment's subjective labeling of terrorism. After an incident in which Syria helped to free U.S. hostages, the United States was willing to overlook Syria's former violations of human rights and international law. It is the ""ultimate double standard"" of the United States that we allow such favors to exist, Herman said. The administration and the press are willing to ignore those issues that are beneficial to the image of the United States, but quickly label similar issues not ben eficial as terrorist. ""No matter what [a country] [does] in the way of killing, murdering, or terrorizing"" is almost insignificant as long as that country is friendly to the United States. Subjective labeling of what terrorist activity is does not coincide with the allegedly impar tial press of this country, stressed Herman'. Herman's talk, like Schiller's and Bass's, painted an alarming picture about the state of the media today. The Political Economy of the Media lecture series, though disturbing and shocking at times, nonetheless provided a starting point for serious thought about what the public sees and hears day in and day out."
Dear Wanda,"Dear Wanda, I have a friend from high school with whom I just don't feel comfortable anymore. Every time I'm home, she calls and asks why I don't write or call her any more. I know the same thing will happen over Thanksgiving break, what can I do? Cornered Dear Cornered, This is a common problem. You seem to have changed while your friend expects you to be the way you were in high school. If she was not a good friend,, you can tell her you have been very busy with school work. This is probably true anyway. If you were close to her in high school, she deserves more respect than a quick brush-off. The best solution in this case is to be honest. Perhaps you can say that you feel you've changed and you don't feel as close to her anymore. You should let her know that you don't want to sever the ties com pletely, though. Emphasize the fact that you don't feel comfortable being as close as you used to be. Be careful of her feelings; try to ima gine how you would feel in her place. Dear Wanda, I had a lousy room pick last year and I've been living in a double on a hall I don't like. My roommate is fairly nice but I know now that we will not be real friends. What can I do? Claustrophobic Dear Claustrophobic, Don't give up on your roo- mate entirely! Life will be much more pleasant if you are friends. But if she doesn't seem interested, you could just avoid your room and the hall as much as possible. This is surprisingly easy to accomplish. Visit friends from last year - they will probably be happy to have you hang out in their rooms to talk or study. There are tons of clubs and campus organizations that you can join to keep busy. If you get clausr trophobic in the room, the library is a convenient place to work, read, or write letters. Walk into town with friends or by yourself - you can shop or get ice cream or sit in a park for a while. If you find your self ""trapped"" on the hall at night, call friends, do your laundry, or schlep down to the dorm TV room (take a book in case a bunch of peo ple are watching HeeHaw). Make sure you don't give up on your hall without trying to get to know your hallmates. They might become your best friends.

Maniacs cry peace,"By Jillian Myrom Staff Writer Before Natalie Merchant and the 10,000 Maniacs opened their act at Susquehanna Univer sity last Friday night, Mary Ram sey and her band prepared the audience with folk songs accom panied by violin. Ramsey's voice has a sound much like Mer chant's, and so it was not surpris ing to learn that Merchant and Ramsey have been recording together on a number of the 10.000 Maniacs well-known hits. After ""Ramsey and Lom bardo"", the opening act, finished their set, and after a brief inter mission, the 10,000 Maniacs began their act not with a song but a film. Their documentary- style reel of images portrayed Jamestown, New York (Mer chant's home town) around 1950, and was accompanied by a jazz selection unlike anything the 10.000 Maniacs would be likely to play. After the wordless film, the group began their show with a song off of their latest album. Merchant and her band played many of the public's favorites from their best known album, In My Tribe. Unfortu nately, the performance of sev eral of these songs was delivered with an inordinate amount of feed-back. Perhaps the size of the auditorium contributed to the feed-back. The auditorium was smaller than Davis Gym which is where the 10,000 Maniacs played three years ago. At that concert, for those who remember, Tracy Chapman, a then virtually unknown performer, opened for the Maniacs and received an indifferent, verging on rude, reception. The themes of the eve ning were Thanksgiving and peace. Merchant requested that the audience sing a Thanksgiving song for her, which didn't work too well; nevertheless she later requested that we sing ""Peace Train"" for the band. The peace theme became explicit when Merchant held a dyed flag embla zoned with the peace symbol in front of her, covering herself from the audience's view, as she sang the last song. The crowd seemed overly receptive to the various appeals for peace throughout the evening. ""Gun Shy,"" the In My Tribe song about a woman's resistance to her brother's joining the army was also well received by the audience. The message is timely, in that the U.S. is on the brink of war in the Middle East and Americans have been slow in ral lying for peace. Nevertheless, the tie-dyed apparel and the fingers making peace symbols waved in the air at Susquehanna seemed to reflect a sort of hollow symbol ism and rhetoric. The band did, of course, return for an encore, finishing up with ""City of Angels"", ""Happy Puppet"", and finally ""Verdi Cries."" Many voices in my sec tion could be heard shouting out requests for ""Verdi Cries"", which turned out to be the final selec tion of the evening. The rendition of the song was performed by Merchant at the piano and Ram sey on the violin, which pulled together the range of music and styles heard from both performers. An unfortunate aspect of the evening was the lack of pub licity for the opening band. The opening act was listed no where in print; neither on the ticket stubs nor on the announcement board in Weber Chapel Auditor ium, where the concert was held. Apparently Ramsey's band was a surprise to the Susquehanna box office manager as well, for the office was unable to provide a name of the band even after the show.

America's storyteller performs,"By Lydia Neuman Tonight renowned singer Judy Collins will appear at the Weis Center as part of the Weis Center's Special Effects Series. Since the outset of her career in the early sixties, Collins has recorded such hits as ""Send in the Clowns"" and ""Both Sides Now"" as part of a broad repertoire that encompasses songs from musicals and has cul minated in six gold records. Collins has been labeled as America's storyteller and in addi tion to performing with the Boston Pops, the National Symphony and the Chicago, Atlanta, San Fran cisco and Detroit symphony orchestras, she has toured exten sively throughout Europe. In 1968, Collins was the guest artist at the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, Royal Festival Hall in London. Collin's credits extend to the realm of theater as well. She starred in the New York Shake speare production of ""Peer Gynt"" and has appeared frequently on such shows as ""The Tonight Show,"" ""Saturday Night Live,"" ""David Letterman,"" ""Sesame Street"" and ""The Today Show."" Crusades for World Peace, AIDS Research and World Hunger among others, are movements to which Collins has committed her time and energies. Collins's new album, Fires of Eden has just been released on Columbia records. This is her first album with Columbia and her enthusiasm for this new release is tremendous. She is not only excited about the songs, but also about the causes which the album is working for. The songs speak about peace and the plight of the homeless and the value of the earth's precious resources. The letter on the inside of the CD cover points out the messages of some of the songs and talks about the importance of being con scious about our environment Trees must be planted to replace those which have been lost and paper must be recycled. Collins asks her listeners to take their first steps in recycling by throwing away the box that the CD comes in. Also, Collins talks about a fund which she has begun which will take proceeds from each sold copy of Fires of Eden and work to plant saplings in Colorado to make the air that we breathe just a little bit ""sweeter."" Tonight's performance should feature songs from Collins's past albums and songs from Fires of Eden, such as ""The Blizzard"" and ""The Air That I Breathe."" Courtesy of Columbia Records Judy Collins will be performing tonight in the Weis Center at 8 p.m. Collins has been noted as ""America's storyteller."""
Exits and Entrances,
features fifty,"|i  >> -- - - Courtesy of Public Relations ""Paris Oval,"" by Lee Male is just one of the 115 photographs in the Center Gallery's new exhibit, Exits and Entrances By Cynthia Levinson Staff Writer The Center Gallery has opened its second exhibit of the year this week. Unlike the last exhibit, this display features not five artists, but fifty, and not paint ings, but photographs. The exhibit is titled Exits and Entrances and provides the viewer with 115 pho tographs, some black and white, some color, and some handpainted works, of various exits and entrances. The title of the exhibit lim ited the artists to showing only images of exits and entrances, but the title also left quite a bit of room for personal interpretation. And interpret they did. Artists took the concepts of exit and enter to the extremes. Some artists showed simple images of doors and win dows while other artists provided photographs in which they took a less literal interpretation of exit and enter. Gallery director, Robert Metzger, commented that ""the pho tographs, in a variety of sizes and approaches, range from public spaces in large cities to everyday genre scenes in the United States and abroad. There are also views of intimate surroundings and dra matic portrayals of urban life. Together, the photographs in this exhibition present a unique visual perspective to humanity's relation ship with its built environment."" Artists featured in the exhibit range from seasoned masters such as Brassi, Felix Bonfils, Manuel Alareez Bravo, and Jusef Sudek to Isle Bing, Elliot Erwitt, Ralph Gib son, Lee Male, Helmut Newton, Gerard Rinaldi, Neal Slavin, Stella Snead, Ned Snyder, and Garry Winogrand. There are also a num ber of exciting young talents such as Karen Bussolini, James Craw ford, George Dudley, George Kon- taxis. Wit McKay and Mark Nickerson. In addition to the above men tioned featured artists, the exhibit hosts a number of works by local talents as well. The Exits and Entrances exhibit will feature the works of Debra Cook, Frank Hagenbuch, David Lauver, Flor ence Putterman, and Terry Wild. All of the artists have pro vided the viewer with highly per sonal and moving images of their time and place. They provide the viewer with beautiful and thought provoking images from their per sonal experiences. The exhibit was open for viewing as of this past Monday, and the opening reception will be held tomorrow evening from 7-9 p.m. in the Center Gallery. The reception is open to the public and should provide the viewers with a chance to meet a number of the local artists and talk with them about their works."

Rhythm of Brazil hits U.S.,"Copyright Paul Simon 1990 By Jon Elliot Staff Writer Paul Simon is known to many as part of the cross- generational folk group, Simon and Garfunkel. To others, he is the man who brought the sounds of South Africa to the American pop scene with his 1987 release of Graceland. But his most recent release, Rhythm of the Saints , is to the rhythms and sounds of Brazil as Graceland was to the harmonizing sounds of South Africa. It is rare that we see such an individual stay on the music scene for nearly thirty years, and be able to continue to produce albums of such high quality and diversity. The cultural exploration opens with a rhythmic intro into ""The Obvious Child,"" which is a retrospective look at a life which has become complacent and ordi nary. Sunny, Simon's character, struggles with his current situation, exclaiming ""...Some have fled from themselvcs/Or struggled from here to get thcre/Sonny wanders beyond his interior walls/Runs his hand through his thinning brown hair."" More interesting than the lyr ics in 'The Obvious Child"" (usu ally the strength of Simon pieces) is the outstanding percussion which sets the stage for an adventure into the rhythms of the ritualistic sounds of the African based cultures of Brazil. Notwithstanding, we've dis covered a recording which, as Graceland did, should set a prece dent for the trends in the American popular music scene. Paul Simon uses the sounds and instruments of the Brazilian culture, which add a dimension to his new sound that is rarely heard on today's pop music scene. From the rhythmic sounds on the opening track, Simon grace fully eases his direction toward that of what sounds like a xylophone, but what must be, in reality, a per cussion piece from Brazil. ""Can't Run But"" is erie in its mix of instruments and vocals, with the vocals being hypnotically drowned out by the saintly rhythms. Although the musical energy suggests life and mystique, Simon's always powerful lyrics suggest destruction and turmoil. The problems facing the rain forests of South America have recently become a vital concern for environmentalists, politicians and musicians alike, and Simon seems desperately concerned for the peo ple of the regions native to the forests decline. The South African style of Graceland reappears on 'The Coast"" with Simon's decision to once again call for the talents of the township sounds of Ladysmith Black Mombazo as backing vocals. The Brazilian rhythmic sounds again flourish in ""Further to Fly."" A song about a love sadly lost and the memory of it's pain. ""The Cool, Cool River"" is where it seems that Simon pulls Rhythm of the Saints together with a lyrical talent possessed by few musical poets. As we have seen, Simon speaks of a corrupted envi ronment, a life gone stagnant and loves lost and still the glow of the Brazilian sun seems to continue to shine on the free-flowing rhythm. It is in ""The Cool, Cool River"" where Simon lets the lyrics and the rhythm flow together, optimisti cally harmonizing, ""...I believe in the futurc/We shall suffer no more/ Mabye not in my lifetimc/But in yours I feel sure."" but then he sadly sees ""My life...disappear/And sometimes even music/cannot sub stitute the tears."" The Saints are producing a rhythm duplicated only in the hills of the African-Brazilian cultures of South America. Paul Simon seems to have the uncanny ability to com bine the tribal sounds of the bush with his poetic genius in order to produce an album of such magni tude. That is not to say that Rhythm of the Saints will necessarily crack the top ten on the charts, but as Graceland did several years ago, it just may pave the way for future trends in the popular music for the 1990s."
The butler provides humor,"Photo by Debra Cook What the Butler Saw will be performed November 16-19 in the Tustin Studio Theatre. The play will be directed by Karen McCann as part of her senior thesis. Pictured here are Professor Baumwoll, Meme Cul- lison '91, and Penelope Kokines '91. By Deborah Bloodgood The Department of 'Theatre and Dance will be performing What the Butler Saw by Joe Orton, from November 16-19 at 8 p.m. in Tustin Studio Theatre. The cast consists of Professor Dennis Baumwoll as Dr. Prentice, Penelope Kokines '91, as his nymphomaniac wife, Marc Kenny '91, as the government inspector, Meme Cullison '91, as the ingenue, George Hannah '93 as the lustful bellboy, and Tom Quinn '91, as the bumbling Sergeant Match. The play is directed by senior Karen McCann as part of her senior thesis. McCann describes the play as ""multifaceted. It explores the dramaturgy of farcical convention, while examining the oppressive nature of social institutions."" Orton combines dark humor and slapstick in the traditional drawing room set to create a thought provoking picture of the effects of society on its members. He uses the conventional motiva tions of farce--lust, greed, and ego centrism as well as other conven tions--transvestism, preset props, and the ""seduction-gone-wrong"" motif which leads to a snowballing of misunderstandings. McCann suggests that ""Always beneath the Wildean com edy of manners lies the Dionysian/ Apollonian conflict to fulfill vis ceral human needs, which dictates the action."" The result is pure lunacy. Orton wrote in England dur ing the 1960's. Within several years of writing his first play, he had gained fame throughout Eng land with two full length plays, one screen play and several one acts. In 1967 in the midst of his budding fame, he was brutally in his sleep at the age of 29 by a jealous lover. What the Butler Saw was found completed in his room dur ing the murder investigation. It was produced posthumously in 1969. McCann relates that ""Orton's life style was one of flamboyant homo sexuality, a subject dealt with in his plays over and over again."
Anais Nin's diaries,
expose Miller's life story,"By Michael McGandy Staff Writer In his cinematic rendering of Anais Nin's diaries from the year of 1931, director Philip Kaufman has compellingly pre sented the passionate dynamic between art and life--a dynamic so forceful that the characters attempt to consume one another sexually and by means of the writ ten word. ""Henry and June,"" which showed at the Campus Theater this week, reverberated with the erotic and intellectual intensity of Paris's bohemian quarter which was the home of Anais's expatriate lovers Henry and June Miller. The very apprearcnce of a film such as ""Henry and June,"" which was highly erotic and dealt explicitly with lesbian relation ships, was an event in itself and a welcome departure from the more common fare found at the Cam pus Theater. Kaufman, who has also directed an adaptation Milan Kun- dcra's ""The Unbearable Lightness of Being,"" based his work on Anais Nin's diaries from those early years when she met the as yet unknown author Henry Miller living in Parisian squalor and writing his infamous book The Tropic of Cancer. Anais, a dedi cated diarist and novelist through out her life, chronicled her years of initial intellectual engagement with Miller through their sexual passion and into their years of friendship and literary partrtership. The segment of Anais's diaries that she herself entitled ""Henry and June"" tell of her rela tions with Miller, but also of Anais's emotional attachment and sexual desire for Miller's pale wife with burning eyes, June. In Kaufman's rendering, June is pre sented as the sexual and literary object of both Miller and Anais. June, played by Uma Thomas, considers her portrayal in The Tropic of Cancer too base; when she recognizes herself in Anais's first draft of what would become House of Incest, she com plains that she is not real enough. As June would say, she wanted ""beauty"" and she wanted Miller to be a ""Dosteovesky"" as he cap tured her beauty. Nor did she find ^ in Anais's perception a correct or authentic vision of herself. Rather, all she found were writers, writers who use and consume their subjects. Indeed, writing as sexual possession and sexual possession as writing is the metaphor which unites the action of ""Henry and June."" Both Anais and Miller, played by Maria de Mcdcrios and Fred Ward, record their erotic experiences in writing and in some sense may be said to be seeking this erotica for the sake of their writing. As intellectuals--and par ticularly in Anais's case a bour geois intellectual--Anais and Miller arc consumers of the rough beauty of the Brooklyn actress that exists without words. This set of relations is com pleted by June's desire to have her living given literary expression. June becomes the continuing object of these writers intellectual and sexual energies, but the relation ships arc a bit one-sided. June, as she says, ""keeps giving and giving"" in order to fill Anais's and Miller's white pages. Yet, both tcxtually and through his cinematography, Kauf man critiques both the dynamic between heterosexuality and homo sexuality, as well as the very nature of bourgeois society. Anais and Miller may desire June as a sexual and literary object which they can use and recreate, but Anais relates to June far differently than Miller. There is an emotion which transcends Miller's childish desire for possession, a tenderness which makes the sexuality shared between Anais and June far more erotic than Miller's ""brutality."" It is particularly in these scenes when Anais and June are together that Kaufman's use of the camera is the most perceptive, most able to delve beneath appearences to their emo tional undercurrent. Anais ""understands June as a woman"" which is something Miller can not even begin to comprehend. For Anais, June remains objectified but in a more peculiar and loving way; their meetings are charged with the sense that a great deal is at stake--love. . At various moments in the film as Anais and June are standing with men, talking with men, their eyes continue find each other. Here Kaufman brilliantly has the men physically surrounding the women while the vision of these women. their thoughts and desires, cannot be so restrained. Indeed, Kauf man effectively conveys the cru cial nature of vision in this dynamic of perception that grasps word and flesh. But while Anais may be more compassionate to June, her stakes in this erotic and literary game are not as steep as Miller's. When June stands against him in his filthy apartment, Miller bursts into a juvenile outrage since out side of his writing and his subject in June he is completely impov erished. Anais, though an intel lectual like Miller, has not made an attempt to reject her bourgeois home and husband. When chaos racks her life on the dirty streets of the West Bank, her thoroughly bourgeois husband Hugo comes along in his shiny auto to take her away--her early manuscript of House of Incest under her arm. In ""Henry and June"" Kauf man recreates the intellectual fer ment and the moral chaos of Paris in the 1930s. By beginning the film with the opening strains of Stravinsky's Rite of Spring and using clips of Dada cinema tography such as Dali's Un Chien Andoulou, the climate of tension and gnawing social uncertainty is established. Indeed, Miller wages his battle against moral prohibition which so attracted Anais in the com pany of magicians, clowns, and contortionists; the neighborhood in which his apartment is located is camivalesque. Hugo, the voice of the bourgeoisie, says that he has always feared carnivals. This fearful and disturbing climate where all is allowed--nudity, sex, rape--and all moral codes are null, excites the bourgeoisie, but ultimately repulses causing them to return to their fine homes. The parasitic artist, though, follows their money and panders to their interests, using them just as he used the beauty of June. But ultimately Miller was not able to write Anais out of his life as he had June since his need for her capital was unquenchable; while in The Tropic of Cancer he was able to completely consume June, leav ing it to Anais to write her story as only a woman could. ______________ _ ___________ _"

The never-ending dehnte,
Should college football have a playoff?,
system should stay,
The bowl,"By Mark Griffith Staff Writer As the holiday season approaches, so do the plethora of college bowl games and the never-dying issue of whether or not the NCAA should initiate a playoff system to decide college football's national champion. As some might say, if col lege basketball has its NCAA Tournament, and college baseball has the College World Scries, why can't college football have a playoff system to decide its national champion? A careful analysis of the facts and nature of the present sit uation reveals why the NCAA has not and should not sway from the current system that has given college football the New Year's spotlight it deserves. The first argument that is. given in favor of a playoff is always that a non-subjective manner should be used to deter mine the national champion. I ask these proponents of a playoff system to tell me if they plan to do away with the ranking system. Surely the Associated Press's determination of the top twenty-five teams in the nation would have to stay in order for the mythical number one vs. number two match-up to occur. Now, I ask again, how objec tive is the ranking system? For instance, how qualified was the University of Virginia when the honor of number one was bestowed upon it? The question of subjectiv ity would not be eliminated with a playoff. The playoff proponents want a situation where the supposed top two teams play each other for the national title. For all you Penn State fans, you certainly remember when the second-ranked Nittany Lions defeated Vinny Testaveide and the top-ranked Hurricanes. Oh, by the way, this year's Orange Bowl is pitting Notre Dame against the Buffaloes of Colorado, the present number one and number two teams once again. What a coincidence. A playoff should include the top sixteen teams, advocates say. This would make sure the best team won. That would take every week of December so that the finals would still fall on New Year's Day. Do these football players also attend a college for academic rea sons or can they take sick leave for the traditional finals period? If the NCAA practices what they preach regarding aca demics, this period in December will be left for the classroom, not the gridiron. Begin the playoffs after the finals period, they might add. What? No determination of a national champion on New Years' Day? Where is their sense of tradition? We might as well hold the Super Bowl on a Tues day and eat chicken for Thanks giving if we are going to that extreme. Enough of why there should not be a playoff system. Now I will give a positive effect that the present bowl picture gives to the sport. When the last second of the last college bowl game has ticked off the clock, the season still lives in the minds of the fans. The fans have something to debate for the months to come. If college football comes to the cut and dried determination of a national champion as is seen by some in the playoff system, the game will lose the aspect of con troversy that makes the New Year's festivities a full day of excitement."
"""Sideline coach"" provides",
faculty unique opportunity,"By Jamie Diaferia Staff Writer At a glance of Bueknell, one tends to notice the strong academic atmosphere prevalent throughout the campus. No one doubts that the students and teachers treat educa tion with a great amount of serious ness and intensity. But a majority of the people that grace the halls of Coleman and Vaughan Lit. also give their best efforts on the ath letic fields as well. At Bueknell a ""student-athlete"" is not the oxy moron that it is at other campuses. In fact, our university has accumu lated the second-most Academic All-Americans in the nation, and students here take pride in this strong tradition. In an attempt to tran scend this com mitment to excel- - lence from the students to faculty members, the athletic department, led by Bueknell Director of Athlet ics Rick Hartzell, has instituted the ""Sideline Coach"" program. Cur rently, Bueknell is the only school in the country to employ such a program. The concept for ""Sideline Coach"" is rather simple. Sid Jamie son, coordinator of the program, began last year by searching the school for participants. His goal was to select faculty and adminis trators ""from each discipline of the school."" The focus of the program was to demonstrate to the faculty that athletics and academics should not be at odds with each other. Jamieson said, ""The program allows the faculty to get gut feel ings about the good relationship that exists between academics and athletics."" Upon being selected by Jamieson, two faculty members receive memos in the mail with the agenda for the week. Their job is to observe, but they are free to partici pate in any way they feel comforta ble. Along with the agenda, they will each receive a playbook with which to follow along. On Tues day, the participants attend the 8 p.m. film drill in Davis Gym, where the football staff will review films and plan their offensive and defensive strategies for Saturday. At this time the faculty members are split up so that one will work with the offensive coordinator while the other works with the de fensive coordinator. On Wednesday, the partici pants will attend the 4:45 p.m. practice to experience the rigors of the game, and observe the work which each member of the team puts into the sport. Before the prac tice, the coaches will review what was discussed Tuesday, and apply those lessons to the practice. As Jamieson stated, the emphasis of the learning experience is on the faculty member's realization of the preparation that is involved in each practice. As the participants leant, this organization is very similar to what a teacher must do each week in preparation few their classes. Finally, on Saturday the faculty members take the field with the Bison and stand on the side lines for the duration of the game. At halftime, they sit in on the team meeting and experience the inten sity of the game that one does not sense from the stands. In his memo, Jamieson warns the partici pants that they will be part of an extremely emotional experience, and that they may hear things that ""only occur in football locker rooms,"" but that they should be understanding. On the Tuesday after the game, the faculty mem bers are invited to the Lewisburg Touchdown Club luncheon where they have the opportunity to speak of their experience. The results of the program have been nothing short of extraor dinary since its inception last year. Before the program began, the rela tionship between faculty members and athletic coaches was somewhat strained. The apparent lack of communication and physical dis tance between academic and ath letic buildings had a great deal to do with this problem. Oftentimes, faculty members were, and, to some extent, still are, reluctant to accept excuses for missed classes if they involve athletics. With the ""Sideline Coach"" program, the gap has been bridged, and new lines of communication have been opened up for the benefit of faculty mem bers and students. Marketing professor Dan Gil bert told the Philadelphia Daily News, ""I know that the academic side has discovered how truly dedi cated the coaches are and how se riously they view academics. From the point of view of the athletic department--which has always stood off to itself--it helps the coaches build relationships [among the faculty] and opens lines of communication that can be bene ficial in terms of acceptance."" Hartzell agreed, stating, ""What people are discovering is that coaches are indeed teachers and that athletes are indeed students. When I started here two years ago, I remember people kept referring to the athletic department as 'they' or 'those peo ple across campus.' Our aim here is to change those words to 'us.'"" Another positive aspect of the program is that it proves Bueknell is steering clear of rules violations. In the age of recruiting scams and steroid abuse in college football, Bueknell has managed to come out untainted. Certain stereotypes pre vail throughout college football, and faculty and trustees are undoubtedly led astray by such accusations. Bueknell has ""no secrets"" according to Head Coach Lou Maranzana. The ""Sideline Coach"" program allows Bueknell to legitimately dispel any possible myths regarding rule infractions. The success of the ""Sideline Coach"" program at Bueknell has shown signs of a new trend in col lege football. Similar to the Soviet Union's policy of ""Glasnost,"" the Bison football team is setting an example by revealing itself to the community. The results have been unquestionably positive. Of the twenty-plus faculty members that have participated in the program, all have viewed it as a tremendous experience."

coaches are indeed teachers and that,

Rick Hartzell,
A national playoff is needed,"By Mark Abrahamsen Staff Writer Around this time every November, college football enthu siasts across the nation wonder what the game would be like if it had a national playoff to look for ward to. It's rather amazing in these days of television and money ruling big-time college ath letics, that the NCAA hasn't insti tuted a post-season plan that would be tailor-made for universi ties, TV, and college football fans. Every team sport that the NCAA recognizes on a Division I level already has established a post-season tournament to deter mine an outright national cham pion. Currently NCAA basket ball's ""March Madness"" is the most exciting sports spectacle in the United States. A playoff for Division I football would rival the current NCAA basketball tourna ment for the top single event in intercollegiate athletics, and every year there would be no debate as to who really is #1. Many traditionalists favor keeping the bowl structure as it is. They argue that a playoff season would run too long (conflicting with academic finals), the system would corrupt the game further with greedy and unethical coaches and athletic directors, and each of the individual bowls would lose their historical flavor. These argu ments are credible, but they fail to illustrate the bottom line of what the game is ultimately all about: determining which of two teams is better. For many universities which field perennial bowl teams, their football programs arc simply step ping stones for athletes to reach the National Football League. As for the thought of ""student- athletes"" having troubles mixing classes with the extended season, those who are truly concerned about academics should attend uni versities such as Bueknell or any other school that is primarily aca demically-oriented. And if an ath lete doesn't believe he can be noticed by professional scouts at a Division I-AA or smaller school, direct that person to Bison tackle and mechanical engineer Jay Butler '91, who is likely to be drafted somewhere in the middle rounds of the upcoming N.F.L. Draft. The greatest running back of all time, Walter Payton, never played in a major college bowl game. He spent his collegiate career at Division n Jackson State. The college game is already too corrupt with drugs, money, and illegal recruiting, so much so that adding a playoff isn't going to make the present ""win at all costs"" attitudes worse. As for the bowls' sense of nostalgia, my playoff plan would include keeping their titles and sites, and the potential match ups would be significantly more attractive for the fans. The following playoff sce nario would cure all heated debates in offices, bars, and locker rooms as to who is the best team in the land: 1) Keep the Associated Press (sportswriters) poll during the regu lar season, but eliminate from the rankings all teams that are on pro bation for the current year. Elimi nate all other polls for simplicity. 2) Award the top 16 teams from the final A.P. poll a bid for post-season play. 3) Form a single-elimination tournament upon the conclusion of the regular season, where #1 would face #16 in the first round, #2 vs. #15, #3 vs. #14, and so on. On the surface many of these first-round contests would appear to be mis-matches, but if the sea son ended today, top-ranked Notre Dame would play #16 Michigan. (Not a bad game for an opening-round contest.) 4) Eliminate the four small est current bowls (California, Independence, Freedom, and Copper). The remaining fifteen bowls would generate the 15 games required for the proposed playoff, and each game would be played with the bowl's current name and held at its present site. 5) Start the tournament the first Saturday after Thanksgiving. The tournament would take four weeks to play, and the champion ship would conclude before Christmas. This would allow both players and coaches a well- deserved rest for the holidays. 6) Rotate the National Championship each season between the traditional ""major bowls"" (Rose, Cotton, Orange, and Sugar), so that Pasadena, Dal las, Miami, and New Orleans would host the title once every four years. In the recent months, many universities (e.g. Penn State, Miami, Arkansas) have affiliated themselves as new members of established conferences. With the recent shuffling of schools, it appears that a playoff in college football is certain for the future, perhaps within five years. When the inevitable occurs, a tourna ment leading to the National Championship will be healthy for the game of collegiate football, and for its fans as well."
Volleyball ends season,
winless in Patriot League,"Sarah Mesaros '93 and Meg Kinney '92 ready themselves to return an opponent's serve in a match played earlier this season. The Lady Bison struggled this year, finishing 0-6 in the league and 3-22 overall. By Todd Bianchine Staff Writer The women's volleyball team concluded a disappointing season last weekend as it bowed out of the Patriot League tournament after los ing both of its matches. Bueknell fell to the eventual champion, Col gate, in the first match 15-10, 15-6, 15-7, and to the host team, Holy Cross, 15-1,15-11, 15-11. Bueknell finished the season with an overall record of 3-22, 0-6 in the confer ence. Lady Bison coach Cindy Opalski was out of town and una vailable for comment. After coming off a good prac tice session, Bueknell was fired up to play the Lady Red Raiders of Colgate in their first-round match. However, Colgate was ready for the challenge, as the took the Lady Bison in three straight games. Bucknell's middle blockers, Kris Colbert '91 and Kathleen Sullivan '92, the latter who led the Patriot League in blocking, proved their dominance at the net as they each chalked up five blocks in the match. Outside hitter Meg Kinney '92 led all Lady Bison with seven kills. ""We really played well against Colgate,"" said co-captain Kara Forosisky '92. ""I think we took them by surprise, because eve ryone was really up for the match."" Bueknell didn't fare as well against the Lady Crusaders in their second match, as they took a beat ing in the first game 15-1. But Bueknell rebounded in the second and third games, scoring 11 points in each. Colbert, in her last match as a Lady Bison, chalked up five more blocks for the tournament and put down nine kills. Sullivan came up with four blocks and assisted on three others. ""We really didn't play all that well (against Holy Cross), but Kris had a great tournament up front,"" said Forosisky. ""She is going to be greatly missed, especially up front as a middle blocker. It takes a lot of time and experience to play middle blocker and we're going to have a tough time replacing her."" Colgate wound up winning the tournament, beating previously unbeaten Army in the tournament Michael Klemen/The Bucknellian finals. Lehigh almost pulled off a big upset when it forced top-seeded Army to five games in the semifi nal game, and the Lady Engineers wound up taking fourth-place. As for Bueknell, it will look to next year when the team will have four seniors with considerable experience. ""This is not the season we See VOLLEYBALL, page 19"

Head Coach Lou Hen son returns only one starter and five lettermen from last year's 21-8 squad. Freshman Deon Thomas (6'8"") promises to be one of the nation's top rookies. 1990 NIT finalist, St. Louis, and the Comhuskers of Nebraska will square-off in game two. Bil- liken coach Rich Grawer lost a great deal of talent to graduation, but his team should provide a chal lenge for its Big Eight Conference opponent. The Northern Iowa Panthers and the Old Dominion Monarchs could be the most exciting first round match-up. The Panthers of Northern Iowa, who upset Missouri in the opening round of last year's NCAA tournament, return the majority of their lettermen, including three starters, as does ODU, where Buck nell Coach Charlie Woollum spent three years as an assistant coach. Buckneli faces Murray State at 9 p.m. Friday in the final game of the first round. The Racers fin ished 21-9 last season and are led by Ohio Valley Conference MVP Popeye Jones. The 6'8"" center (19.5 ppg, 11.2 rpg) almost upset Michigan State singlehandediy in the NCAA tournament's first round. Coach Newton returns five other lettermen who all saw signifi cant playing time last season. Point guard Frank Allen (14.6 ppg) and Paul King (10.8 ppg) join Jones as returning starters. The Bison will look to change defenses throughout the game to try to neutralize MSU's potent offense. Offensively, Buck nell will need the same balanced scoring that it enjoyed in its pre-season vic tory against the Verich Reps. 'This year's field is closely matched. The seeding committee felt that many of the teams are capable winning the champi onship but will begin their seasons with many ques tions to be answered in San Juan,"" said tourna ment director Lee Frederick.

Football,"From page 20 to kick an 18-yard field goal after being unsuccessful in three rushing attempts from the one-yard line. The key play of the drive was a 12 yard-completion from Hatajik to Lester Erb '91. Erb has caught 40 passes this year for 648 yards. The field goal, which made the score 7- 3, was Krutchkoffs seventh in a row, tying a Bucknell record that was set in 1982. Krutchkoff has not missed a field goal all season. Lehigh was not phased though, as it took the ensuing kick off and drove 59 yards in just six plays to increase its lead to 14-3 on a nine-yard run by Erick Torain. The key play in the drive was a 38- yard pass play, which set up the touchdown run. The Engineers had one more threat late in the half, as they drove 50 yards before Trevor Smith '91 came up with an interception with 25 seconds left in the half. Smith leads the team with five interceptions. In the first half, the Engineers outpassed the Bison 132 yards to 23. Hatajik only completed 3 of 11 passes. Both teams were ineffective on the ground, Lehigh gaining 38 yards while Bucknell only gained 30. The stingy Bucknell defense kept the Bison in the game.

Bucknell finally got the offense into gear, as it took the ball on its second possession of the half and moved 66 yards, using over five minutes of the clock. The key play was on a 33-yard completion from Hatajik to Erb. The drive con cluded with a three-yard run by Matt Walsh '93. Bucknell then tried for the two-point conversion attempting to bring the score within a field goal, but the pass fell incom plete, keeping the score at 14-9.

Fourth quarter flurry keys football win,"By Scott Brown Staff Writer Bucknell, which has been characterized as a first half football team, played strongly in the final quarter against Lehigh Saturday, including an 11-yard touchdown scramble by Todd Hatajik '91 with :48 left in the game. The score capped off a 21-0 run that turned a 27-9 deficit into a 30-27 win. The win halted a three-game losing streak and ensured the Bison their first winning season in ten years. If the Bison beat Fordham tomorrow it will give them their seventh win, a plateau which they have not reached since 1964. A key to the game was the inclement weather conditions, including a stiff wind that blew all day. Head Coach Lou Maranzana stressed the impact o f the weather, stating, "" It helped us against their offense. They have outstanding speed and rely on the long plays to get them touchdowns. One factor that is ironic is that with the condi tions the team that gets ahead usu ally stays ahead. The weather put a damper on their offense. Our style of offense is balanced enough to move the ball. We overcame the weather to a big extent."" The fourth quarter began with the Bison trailing by 18 points. They scored touchdowns on all three of their fourth quarter pos sessions, controlling the ball for over 12 of the 15 minutes. The first touchdown came following the kickoff after Lehigh's final score. Buckncll's offense, which began on its own 42-yard line, drove the length of the field, ending with a one-yard run by Brian Henesey '92. The key plays of the drive were a 25-yard pass from Hatajik to Jeff Pape '92, and a three-yard gain by Henesey on a fourth-and- one. Pape was later forced to leave j y M T f  g y ..

Cross-country,
seasons finish,
Women place third at EC AC's,"By Jennifer Walsh Staff Writer In their only post-season meets of the year, Bucknell's women's and men's cross-country teams provided followers with a surprise. Running in the E C A C  Cham pionships against Army, Manhat tan, Lehigh, Colgate, Lafayette, Delaware, Maine, and New Hamp shire, the Lady Bison finished third with 122 points. Just ahead of Bucknell was Army, which totaled 111 points, and first-place finisher Manhattan, which amassed 100 points. As they ran through both mud and pouring rain, the women not only managed to finish ahead of six other teams, but also kept the race close among Army, Manhattan and themselves. Even more impres sive was the fact that Bucknell defeated Lehigh and Lafayette, two teams that had beaten the Lady Bison just two weeks earlier at the Patriot League Championships. Captain Kelly Marsh '91 remarked, "" It was really exciting to be able to bounce back after confer ences and beat Lafayette and Lehigh. It was a nice ending to our season."" Cross-country coach Art Gul den was in agreement with the idea that the team's resilience proved to be a positive influence of the outcome. Gulden noted, "" It was real the game with a bruised shoulder. He is improving and will probably see some action in tomorrow's game. Bucknell's second touch down in the quarter was sparked by a Kevin Kane '93 fumble recovery on the Lehigh 30-yard line. Seven plays later, Henesey scored his sec ond touchdown in less than three minutes, this time from five yards out. Henesey leads the team this season with five rushing touch downs. The touchdown run was set up by passes from Hatajik to Dan Scocca '91 and Pape of nine and 16 yards respectively. Hatajik was able to connect with Walsh in the endzone for a two-point conversion bringing the score to 27-24. Bucknell began again at its own 34-yard line, with just under seven minutes to play. The Bison were able to march the distance of the field while successfully manag ing the clock. During the 12-play scoring drive, Hatajik threw only three times, all for completions, including a 15-yard connection with Lester Erb *91. Henesey ran the ball six times for 23 yards including a six-yard gain on a fourth down and one. The winning score occurred when Hatajik scrambled into the endzone. The extra point was missed, leaving the score at 30-27. It was Todd Krutch- ko ffs '91 first extra point miss since the first game of the season. His 31 consecutive conversions are a Bucknell school record. Lehigh began its last chance at a score by returning the kickoff to the Bucknell 43-yard line. The Engineers marched the ball down to the 16-yard line, giving Erik"

Bird a 33-yard field goal opportu nity into a stiff wind with only five seconds remaining on the clock. His kick fell short, and the Bison had successfully staged their most dramatic come from behind victory in years. The last time the Bison had erased a deficit as large as 18 points came in 1986, when Buck nell battled back from a 29-10 half time deficit against Colgate to win the game 40-39. The game began badly as Lehigh took the opening kickoff and drove 57 yards in 12 plays, cul minating on a five-yard touchdown run by Tom Cunningham. Lehigh drove most of the way on the ground, which was surprising, con sidering it brought the nation's (Division I-A A) second-leading passing attack into the game. Bucknell set up its first score later in the quarter, as Mike Augs- berger '91 intercepted a pass and returned it two yards to the Lehigh 25-yard line.

sparks football controversy,"good being able to bounce back-- that's what we're trying to teach. It's the most important lesson of athletics. 1 know that sounds trite, but that's what we did."" As far as the entire season was concerned, Marsh stated, ""We had an up-and-down year, but I think it shows promise for the future and for indoor track."" Again, Gulden saw the situa tion in a similar light. ""It was a good year, not great, but we only had that one bad race,"" he said. "" Unfortunately, it was conferences, [the Patriot League Champion ships] but that happens."" The men's team, however, did not enjoy similar success. Fin ishing last out of the IC4A field, the Bucknell men failed to qualify for nationals. Gulden said, ""We were disap pointed. Obviously, we expected more. We picked a bad time to have a bad race. Sometimes you run a flat one, and this was our flat one."" The men experienced a few extra difficulties, as runners Jeff Loomis '92 and Bob Kelly '92 both fell at the start of the race, losing at least ten yards form the leaders, and causing them to get stuck in the back of the pack. ""We had some bad luck,"" said Gulden, ""but even so we weren't aggressive enough."" Despite this last loss, Gulden See C R O S S-C O U N T R Y , page 19 By Darren Millman Staff Writer When Arizona voters arrived at the polls on Tuesday, Nov. 6, the ballot included two propositions which would have made Arizona the 48th state to accept a Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. Proposition 301 gave voters an opportunity to accept King's birthday as a holi day, while strip- ping Columbus Day of its holiday status. Proposi tion 302 simply stated the declar ation of King Day as a holiday. Prop. 301 was rejected by a 3-1 -- -- -- -- margin, while Prop. 302 fell 15,000 votes short of a majority. In what is a powerful state ment of the prevalence of athletics in all facets o f our society, this issue has been adopted primarily by the sports community as a vehicle through which to exert political influence. Immediately following the voting results, N FL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue released a statement which indicated that he would ask the N FL owners to take punitive measures against the state by mov ing the site o f the 1993 Super Bowl from Phoenix, as had originally been determined. In the statement Tagliabue commented, ""With the holiday ref erenda having been rejected Tues day I do not believe that playing Super Bowl X X V II in Arizona is in the best interest o f the N FL."" The Sunkist Fiesta Bowl, held in Tempe, Arizona, is suffer ing more immediate blows as a result of the widespread repercussions. This post-season college foot ball contest has a payoff o f $2.5 million for each team, and has hosted N C A A  title games in 1987 and 1989. Fiesta Bowl organizers' con cerns have been substantiated by the indicated intent of Virginia and Penn State, both previously proba ble Fiesta competitors, to attend other post-season contests. Virginia has expressed the intent to compete in the richer U SF& G Sugar Bowl in New Orleans, while Penn State will apparently receive almost $1 mil-"

In attempts to rectify a possi bly disastrous situation, Fiesta Bowl Executive Director John Junker announced Tuesday that an additional _ _ _ _ _ $100,000 would be given to each school, to be used towards a minority scholar ship fund or to endow a chair for minority -- -- -- -- students. The bowl agenda, Junker explained, will include a pregame ceremony honoring the 200th anni versary of the Bill of Rights as well as a halftime ceremony in remem brance of Dr. King. Bucknell Sports Information Director Bo Smolka sympathizes with the Fiesta Bowl personnel's predicament, stating, ""The Fiesta Bowl is put in a bad position because they didn't have anything to do with the voting and actually they have a good track record in terms o f hiring minorities in man agement positions and such."" It is worth noting that the Fiesta Bowl has given its staff a paid Martin Luther King holiday each of the last two years. With Louisville having already expressed its intent to par ticipate in the New Year's Day game, Fiesta officials fully expect the South Eastern Conference run ner-up to accept a bid as well. Going into the final weeks of regu lar season competition, the SEC standings are still undetermined. Any one of four teams, Ten nessee, Missis sippi, Auburn, or Alabama could finish as SEC _____________________ runner-up. Ten- nessee and Mis sissippi will put the conference title and a trip to the Sugar Bowl on the line when they square-off in Knox ville this weekend. Louisville (9-1-1) had been prepared to accept a bid to the All- American Bowl in Birmingham, posal, while others in the sports world have criticized the NFL extensively. There are those who feel the NFL has overstepped its boundar ies by entering the political arena. ESPN commentator and former NFL quarterback Joe Theismann exclaimed, 'The NFL owners are trying to dictate political policy to the state. It's blackmail."" Chris Berman, host of ESPN's NFL Gameday, lashed out at the league stating, ""The N FL is open to hypocrisy. They say no to the Super Bowl in Phoenix, yet take the money from Cardinals' home games."" Smolka echoed these senti ments by remarking, ""I don't think [the NFL] can move the Super Bowl from [Phoenix], while they still have an NFL team there. There seems to be an inconsistency."" Bucknell football coach Lou Maranzana gave his assessment of the situation by stating, 'The NFL is still a money-making organiza- -- ... lion and what they are doing is covering their public relations backsides because they are"

Tagliabue's recommendation to strip Arizona of the 1993 Super Bowl has become an issue of great controversy. Several NFL owners have expressed their intention to go along with the commissioner's pro- to mately going to them in dollars and mean cents."" While the Fiesta Bowl seems to have weathered the ini tial storm, the controversy cer tainly does not appear to have been completely resolved.

U.N. authorizes the use of force in the Gulf; students to,
protest 4 to 5:30 p.m. today at Post Office,"By Michael M cGandy Staff Writer The United Nations Security Council voted twelve to two, with one abstention, in favor o f using ""all necessary means"" to remove Iraq from Kuwait, if they do not voluntarily leave by January 15th, has caused the peace movement on campus to alter their approach. According to Sarah Pryor '92 of Students and Teachers Organized for Peace (S.T.O.P.), Thursday's Security Council resolution shifted the organization's focus to the task of explicitly promoting peaceful alternatives in the face of the increasing national momentum toward war. While recognizing that given the U.N. backing of the latest step in the Persian Gulf Crisis their voice of protest is likely to be in the minority, late this week members of S.T.O.P. undertook projects encouraging the community to question the course of events unfolding in the Persian Gulf. On Thursday morning stu dents found the academic quad chalked with messages written by S.T.O.P. concerning the composi tion and purpose of the U.N. forces in the Persian Gulf. Today, in response to the Security Council vote, a banner was erected on the lawn between the Langone Center and Marts Hall and a demonstration and candle-light vigil is to be held from 4 to 5:30 p.m. in front of the post office on Market Street The ends S.T.O.P. hopes to achieve through its efforts, accord ing to member Stephen Leshinski '91, are varied but there are two foci; one of which is to do what is realistically possible to prevent mil itary conflict in the Persian Gulf. The second is to develop a commu nity of persons against war in the Gulf. ""Right now we are establish ing a voice so, if there is a war, people will look back to November and see that at the very beginning there were people in opposition,"" Leshinski said. With the engage ment of the conflict Leshinski believes that opposition will rise and that it is important at the present moment to create a founda tion upon which future action can be taken. The beginning of such a com munity of opposition began two weeks ago when S.T.O.P. orga nized a week o f demonstrations and educational forums which culmi nated in a day-long ""teach-in"" on Saturday Nov. 17 which discussed the many political, cultural, and economic facets of the conflict in the Persian Gulf. The proceedings of the day were covered by local network affiliates and televised that night. Members of S.T.O .P. are also concerned that students are not tak ing the conflict with Iraq seriously. Mollie Janota '91 stated that ""peo ple are still not willing to think that war is a real possibility."" Yet, See S.T .O .P ., page 2"
Summer program attracts,
diverse group of students,"By Tara Gilligan Staff Writer O f the 25 students from the Community College of Philadel- phia(CCP) who attended Buck- nell's summer school session, four transferred this Fall and another seven will arrive in the Spring. Using a $25,000 Ford Foundation grant, Bucknell sponsored this sum mer school program in affiliation with CCP. The four students who now attend Bucknell are Alonzo Pride, Colleen Lyttleton, Anwar Aberra, and Juarrannetta McNabb. The program, modeled after a similar one set up at Vassar Col lege, gave minority and low- income students an opportunity to study at a four-year private institu tion. ""The intent of the program was to identify students at commu nity colleges whose achievements indicated that they were capable of finishing a bachelor's degree,"" said Richard Smith, professor of Eng lish and coordinator of the project. Smith pointed out that most of the students involved in the pro gram were capable of succeeding at a four-year college, but because of financial or familial limitations, had not considered the possibility. These students would end their education with associate degrees. The summer program ""intro duced them to the atmosphere of a private four-year school by having See S U M M E R , page 2 By Andrew Cohen Staff Writer The near riot on Halloween may generate arrests said Lewis burg Police Chief Donald Heiter.

Heiter defended police con duct, as well as the lack of arrests to date at a Borough Council meet ing Tuesday November 20. He explained later that ""there were a lot of things to consider.

We went out and campaigned and changed opinions by convinc ing them to give money where they wanted to give it."" Maggie Rislow, assistant director of Annual Giving, gives credit to Daniels and his staff for their organizing and campaigning of this project, ""The coordinators and volunteers have worked really hard on this, and that's why it has been successful."" The remaining 24.2% of the senior class will be contacted next semester about pledging. Since September 16, the Gift Drive's 15 coordinators and well over 100 other volunteers have been organizing the drive and cam paigning for pledges. Because tuition covers only 70% of the costs for attending Bucknell, the Senior Gift Drive is especially important. Rislow explained, ""The point of the Senior the charge, and we were looking for the cooperation o f the students and administration."" Heiter did say that he hoped students understood "" there'll not be a second! If they didn't understand that we meant business, fine."" Laura Messier, a member of the Town/Gown Committee who called in the original complaint, explained that although the situa tion was problematic for the police, different things might have been done. ""Everybody was really glad that nobody got hurt, that there was no baton bashing. The only prob lem was that there really wasn't law and order."" Messier also ques tioned the original handling of the situation. ""Within 45 minutes the number of students increased from 300 to about 500... The police made no attempt to cordon off the area to keep the crowd from grow ing. They could have reduced the number by almost half."" ""My perception was that when President Sojka came the whole tone of the thing changed,"" said Messier. In terms o f the calls for a harder line, she noted, ""If laws are broken and he's aware of it, he has to take action, and many many laws were broken."" At the same time, Messier said that she understood, "" Simply arresting a bunch of students wouldn't have solved anything."" Messier, who was outspoken at the Council meeting, thought that the arrests were "" too much after the fact I think it's kind of like locking the bam door after the horse is out."" Heiter stressed the educa tional value of such an experience, and he hopes students have learned the risks involved in breaking the law in town. He explained that the police department receives weekly requests for the records of former students. "" [A criminal record] could put them out of a good job some time in the future."" Messier said that the overall "" town reaction"" would be "" very difficult to assess, because the next scheduled town/gown meeting isn't until January."" She did say that "" it's causing us to put more pres sure on the university to try to get the residency requirement stricter. As a result of what happened, we put forth a proposal to ask them [the administration] why they can't do it in [impose the residency requirement] 1991."" Heiter explained that no cam pus raids were likely in the future. "" We go on campus any time we're called. We do patrol once in a while..."" He explained that they could be called by "" Bucknell Security, East Buffalo Township Police, the LCB  (Liquor Control Board), or the State Police."" One consequence of police involvement on campus according to Heiter is that, ""Where we get called, we will be the ones to issue the citations..."""

"diversity, curriculum","See G IF T  D R IV E , page 2 By Lisa Hirschkorn Staff Writer With her speech, ""The Mean ing of Cultural Literacy in a Multi cultural Society,"" Dr. Karen Bojar advocated curriculum reform amidst the fierce educational debates occurring at Universities across the country, including Buck nell. Dr. Bojar, associate professor of English at the Community Col lege of Philadelphia, addressed the key issue and criticism surrounding a core curriculum versus an integra tion of perspectives, while focusing on the views of best-selling authors Allen Bloom and E.D. Hirsch at the Olin Science Auditorium on Mon day night. The national consensus that our curriculum must become more multicultural is growing, but the perspective from which these tradi tions should be taught is the emerg ing battleground, in which the issue of cultural literacy is the first battle to be won. ""Should the U.S. exist as an American culture to which all groups must more or less adapt, or should it be viewed as a multicultu ral society comprised of a wide range of ethnic groups with no one group in a position of cultural dom inance? This is the underlying ques tion,"" Bojar said. ""And it is no coin cidence that the debate over cultural literacy has erupted as our society becomes increasingly anxious over changing demographics,"" Bojar added. She explained that the major reform movements in American education occurred during periods of increasing cultural diversity. The two beginning phases of educational reform, in the 1840's and at the turn of the twentieth cen tury, were motivated by fears of diverse groups assimilating into the society. This first phase, known as the Common School Movement, involved Irish immigrants, and the second phase was motivated by concerns about assimilating immi grant workers from Southern and Eastern Europe. These xenophobic fears which our ancestors possessed have largely prompted the contemporary debate over cultural literacy. The term Cultural Literacy, which Bojar and her colleagues implemented back in 1985, has acquired vast political dimensions and ""unfortu nately, these issues are frequently presented on a simplistic left-right terms."" ""We were regarded as reac tionaries,"" Bojar explained. ""Most people found cultural literacy as a code for right-wing agenda. Wc were greatly relieved when support See B O JA R , page 3"

Students will fight,
if war breaks out,"By Tara Gilligan Staff Writer Although Congress has not revived talks of a military draft, the possibility of one has become a consideration in light of the cur rent Persian Gulf crisis. In the event of a draft laws passed by Congress in the early seventies would go into affect. According to Secuon 456 of I the selective service law, passed in 1971. an individual pursuing a degree at a college or university I would be able to ""have his induc tion postponed until the end of the semester or term, or academic year in the case of his last aca demic year."" Prior to President Nixon signing into law a revision of draft procedures, college stu- j dents could defer their enrollment until after graduation. College students enrolled in I ROTC would not have to leave school to fight. Students attending v____________________________ school on a ROTC scholarship have agreed to a year of training following graduation and could not be expected to serve until after completion. Few options would allow an individual to evade the draft. If a person conscientiously objects to war, if he refuses to go based on religious beliefs, he would be given non-combatant duties. A conscientious objector would not be trained in the use of firearms, but would serve in a civilian role. A person in the seminary preparing for priesthood could be deferred from training. Addition ally. persons ""whose activity in study, research ... or other endeav ors is found to be ncccssarv to the maintenance of the national health safety or interest"" would be exempt from serving in the selec tive service. This section refers primarily to professional occupa tions such as medicine or dentistrv."
Summer,"From page 1 them take two courses which would be team-taught by members of the community college and the host,"" Smith explained. The program was aimed at providing opportunities for what Smith referred to as ""differently prepared students."" By this he meant minority students, single mothers, and older students. Of the seven students transferring in the spring, three are single mothers. Faculty at Bucknell and CCP reviewed the 140 applicants for the program. Beaver College in Phila delphia also sponsored a similar transfer program. Students applied for both programs simultaneously, and CCP faculty recommended them for one of the two programs. As part of the application process, student interviews were videotaped. ^Students sent tran scripts and wrote three essays. Faculty from both schools decided to invite 25 students, and an addi tional 11 were placed on a waiting list. Before transferring in the fall, students had to apply to the office of admissions. Alonzo Pride, who trans ferred to Bucknell after completing the summer program, graduated from CCP and began working as a counselor in shelters. To work as a counselor in a school. Pride needed a teaching certificate. ""I needed first of all more knowledge about counseling than 1 had received...and to be certified to teach,"" he said. The four CCP students who enrolled in the fall all attended the summer program. Students had to take two of three courses team- taught by Bucknell and CCP faculty. The three courses offered were social justice, math and engi neering. and environmental science. In addition to classes, stu dents attended workshops given by the financial aid, admissions, and career development offices. For students who transferred in the fall, the summer program was a transition into a faster work pace than they had been accus tomed to. ""It gets you to adjust to college at a slower pace. It kind of gave us confidence,"" said Pride. Students who transferred did receive some credit for courses taken at CCP. .AH entered Bucknell as advanced freshmen. Pride will be able to graduate after three years. Credits from core courses such as math, history, English and psychology, transferred. ""They didn't take anything that you don't teach here, but they took all of the core courses,"" he said. Pride noted the difference between his courses at CCP and Bucknell. ""The course work [at Bucknell] is more difficult I think it would be more difficult than most four-year colleges. I would compare CCP to an average four - year school, say a state school,"" he said. According to Smith, Buck nell worked with CCP for several reasons. ""They had a president at that time, Judith Eaton, who was very, very interested in transfer programs, w ho was, in fact, nation ally recognized as a leader among community college presidents for her work in transfer programs,"" he said. In addition, CCP ""enrolls more minority students than all of the community colleges in the state of Pennsylvania put together,"" said Smith. ""Ford had already provided a grant to Vassar College over a number of years to pioneer the pro gram, Smith said. The Vassar pro gram, which began with 25 stu dents, has doubled in size. Ford invited Bucknell to apply for the grant. Schools com peted for a total of five grants. The schools Ford provided grants for included Hamilton, Agnes College, Lewis and Clark, and Smith."
S.T.O.P.,"From page 1 Janota thinks that the Security Council resolution may serve to make the weight of the situation more palpable to students. With the passage of the U.N. resolution concerning Iraq, many members of S.T.O.P. arc convinced that the nation is headed to war. ""The whole course of events shows that we arc going to war,"" Janota said. ""The rapid decision to send so much money and so many people to Saudi Arabia, the efforts to bol ster these actions in the U.N., and the lack of any attempt at a nego tiated settlement all suggest our commitment to conflict"" Lcshinski stated that he was ""completely convinced that George Bush was wholly in favor of an offensive action in Kuwait"" and that he believed that United States action would not stop there. ""I think we are set on war and the Security Council resolution will only dictate the story that we are to be told about how the armed con flict began."" S.T.O.P is particularly inter ested in being critical of terms such as U.N. forces"" and ""U.N. action"" in light of the fact that American troops compose the vast majority of those present in the Gulf. In response to what he considered to be a misleading belief that the con flict in the Persian Gulf was a U.N. action. Professor of Economics and member of S.T.O.P.. Dean Baker, said, ""This recent resolution is not a U.N. action at all, but a document which will allow the United States to take direct action in the region."" There have been criticisms on campus that S.T.O.P., in its efforts to promote peace, has not fully con sidered the danger that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein presents economi cally and militarily, especially in terms of Iraq's potential for nuclear capability. Niki Markley '92 stated that she believed that it was precisely the seriousness of these issues that demanded that other methods of conflict resolution be attempted. ""There are alternatives to war, yet people still think that violence is a means to solve these problems,"" Markley said. ""We should give sanctions more time to work and then pursue a mediated solution conducted by nation without a vested interest in the region."" Both Janota and Leshinski agreed that Iraqi actions need to be opposed, but questioned what could be achieved through using military action. ""In terms of the aggression against Kuwait, I agree that it was a terrible thing,"" Janota said. ""Yet to go to war would be even more destructive to both human beings and the resources of the region; it w ould be very much like destroying the place to preserve it"" S.T.O.P., according to Leshinski, is asking people to ques tion our involvement in the Persian Gulf more deeply. ""The questions people are asking about Hussein are fair, but I ask them to know the whole story,"" Leshinski said, sug gesting the previous American involvement with the Hussein regime. ""There is an entire story around what is going on and many people are not aware of it."" In terms of Iraq with Hussein as its leader being a nuclear threat in the region, Janota said that the danger is overemphasized. Citing the nuclear capability of the sur rounding nations and forces of Israel, the Soviet Union, and the United States, Janota stated that the immediate and disastrous escalation that the use of nuclear weapons por tends would deny Hussein the option of their use. ""Hussein is ruthless, but he is not crazy,"" she said."

524-4050,"Gift Drive is to start the tradition of alumni support"" by informing the students of how the allocated money is used. It is easiest to con tact the students for pledges while they are still attending the univer sity. Through the help of other alumni, these students were able to attend Bucknell. Often times these students want to do the same for current Bucknell students after they have graduated. The money for pledges taken in this drive will be collected over the next five years and used in the current operating budget of the four categories. Those pledging could allo cate their money to one of four broad categories. These categories included the Annual fund, the Engi neering fund, the Bison Club fund, and the Association for the Arts fund. The Annual fund is the most encompassing category and covers such items as basic operating costs, financial aid, new computers, scholarships, and departmental bud gets. If they wished, students could even allocate money more specifi cally within the Annual fund to only the English department, for example, or only for scholarships. The Engineering fund aids in the need to up-date technology. By keeping its engineering department up-dated, Bucknell hopes to attract high caliber professors and keep its engineering major competitive with other universities. The Bison Club fund supports the athletic depart ment Its monies are used for such purposes as travel to games or play offs and recruiting. The Associa tion for the Arts fund subsidizes the performances at the Weis Center and allows for lower ticket prices for students and faculty members attending these performances. For pledging a certain amount of money, some students received tokens of appreciation. Those who pledged S250 received a '91 Senior Gift Drive T-shirt. Those pledging $500 had their name entered in a drawing done in Colorado through Ann Schimmel, a Bucknell alumni. The drawing is for a trip for two to the Bahamas through the company Travclcon- nections. The winner of this trip will be announced at the senior class party to be held 91 days before graduation."

Fee hikes prompt,
trustee debate,"By Andrew Cohen !Staff Writer Last week's biannual meet ing of the Board of Trustees 'sparked controversy and heated !debate on the issue of student fee !increases for the coming year. The !trustees met November 16-17 and !faced ""the most difficult issue that #a trustee can face,"" according to dames Nevels, a member of the !board. ; The trus s e s  were asked !to pass the 'faculty's pro posed 6.93% !increase in the !comprehensive !fee which 'includes tuition, #room and board. !Instead, accord ing to Novels, !""The administra ro n  is going to go back and we're going to !look at a tuition !increase that approximates the level of inflation"" which is currently around 4.5%. Nevels explained that the proposal had to be viewed in the context of two key issues, ""First, demo graphics; the number of col lege age students is dwindling. Secondly, our competition is increasing. Bucknell's level endowment, while not small, not Harvard's...."" These two issues serve work against each other, according to Nevels. In a time of decreasing Remand and increased competi tion, .Buckncll's ""budget is primar- ily a tuition driven budget."" Nevels described the job of a trustee viewing the decision as a ""balancing act.... We want to keep moving in the right direction, and we must ask what is the level of tuition increase that is acceptable on the one hand and necessary [to operate a university] on the other."" Another issue Nevels dis cussed was that of a fixed increase versus a floating increase in fees. By setting the increase in rela tion to the infla tion rate, the university assures itself of not losing money. For example, if inflation went up to 8%, a fixed increase of 6.93% would result in an actual loss in fees for the university. Nevels defended the charge of con troversy by explaining that ""you find your self in a situa tion where year we go through this question of what to do with tuition. We always have a intense discussion and this was no C. Bridgewater/The BKN every Trustee James Nevels analyzed the various issues surrounding the ongoing debate over increas ing fees. of is to very, very about that, exception."" The apparent cuts in the pro posed increases will necessarily affect one of two major budget additions that the faculty had asked for: 25 more professor posi tions, and faculty raises."
University sponsors lecture series,
on Gregg Township incinerator,"By Bob Ritter Staff Writer The two sides in the contro versial Gregg Township hazardous waste incinerator proposal met face-to-face Nov. 20 in Vaughan Lit. Auditorium in a informational forum sponsored by the University and coordinated by Michael LaGrcga, professor of civil engi neering. The lecture, the second in a continuing series, featured separ ate presentations by Anthony Done- telli, president of USPCI Pennsyl vania, Inc., the company proposing the incinerator plan, and Clyde Peeling, local naturalist and founder of Organizations United for the Environment (OUE), the cit izens' group spearheading opposi tion to the incinerator. A question and answer period followed the presentations. Donctelli's portion of the program focused on the criteria involved in the selection of the site, as well as a technical discussion of how the incineration process works. Donctelli explained that USPCI chose the site in Gregg Township, located in northern Union County north of the village of Allcnwood, because the com pany wanted a site with approxi mately 500 to 1000 acres of land suitable for the development of an adjacent industrial park, which also had good access to major highways and railroads, in an ""area which could benefit from long-term growth."" In addition, he said that the property must be properly zoned and available for purchase by USPCI. Most importantly, Don ated explained, the location must meet ""some of the most rigorous siting criteria in the country"" set by the state Department of Environ mental Resources (DER). He con cluded by explaining that there were six sites in five counties which met these ""extremely limited criteria,"" including another site in Friday, November 30 9:00 am - 5:00 pm"

Audio Equipment,"b e / o w c o s t / Union County, and that the Gregg Township site was selected from that list. Donatelli also defined the types of waste the facility would accept, a list which includes paint residues, contaminated soil (such as that around leaking underground gasoline tanks), unused pesticides and herbicides, petroleum wastes, household chemicals, and chemical wastes from industries such as dry cleaning, printing, and wood finishing. Donatelli then outlined the DER permitting procedure for the facility, which is a two-step process in which DER first determines the suitability of the site, after which the developer, USPCI, can submit a formal permit application, which is then reviewed and acted upon. According to Donatelli, the entire process normally takes three to five years. In addition, Donatelli explained USPCI's ""attempts to establish a working relationship with groups"" in the area. He said that these attempts have included mailing out 4,000 information packets and newsletters and hold ing a general public meeting last month. Donatelli also said the com pany has met with local officials and held regular meetings for the local media, as well as meetings with other interested groups and organizations and door-to-door contact with area citizens. Dr. Joseph Santoleri, a con sultant employed by USPCI for the project, then explained some of the more technical details of hazardous waste incineration. He explained that the process ""uses high temper- ature oxidation"" in which the haz ardous organic compounds are fractured, with the inorganic com ponents left as ash, which will be stored on-site in an above-ground monofill. Federal standards, Santo- leri said, require the incinerator have ""a 99.99 percent destructive removal efficiency"" of organic compounds, and that the emission control system must have a 99 per cent scrubbing efficiency for hydrogen chloride, a volatile chem ical which, when released into the air, can mix with water to form acid rain. In addition, Santoleri explained that, as a condition for licensing, the plant must undergo a ""stack test"" in which emissions are tested in a ""worst case scenario,"" in which the burning temperature and type of waste are set for maxi mum levels of dangerous emis sions. Santoleri also explained that the stack must feature continuous monitoring for carbon monoxide, total hydrocarbons, hydrogen chlo ride, oxygen, and opacity (whether the stack emission is clear). Peeling took a totally differ ent approach in his presentation, claiming that the key issue is ""what's the character of the people involved, the track record of the company, [and] the track record of the industry."" Addressing Dona- telli directly, he said, ""Your involvement with Walter Norley suggests a tone of subterfuge and deceit."" Norley, a principal owner of Pennwood Development Corpora tion, purchased the land for the 700 acre site from the various owners. USPCI, in turn, purchased the entire tract from Pennwood, and the company claims that this was their first contact with Norley. Peel ing and OUE, however, claim that Norley served as a front man for USPCI, so that the land could be purchased without the plans for the site being known, a claim Norley and USPCI refute. Peeling, how ever, noted that Pennwood shares the same phone number as Environ mental Services, Inc., a consulting firm in which Donatelli is one of the principals. Peeling also claimed that USPCI prevented a member of OUE from taking a soil sample at the site. Peeling outlined numerous safety violations by USPCI at other facilities it owns, which included ""at least 40 violations between April 1984 and May 1987."" Peeling also noted that some sites owned by Union Pacific, USPCI's parent company, are on the Environmental Protection Agency's federal ""super fund"" list of the most contaminated sites in the nation. After elaborating on several of USPCI's violations, Peeling concluded that the company ""has a pattern of non-compliance and negotiations for lower fines."" He also noted that the mayor of Logan Township, New Jersey, where a similar hazardous waste incinerator is located, told OUE members, ""It can't do your commu nity any good."" In conclusion, Peeling said, ""The track record of this industry is not a pretty picture. We're not will ing to take a chance with USPCI; your political connections don't impress us.... This incinerator poses a risk to the entire population of this valley, [and] you choose to impose that risk on us."" Sun.-Thurs. 11-9 Fri. & Sat. 11-10"
Bojar,"From page 1 for cultural literacy came from an unexpected source--Abbie Hoff man."" Although Hoffman never used the term ""cultural literacy"" himself, Bojar spoke of Hoffman's interview with National Public Radio, right before his death, where he complained that American stu dents were ignorant of their own history. Hoffman remarked, ""Peo ple say things to me like I know who Martin Luther King is because I watched this television show, Eyes on the Prize , but tell me who is this guy Malcolm the tenth [Malcolm X]?"" This fiery curriculum debate is usually, but not always, drawn along left-right terms, explained Bojar. Support for the canon, for instance, is largely derived from the right-wingers, those who aspire to an Allen Bloom/William Bennett philosophy. Bloom is the author of the best-selling book, The Closing o f the American Mind, which espoused the need for ""canonical works,"" and a return to cultural tra dition. Bloom's views also identify with those of William Bennett, the former Secretary of Education, and Ronald Reagan. However, E.D. Hirsch, a pro fessor at the University of Virginia, politically lies to the left of Bloom. In his best-selling book, Cultural Literacy, he also focused on the importance of a historical back ground, and included a 5,000-word list of dates, places, phrases, terms, and concepts which he believed informed citizens should know. According to Bojar, ""Hirsch dem onstrated that literacy, with all of its fundamentals, does have a cultural dimension. Writers take certain his torical information for granted, and readers who do not possess this information suffer a great gap in communication. Although the very term cultural literacy is problematic in a multicultural society, Hirsch had done us a service in pointing"

""Con cerned with a broad-based demo cratic leadership,"" Hirsch is sensi tive ""to women, minorities, economically-disadvantaged, and an unusually extreme aversion to Ronald Reagan."" Bojar believes that Hirsch has been a ""victim of his books and success"" because people associate his name only with his infamous list, and ignore the rest of his book. Hirsch's list ""doesn't go far enough"" and con jures up images of teachers forcing their students to memorize what she calls ""a list of 5000 things that savvy folk ought to know."" While critics tend to conflate the differences between Hirsch and Bloom, Bojar asserts that she is struck by the differences between the two men. ""How many people have actually gotten through Allen Bloom's Closing of the American Mined"" Bojar asked her audience. ""It happens to be the least-read best-seller of all time."" According to Bojar, ""Bloom focuses on the privileged few. He openly states in the introduction to his book that his concern is with college students and professors, a cadre of elite stu dents."" Bloom is interested in schools like Bucknell but not in schools like Bojar's, a community college. One good point on Bloom, Bojar said, is his attack on relati vism. Using the analogy of a stu dent who claims ""well, it's just my opinion"" Bojar explained that a stu dent does need criteria for her opin ion. And Bloom establishes this cri teria with his emphasis on canonical works. Despite criticisms of the canonical works, ""the books we are supposed to have read,"" Bojar believes that curriculum reform should maintain a canon because of its universal value. ""How is literary value established? Who decides what a masterpiece is going to be?"" asked Bojar. Bojar herself is not yet ready to abandon the canon or the notion of universal value. She claims there is ""some reason why certain works have spoken to so many people across generations. Yet, recent work in the humanities and social sciences has discredited the notion of an unchanging universal human nature."" For example, Bojar said ""the racism of Huckleberry Finn, the anti-semitism of The Merchant o f Venice and the misogyny of Par adise Lost "" are the charges against the classic books which most Americans regard as masterpieces. She said that at ""more cutting edge graduate schools such as Duke courses in westerns and Avon romances proliferate."" She sees diminishing distinctions between high and low cultures and added, ""Stephen King has started to creep into contemporary literature courses."" ""Classic works can be found outside the mainstream,"" Bojar asserted in addressing the value of inclusivity. 'There are works that are classics of African-American literature and of Native-American literature which demand the same attention as Huckleberry Finn and The Scarlet Letter."" The ultimate question lies in how these new perspectives will be mandated and expanded into the college curriculum. 'The hot issue is now becoming the perspective from which these views are taught. Until recently, the quarrel over the place of Western classics has been restricted to primarily elite institu tions such as Stanford but now it seems to be shifting toward public universities."" Bojar used the recent actions by the New York Education task force to illustrate one possible rem edy for this problem of exclusivity. In rather blunt language, the task force proposed a new curriculum concentrating on the contributions of minorities to correct the ""mis- education of all known people through a systematic bias to a Euro pean culture and its derivatives."" The report aims at criticizing and de-emphasizing both the impact and the institutions of American history. Yet Bojar is uneasy about a separatist approach which empha sizes the history and perceptions of one particular ethnic group. ""In conclusion, I want to embrace diversity but I would also like to see some shared knowledge base __ a broader more culturally diverse core but a core nonetheless. I want my students to have access to tradi tional classics, and I want a broad range of new voices--in short I want it all."" page 4"

Senate urges,
caution in Gulf,"During hearings of the Sen ate's Armed Services Committee, Democratic members urged Presi dent George Bush to delay taking military action in the Persian Gulf and to give economic sanctions more time to work. Senator Sam Nunn of Geor gia, the committee chairman, ques tioned the need for rushing into combat with Iraq, concerns that were generally echoed by the other Democratic members. James Schlesinger, former Defense Secretary in the Nixon Administration and CIA chief, said that sanctions would accomplish the goal of getting Iraq to with draw from Kuwait if the Admin- stration would give them a chance. He estimated that the sanctions would have to be applied for about one year for the policy to work. Schlesinger testified before the Senate committee. ""In three months time, civil ian production in Iraq is estimated to have declined by some 40 per- cent,"" said Schlesinger. ""Oil exports are essentially nil and export earnings have dropped cor respondingly. The hoard of hard currency, necessary to sustain smuggling, is dwindling away. The economic pressure can only grow worse."""

Later Tuesday morning, in apparent retribution for the kill ings, the Israeli air force bombed the headquarters of two Palestin ian guerrilla groups based in southern Lebanon. Five people were reported to be wounded. The fighting came just after Israel finished burying its dead from a terrorist attack on its south ern border. On Sunday, an Egyp tian border policeman opened fire on vehicles passing bn a highway, killing four and wounding 26."

Bank board,
chair testifies,"Edwin Gray, the former chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, testified before the Senate Ethics Committee Tues day, and recounted in detail how he had been summoned to a meeting in Senator Dennis DiConcini's office and had found himself sur rounded by four Senators seeking help for Charles Keating, former head of Lincoln Savings and Loan. The meeting has become cen tral to the Ethics Committee's inquiry into the conduct of the four Senators who attended. Senators DcConcini, Alan Cranston of Cali fornia, John McCain of Arizona, and John Glenn of Ohio confronted Gray during this meeting. According to Gray, DiCon- cici asked him on behalf of the four senators to withdraw a federal regu lation to limit the ability of Lincoln and other savings and loans to make speculative investments. Gray's account of the meet ing has been disputed by the sena tors themselves."
Fuel fire extin,
guished in Colo.,
A,"huge fire that burned unchecked for two days was extin guished Wednesday at Denver's Sta pleton Airport with the help of fire fighting specialists from Texas. Two jet fuel tanks had been on fire since Monday. The fire had begun when two 400,000-gal Ion tanks erupted in flame Sunday. The four tanks, containing more than two million gallons of jet fuel, were part of the airport's fuel storage farm. The storage area is about one- half mile north of the airport's terminal. Water and foam sprays were trained on an 800,000-gallon tank that was one-third to one-half full of jet fuel and a tank that held 350,000 gallons of fuel. Firefighters attempted to keep the burning tanks cool so that a five-man team flown to Denver from Texas could get close in order to seal broken valves on the tanks. The sprays worked better than expected -- they put out the flames."
Oil spill cleanup,
nearly done,"Ernest Piper, Alaska's oil spill coordinator, said that about 85 percent of the shoreline fouled by the Exxon Valdez oil spill has been sufficiently cleaned. Piper announcement came as the state released its cleanup plan for 1991. Piper said that the state does not contend that the sites are pris tine, but that everything that can be done to clean the areas has been done. The 1991 plan, intended to clarify what areas Alaska believes still need treatment, repeats the state's contention that Exxon should be finished with the cleanup by the end of the year. Exxon has spent more that S2.2 billion on the cleanup and has paid more than S240 million in damage claims from the spill."
Yale keeps its Ilf.,
m agazine,"Benno Schmidt, president of Yale University, has decided to rescind his decision to halt publication of the school's literary magazine, The Yale Review. Schmidt said he plans to seek to revitalize the magazine, which had been suffering from declinig advertizing revenue. The plan to terminate the magazine was widely criticized by writers, who consider the publica tion one of the country's best liter ary quarterlys."
Police continue,
rape inquiry,"Police continue to investigate the alleged rape at a fraternity party at the University of Rhode Island and the death of another student who was reported to be linked to the case. A female student said she was raped by a man at the party while others watched. The woman identified the attacker. He was arrested and charged with rape, but was released and the charges were dropped because the woman testi fied at the bail hearing that she had been drunk and was unsure of the details of the attack. A man who was among those said to have witnessed the alleged attack was found shot on the day he was to have spoken to state and campus police about the incident: Michael Lindcll died at a local hos pital. A police spokesman said the wound may have been self-inflicted. An investigation is continuing."

Bucknellian,"page 5 Photo by Debra Cook Chris Kaufman reherses for her piece titled,""With God and Gladys."" Kaufman is a guest artist here at Bucknell this semester. Both Kauf man and Lisa Coffman, Bucknell's Poet in Residence are lending their talents to the Dance Co.'s performance. By Danna Frangione Live vicariously this season with a feisty, fast paced Bucknell Dance Company conceit featuring tongue-in-cheek tap, irreverent jazz and delicately moody modem bal let. The fall season performances will ran next Friday and Saturday in the University Theatre in Cole man Hall. The performances repre sent an ambitious semester of guest residencies and lengthy rehearsals for the cast of twenty-one students and faculty. Highlighting the concert is a premier by guest artist-in-residence Chris Kaufman, who joins forces with Bucknell Resident Poet Lisa Coffman in presenting ""With God and Gladys."" An experimental piece with harsh overtones, the dance explores the tenuous connec tions between mind and body. Kaufman, with Bucknell seniors Tina Hcnninger and Sharon Nich ols, will perform the trio framed by Coffman's reading of her work ""Brother Ass."" Guest artist Richard Bull will offer his perpetually fresh perspec tive via a fall workshop in perfor mance improvisation sponsored by the Bucknell Association for the Arts. Setting only broad guidelines, Bull utilizes an assortment of Bach fugues to showcase the concentra tion and split-second timing required to spontaneously create new movement ""on the spot"" in ""The Well-Tempered Dancers."" The extremely complex, and perhaps controversial ""MaDonna designers, presents a farcical MTV look at the sexual fantasies sur rounding women. Fast-paced, raunchy, and irreverent, this shocking piece js complete with costumes of cami soles and garter belts. The work features students Tomoaki Osuga '90 and Geofry Glenn '90 as voy eurs, and it promises both theatrical appeal and controversy. The performance will also feature the return of tap dance to Bucknell with sophomore Janelle Oltorik's ""Misbehavin."" The piece is a colorful quartet set to music by Fats Waller. More new student cho- reography includes junior Joni Hong's ""All That Glitters,"" a 1950's style jazz piece about three sexy women competing for atten tion, and senior Jennifer Fcrland's contemporary suite set to music by Enya entitled ""L'Au-dela."" Senior Jason Aten creates both set design and lighting for the latter two pieces. Assistant Professor of Dance, Danna Frangione and Shcllic Cash- Muller will premier two new works. Frangione's ""Castaway"" uses traditional Irish music to paint an expressionistic picture of a par ticular landscape of Northwest Ire land known as the Burren. Remote and stark, this great limestone pla- locals. Designer F. Elaine Wil liams, associate professor of theatre and director of theatre contributes her skill both to costume design for ""Castaway"" and set design for Cash-Mullcr's ""At the Door."" Per formed by senior Tina Hcnninger, the solo work is a clear-eyed, bru tally honest look at unrequited love. The concert also showcases the lighting designs of new Depart ment of Theatre and Dance Light ing Designer/Technical Director Steven Draheim and set and cos tume designs of Director of Theatre F. Elaine Williams. Curtain is at 8 p.m. Photo by Debra Cook Bucknell seniors, (from I to r) Sharon Nichols, Tomoaki Osuga, and Hannah Fuentes will perform ""The MaDonna Reed Show"" in the dance performance next Friday and Saturday nights at 8 p.m."

Dance Com pany has surprises in,
Collins' show charmed audience,"By Lydia Neuman Staff Writer Today's college-age students missed the debut of Judy Collins but grew up in a world of musical waters permanently tinged by the piagic of Collins and her Contemporaries. On Friday, November 16 the Weis Center's stage, bathed in gold light, was graced by a figure in black velvet. With a soon-familiar toss of gray-blond hair, Collins seated herself at the piano and embarked solo, on a journey through ""The Blizzard"", the piece that heads her latest album, Fires of Eden. A four-member orchestra drifted onstage in mid-song and as each roused his or her instrument from sleep into reverberation, new and awesome dimensions spun around the core of a crystalline voice. Embodied at the outset were the elements that characterize Col lins' virtuosity: narrative lyrics, emotional delivery and superb musicianship. ""The Blizzard"" was composed, as noted on her album, ""out of my lifetime love affair with a good story and from my passion for the mountains."" After forgetting the second line of ""Chelsea Morning"" in what Collins winningly termed ""my excitement over that first song,"" she went on to perform other high lights from Fires of Eden in addi tion to her older classics and bor rowings from The Beatles, Joni Mitchell and Linda Griffith. Standouts among her original compositions included an a capella piece accompanied by the poig nantly majestic voices of whales, a recording presented to her as a gift from a friend. Her respect for, and enchantment with, nature were affirmed through innovations like this one and through actions such as donating a portion of Fires of Eden profits to The Garden of Eden Planet Foundation. The Founda tion, co-established by Collins, will use this money to plant seedlings in Colorado. Environmental issues are not the only ones Collins addresses; in accordance with her position as a pacifist, she prefaced several songs with references to the crisis in the Persian Gulf and executed ""Fortune of Soldiers"", whose lyrics insist ""When they said that peace was just a dream... they didn't know about you."" Perhaps this ""you"" is every one of us. After declaring her personal admiration for Bette Midler, ""the woman who taught Cyndi Lauper how to dress,"" Collins explained that soon after recording From A Distance, her producer called and asked, ""Guess who just released that as a single?"" This same sce nario had played itself out earlier when quite coincidentally, Midler beat Collins to the release of 'The Wind Beneath My Wings"". Inspiration came to Collins through songs sung by her father while shaving (She played her favorite among these) and guest musicians on his radio show. In 1968, she decided to attempt song writing on a whim, previously of the conviction that ""there were enough songs around to be sung."" Her piano teacher discouraged her ambitious student from developing a repertoire that incorporated com posers other than Mozart and Bee thoven. Years later, this woman would attend her famous pupils' concerts only to ""clasp my hands, look into my eyes and say wist fully, 'Little Judy, you really could have gone places.'"" Audience-anticipated rendi tions of ""Both Sides Now"" and ""Send In The Clowns"" were worthy of the excitement they induced, although the latter came only after several minutes of imploring applause once Collins had left the stage. The concert concluded after arriving full-circle at a reprise of ""The Blizzard"", an anthem of romance and Rocky Mountain win ter that simultaneously eclipsed and illuminated all the music that lay within its peripheries."

Celebrate the harvest,"By Shirin Kambin Kwanzaa is the only nation- aly recognized cultural holiday which is neither religious, political nor heroic. Translated from Kiswa- hili to mean ""the first fruits of the harvest,"" it is a community cele bration of African-American cul ture. It was founded in 1966 by Dr. Maulana Karenga, a black studies professor who considers himself a cultural nationalist. Kwanzaa is uniquely American and is being celebrated here at Bucknell, where it is sponsored by the African American Cultural society and the Multiculture center. The celebra tion began this past Monday and will continue through the weekend. There are seven principles associated with Kwanzaa, and each of these principles are being cele brated this week. The principles cover unity, both within the family and on a broader scale, self- determination, responsibility, coop erative economics, purpose, crea tivity, and faith. In celebration of Kwanzaa and the principles which it recog nizes there have been a number of events on campus this past week. Karen Bojar, brought to campus with the help of the Pennsylvania Humanities Council, gave a presen tation on Monday about ""The Meaning of Cultural Literacy in a Multiculture Society."" In addi tion,the film, Gotta Make that Journey: Sweet Honey in the Rock was shown on Tuesday. There will also be a number of principle readings each night this weekend. These readings will be done by various students at 7 p.m. in Seventh Street House. All are welcome to attend to learn more about the celebration of Kwanzaa."
"""Grafitti"" says it all",
Prince's new alburn shines strong,"By Matt Wood Let's face it, whether you like Prince or not, he's a rhythm and blues artist of considerable merit Purple Rain and Sign of the Times are two of the finest albums ever produced. It's only too fre quently that you find yourself humming along with songs like ""Raspberry Beret"" and ""Little Red Corvette"" when they come on the radio. Unfortunately, Prince's lat est efforts, ""Batman"" and ""Love- sexy"" were not at all representa tive of his great talent. Devoid of continuity and hits, one might wonder if Prince has in fact lost his rhythm. Much to the delight of many, he has responded with an album that is reminiscent of his previous style and offers some hope that he hasn't lost himself in the confines of Paisley Park after all. The new album, Graffiti Bridge, serves as the soundtrack to the forthcoming movie of the same name. Though the movie itself is supposed to be a sequel to Purple Rain, the album doesn't seem to kindle many of the same vibes as its predecessor. This may be interpreted negatively, but rather it only is meant to stress the unique qualities of Graffiti Bridge. Another noteworthy differ ence between Grafitti Bridge and Purple Rain is that there arc a whopping seventeen songs. At the same time, listeners may be sur prised to find that only about half of these songs are performed by Prince. The others are the prod ucts of Prince's Paisley Park Playmates, Morris Day and the Time, as well as numerous other female vocalists. The Time add a few solid tracks, but their pres ence is generally annoying and distracting. On the other hand, the female artists add hand somely to the quality of the music. The most notable track is one titled ""Round and Round"" by Tevin Campbell; expect to hear more from her. For the most part, Prince's own efforts are quite good. ""Can't Stop,"" ""Elephants and Flowers,"" and, of course, ""Thieves in the Temple"" are all solid bets. ""The Question of U"" and ""Joy In Repetition"" are both excellent slow songs in keeping with past efforts such as ""Purple Rain"" (the song) and ""The Ballad of Dorothy Parker"" ( Sign of the Times). ""New Power Generation"" (Parts I and II) will rock the dance clubs. On the whole, there is plenty of good music to be enjoyed from this album. Though it is just a cut below ""Purple Rain"" and ""Sign of the Times,"" minus the obnoxious Morris Day clan, this is a composition crea tively written and performed. The bottom line: It's worth your investment (preferably CD). Rating: (on scale of 1 to 5) Graffiti Bridge= 3 3/4 stars Oust not quite 4)."

community in confinement,"Dy Rob Schroeder Staff Writer The State Correctional Insti tute for women in nearby Muncy, Pennsylvania, and the Quaker sect of Christianity are two things few Bucknellians think frequently about. Yet independently and together, the prison and the Quak ers are an important part of our small town community here. To many of us, though, a prison is a foreboding and fear-inspiring place; a place we intend to stay out of and away from. Moreover, prob ably very few of us have had the experience of attending a Quaker meeting and know little about their ways. ""What connection do the Quakers and the prison have?"" you might be asking. The connections are faith, a need for and a love of silence, and a community of friends. The Lewisburg Quaker meeting (as well as the Pennsdale and Millville meetings) have devel oped a special relationship with the inmates of the State Correctional Institute at Muncy through the unique Quaker faith. I recently went to the prison to find out why, and how. For the group of approxi mately 20 women at the Quaker meeting I attended, the sense of community and fellowship seemed to be the main attraction to the unu sual sect. The Quakers and their meeting and openness provide an alternative to the inmates' ""deadly routine form of life,"" as Lewisburg meeting member Barry Bishop described it Indeed, upon walking into the prison's chapel, where the meeting was held, I immediately felt like I was among a close knit group. Everyone smiled, and the women were glad to see old friends and a new face. The inmates warmly shook my hand and smiled at me. There was no threat, no intimidation and no fright True to Quaker form, the meeting sat in silence with occasional monologues for one half hour. The other half hour was composed of conversation and catching up with each other. During the total hour, and through previous talks with members of the Lewisburg meeting, I got a good sense of what the two groups meant to each other. every other prisoner's must be withheld.) Hers was not the only reaction against other Christian sects. Another inmate told me that the Quaker meeting's ""atmosphere was much more pleasant,"" and that she could ""worship in [her] own fashion."" Several other women had revolted against their former faiths, *MAXIMUM * .SFCURlTy. --"
JL,"Even though there is ""a lot to choose from in the way of religious expression"" at the prison, the Quak ers were actually asked by the inmates to come and hold meetings. There was nothing at the prison that addressed ""how we [inmates] felt and what we believed; what we were concerned about,"" said the woman who initially confronted the prison Chaplain with her spiritual dilemmas. (Her name as well as particularly the strict Catholic denomination. Though only con fined to the institution's grounds for an hour, it certainly seemed like these women had their share of stringent regulations. Visitors pass through a metal detector after they have had a prior security clearance. Members of religious sects are not allowed to write, call, or visit except at the designated times of worship. They are not even allowed"
Exploring the ghost of Hunt Hall,
Custodians claim to have seen the spirit of a deceased girl who once,
lived in room 346,"By Jen Marshall Staff Writer Ready for a good ghost story? Well, have a seat, turn on a lot of lights, and make sure you're not on the third floor of the south wing of Hunt Hall. Before the real tale is told, the false stories cluttering the sad history of the ghost of Hunt Hall should be made known, and then dismissed forever. A lot of people know bits and pieces of what really happened and then have invented or guessed the rest. Most everyone agrees that a young woman died on a dark, rainy night and that now her ghost haunts a certain hall of Hunt. Not many agree on why she died, or even how she died. Some say that while waiting for her parents to pick her up for break, she fell into the stream that runs alongside Hunt and drowned. Others contend that the accident happened a really long time ago and that she was in a horse and buggy accident. Closer to the actual truth, yet another source believes that a prankster called the young woman home with false news of her brother's death. While the unfortunate girl was returning to Bucknell after dis covering the hoax, she supposedly died in a car accident. None of these versions of the tragedy that took place on that black night are true. The only written material on this subject that I found was a short article written in the 1983 July/ August issue of Bucknell World , the alumni magazine. The article con tained little more than a description of the ghost, and none of the details of that fateful night. Marsha Gori, editor of Bucknell World, knew the real story, though, because that short article had evoked some pain ful memories for one of the dead woman's sorority sisters. This sister wrote Marsha a long, sad, and fact- filled letter about the young woman's death. Marsha Gori would like the names of both the deceased and the letter-writer to remain anon ymous out of respect for their fam ily and friends. Anyway, this is the REAL story of the ghost of Hunt Hall... The rain hadn't stopped once all day, and its depressing clamor continued into the late evening. A young woman let her eyes stray from her textbook and she smiled as she looked at her Greek letters. ""How nice"", she thought, ""it is to be a Kappa Delta"". She stared again at her homework in frustration and wished that it were 1967, because then she would be done with books and graduating from Bucknell. ""But,"" she said fondly to herself, ""I'll miss living on the south wing of Hunt Hall in room 346."" The loud ring of the telephone inter rupted the young woman's wander ing thoughts. She answered the phone, hoping to talk with a friend, but instead learned of yet another tragedy that had befallen her fam ily. Three weeks earlier, her mother had committed suicide, and now someone was calling to tell her that her brother had been found dead on her mother's fresh grave. Grabbing a raincoat and her car keys, the young woman rushed from her dorm to go home for the funeral. All of the sadness and emptiness of the two deaths and funerals had made her very tired, nearly to the point of exhaustion. The young woman managed to stay awake for most of the drive on her return to Bucknell after the funeral, but on route 15, just in front of the hospital, the young woman fell asleep at the wheel and was killed in a car accident. It is said that her ghost in a raincoat haunts the third floor of Hunt in what is now the Beta Gamma suite. She appears every two or three years, according to the article in Bucknell World, and she asks for help. Does anyone still believe in to learn the prisoners' first names. All is strict and impersonal. The Quakers, though, ""have some inter est in who [the prisoners] are... [and] don't try to change them as people."" Since individual enlighten ment and lack of creed are major facets of the Quaker life, their faith is an important alternative to relig ious life at Muncy. Even though every woman at Muncy has been found guilty of a crime by our justice system and is thereby incarcerated, some inmates are not without a sense of freedom. The weekly meeting is a welcome and liberating break from the tough routine of prison life. The freedom is both religious and personal, a chance to rejoice in beliefs and a chance to talk out problems and concerns. One woman spoke in a loud, strong voice during the meet ing, her eyes shut tight: ""He [God] give[s] you peace,"" she said, ""He set[s] you free even though we [are] in prison."" ""I never been so free in my life as when I accepted the Lord into my life,"" she went on to say, ""even though I'm in prison. I wouldn't give the Lord up for nothin' else in the world."" Other members nodded, some lost in her words, some still searching them selves for their own convictions or solutions. Clearly, through the silence of a Quaker meeting, these women and others had found a faith that liberated and accepted rather than controlled and condemned. That, I gathered from looking at some of the hardened faces turned soft, is the connection of the Quak ers and the women at Muncy. That is why the women asked them there and why they keep coming back. As a Lewisburg meeting member told me, they are ""trying to create some sort of community."" And behind the barbed wire fence of the State Correctional Institute at Muncy, a community is indeed what I found."

Dear Wanda,"this ghost? Apparently quite a few people do. The custodians of Hunt Hall, who wish to remain anony mous, claim to have experienced some strange things on the third floor. During the summer, when the custodians thoroughly clean Hunt hall, they are the only people that have access to the building. One custodian swears that on occasional summer mornings as she enters Hunt, she can see the bathroom light on in the third floor. When she goes to the third floor to clean, the light is off. This is a recurring event. Another custodian says that she can sometimes feel the pres ence of someone there and can almost smell a soft perfume. When this has happened, she has been alone. Throughout the many years that the custodians have cared for Hunt, they have heard stories from the residents of the third floor. The sorority sisters have claimed every thing from moved furniture to actu ally seeing the ghost The Kappa Delta sister who was a friend to this unfortunate young woman writes in her letter, ""To all of you who wonder, greet her with love and calm her fears. She always found friends on third Hunt"" This is where the ghost story ends. Or begins, if you choose to believe in the ghost of Hunt Hall Dear Wanda, I can't decide whether to stay at home or come back here for January. Some people have told me that it is a lot of fun but others have said it's boring. There are some Jan Plans that I would be interested in tak- ing...what do you think? Torn Dear Tom, I happen to think that January is the perfect (and possibly ONLY) time to experience college without stress. Taking a Jan Plan that inter ests you leaves plenty of time to do things you don't have time for dur ing the semester. You can actually read a book of your own choosing, learn poker, play in the snow, or party every night. Or not. There are fewer people on campus; enor mous, crowded parties will proba bly be rare. The rule tends to be more casual get-togethers. You may want to try to convince some friends to stay also; they could be completely different people in the absence of stress. If you need to earn money for next semester, there would be ample time to work. Do you think you'll get antsy being on campus when it is uncrowdcd? Jan uary is the perfect time for road- tripping. Check out Rcptiland or Hershey Park. Follow the basket ball team to all of their away games. Your schedule should be much more flexible and relaxed than during the regular school year. Think of it this way - how much fun do you really imagine you'll have at home? Bucknell without classes and pressure is a different experience to say the least. Dear Wanda, I'm a junior and I'm get ting bored with the drinking scene. I feel like all there is to do here is to get drunk. Any suggestions? Teetotler Dear Teetotler, Bucknell advertises many non-drinking activities. Almost every weekend the Weis Center hosts a variety of entertainment - operas, symphonies, and chorale groups are just a few. Many dance shows and plays are performed at Bucknell also. The new Bison is a great opportunity to escape the booze scene. Comedians, musi cians, and movies are among the upcoming activities planned. There is also nothing wrong with inviting a group of friends over to listen to your favorite tunes and chat with each other. If you have some money and transportation, you can go dancing, miniature golfing, bowling, mall-hopping, or road- tripping to visit friends at other col leges. Sometimes getting away from the Bucknell Bubble will help. The choice to drink is yours alone - it is up to you to seek out other ways to spend your time that will make you happy. Good luck!

Located on Route 61 in Paxinos, Ghezzi's offers an excellent dining atmosphere, great food and personalized service. Julie and Steve, in search of the dining shangri la, took the plunge and drove the scenic twenty-minutes to Ghezzi's. Situated amid a tall stand of pine, the restaurant looks somewhat unimpressive from the outside -- gravel parking lot, modest painted sign and sim ple building. (No glaring beacon, like we found at Perkin's; then again, Ghezzi's is no franchise.) Upon entering, the restauranteur recognizes Ghezzi's for what it is reputed to be -- a cozy restaurant offering a surprisingly wide selection of dishes, all at relatively reasonable prices. Julie sampled the Chicken Cacciatorc ($10.95), which she found to be juicy and moist. Each entree, incidentally, comes with a salad and serving of Ghezzi's famous garlic bread -- both of which Julie found to be quite tasty. Steve tried the Shrimp Katie ($14.50). The shrimp, served in a cream sauce on a bed of linguine, was plentiful and delicious. Steve munched quite heavily on the garlic bread, finding it very good, and enjoyed his salad as well. One final tipster on Ghezzi's -- don't bother taking your American Express, Visa or Master Card. None are accepted. You can pay with cash, check or be billed. Julie and Steve highly recommend Ghezzi's, and have awarded it the coveted four and one-half bison. Make sure to get reservations, then check it out!"

A look at Bucknell's,
underground world,"By Sean Grass Staff Writer The old wooden door on Lower Level One of Ellen Clarke Bertrand Library slid bpen noise lessly to reveal the shadowed room beyond. The room was walled by smooth concrete that was inter rupted only by the network of pipes and gratings that ran across the floor. On the opposite wall stood a chain-link gate that barred the way to a small and lightlcss tunnel. Our guide, Michael Noll, the Manager of Energy and Utili ties at Bucknell, brandished his flashlight at the dark passage and called to the photographer Colin Bridgewater and me to follow him to the gate. No, this is not a new edition of Bison Tales. This is a true story about Bucknell University and the secrets that lie beneath it. I took a deep breath as Colin checked his camera for the last time before we entered the mysteri ous labyrinth. I reviewed what Mr. Noll had already told me about the tunnels. In a brief discussion in his office at the Physical Plant, Mr. Noll offered a bit of background information. The original tunnel was constructed from Bertrand Library in 1950 and ended just ten yards short of the Carnegie Build ing. In 1971, however, a new por tion of the tunnel connected this previous dead end to the Langone Center. Even more recently, con struction was completed on an addition to the tunnel that con nected Bertrand with the Weis Center. The original tunnel is much narrower and more difficult to navigate than the later additions. Noll explained that the pur pose behind this tunnel system is the housing of the trunklines of Buckncll's heating and electrical systems. Said Noll, ""We're run ning steam, we're running volt age-- 12,000 or 2400 volts, as the case may be--and phone wiring."" Having the major arteries for these systems housed in the tunnels reduces the rate of deterioration for the pipes and wires as opposed to what that rate would be if the pipes and wires were merely buried in the ground. Smaller branchings of pipes do, however, diverge from these main arteries and run under ground to their final destinations. Colin finished the adjust ments to his camera, and it was finally time to enter the mysterious Bucknell tunnels. Noll unlocked the chain-link gate and led us for ward into the darkness. After a few steps he stopped and began feeling along the wall. He found the switch he was looking for and the lights came on, one light bulb after another along the ceiling of the"

Also spaced at intervals are the detectors that are the underground security system. This security system was put into place a few years back to put a stop to a string of thefts in the Langone Center. Students were breaking into the tunnels at the library and finding their way down to the L. C. where they would steal food from the dining service, Noll explained. ""Many a student, "" Noll said, ""has broken in and run back and forth in the tunnels."" Noll jokingly referred to this as ""tunnel mad ness"", but on the serious side he section of the tunnels, but, even so, the tunnels arc remarkably neat and clean. The pipes and walls arc smooth. Noll stopped us to point out some graffiti that was left by a previous daring expedition into the tunnels. The spray-painted words announced that Todd, Sue, Pat, and R.J. were there in *88. Several areas have such writing, Noll said, although the incidence of people breaking into the tunnels has decreased over the past few years. We proceeded down the tun nel all the way to the Carnegie Building, but we elected to go back and explore the other direction toward the Weis Center rather than continuing to the L. C. By this time I was viewing rather dubiously Mr. action I had been looking for. In fact, though the tunnels were fascinating in their technical and engineering merit, they held lit tle in the way of intrigue. The newer tunnels were even cleaner and more orderly than the original, and I never did see the rats that Mr. Noll spoke of. Other than the fact that the tunnels were rather warm from the heat of the huge steam pipes, I found them to be quite comfortable and not at all mysterious. Mr. Noll led Colin and me back to Bertrand Library, conclud ing our tour of Buckncll's under ground secrets.

The sides and ceiling are lined with a variety of pipes, valves and clamps, many of which must be ducked under or inched around. In the dark I easily would have cracked my skull on a low-hanging pipe. As we climbed around a protruding valve handle, Noll informed us, ""We would already've been detected, "" in reference to the security system. Wide but shallow puddles of water mark the floor in this older << s * ?tes.. ture in the tunnels yet. I thought we'd finally found some mystery when Mr. Noll abruptly halted our passage to the Weis Center. He pointed to a metal ladder that extended up through the ceiling of the tunnel and ended at a metal trapdoor. ""Go ahead and open it...really scare someone, "" he said. Colin climbed the ladder and peeked his head out of the trapdoor to find that he was in the parking lot outside of Swartz Hall. While he didn't scare anyone, Colin did admit to receiving an odd look from a woman walking at the other end of the lot. It wasn't quite the repairs down there difficult, it would certainly ""liven up"" any future tours given for Bucknellian reporters. Also, I have to believe that it would greatly enhance the effectiveness of the security system. All in all, the underground tunnels that wind their way under the campus arc not the mystery they have been cracked up to be. The tunnels merely serve their pur pose-supplying heat and electric ity. Of course, other myster ies... real mysteries....are sure to exist somewhere. I guess we'll just have to keep looking."

EDITORIAL STAFF,
PRODUCTION & OPERATIONS,"The United States and Republic of Iraq are on the brink of war, it's high time students here at Bucknell realize how much our small college community could be affected by it. With the passage of a United Nations Security Council resolution permitting the use of force to dislodge Iraqi forces from Kuwait, the United States is poised to launch an offensive strike -- one that could cost up to 30,000 casualties in the first week, thus necessitating the reinstatement of a nation-wide draft. Such a move could mean that your fellow Bucknellians, men 18 years of age and older, would be standing amid the dunes of Saudi Arabia, draped in chemical warfare gear, in a matter of months. Hearings held by the Senate Armed Services Committee yesterday indicate that this scenario is becoming increasingly probable -- many officials in the Defense Department believe adamantly that a reinstatement of the draft is necessary. The numbers of troops necessary for real military action, with real casualties, far exceed the numbers presently in our all-volunteer military. The Defense Department higher-ups believe this draft is neces sary now , and with predictions that the war would continue into this summer, draftees would most likely see the harsh, sandy beaches of the Middle East. This reality is even more piercing when one accepts that the bulk of the forces in the Gulf will be American forces. That will make the draft -- and Bucknellians' chances of meeting some Iraqis -- even more real. S.T.O.P. (Students and Teachers Organizing for Peace) and various academic departments have been attempting to inform the community of the implications of the conflict in the Gulf, with only marginal success. It seems once again that the ""Bucknell Bubble"" is distorting our abilities to understand and accept the reality of events that have not yet begun to directly affect us. While you need not agree with these groups' stances or their methods of informing, you should arm yourselves with the knowledge necessary to make your own, informed decisions. Make yourselves aware of the issues and what is at stake, for you may be the next to hit the sands of Saudi Arabia.

Junior abroad,
criticizes riot,"To The Editor: As I write this, I am one month and 4,000 miles away from the ""Halloween riot."" Thank God. I can't tell you how proud I was to be a Bucknellian as I read the accounts of October 31,1990. My chest swelled with pride as I ima gined the scene--Scott Macfee in a police car surrounded by 500 drunken kids singing ""Give Peace a Chance!"" (Somewhere John Lennon is rolling over in his grave. I'm sure he wrote the song for just such occasions--better a bunch of spoiled-rotten drunken kids protesting for beer than Viet nam war protesters taking up the tune.) As I read the articles, I kept hoping I'd get to the end and read the whole thing was a silly ""War of the Worlds""-type Halloween prank, and that everyone on cam pus was still sane. Yet, that never happened. It was all horribly real. I don't know how anyone there could have complained that his or her constitutional rights were being infringed upon! Last time I checked, it was not at all illegal for police officers to investi gate a situation where there was probable cause that the laws of the state were being broken. Maybe 400 kids in a couple of houses playing loud music is not probable cause, but I would tend to disagree. Evidently disturbing the peace to the extent that the police were forced to respond to neighbors' complaints is no longer illegal either. The tensions on campus, no matter how we students try to fool ourselves into thinking they rise from a noble cause, rise from the fact that most of our students can think of nothing better to do with themselves in 48 hours where noth ing is planned for them than ille gally drinking alcohol. If we can think of nothing better to do than break the laws of the state know ingly, we deserve strict enforce ment by those in positions of authority. Perhaps the funniest mental picture was of the administration telling 100 drunken students, things will get better, they need See RIOT, page 9"
Reporting of drunken behavior questioned,
Protection of identity is necessary in Bucknell's small community,"To the Editor: In reading The Bucknellian for the past three years, I can say that, for the most part, the writers and editors have been responsible journalists and have covered fairly interesting topics despite our some what static environment here at Bucknell. I am sure at times it is quite challenging to find eye catching front page stories week after week when the most contro versial issue on campus is sidewalk chalk writing. I must say, however, that in your recent publication you blatantly crossed the line of respon sible journalism in your coverage of the Curran McCann incident. We arc students in a small community of about 3,500 people who know each other and interact with one another on a daily basis, and many of us come to a small lib eral arts school because of that tight feeling of community. The drawback in this, of course, is the lack of privacy and anonymity that we all value at times but for the most part deal without on this cam pus. When someone disturbs our static lives, we have, what your publication would consider, front page news. Last week's incident may be news, but without question other stories that were covered in the same issue warranted more atten tion than a drunk student who lost control in the freshman dorms. He got drunk and violent and now he will be punished. Surely his deal ings with the situation have been a challenge, and the consequences of this incident will lead to some frus trating and trying times ahead. He may, in fact, be upset or embar rassed about what happened, or per haps this incident has brought on other problems that you or I have no hint of. But, of course, you may not have considered the complexities of the situation--that he is one of a couple thousand students on this campus--and now everyone, pro fessors, friends, and administrators alike, know that Curran McCann called a security officer a f--irjg pig. How necessary is every abbre viated vulgarity? I cannot help but think that your readers would have been able to visualize the scene had you not spelled out every vio lent act that he may have committed. This incident could have been summarized in one paragraph in the security log. But instead you resorted to some perverse style of yellow journalism that made your front page look foolish. Perhaps you might keep in mind from now on that each of us here represents; fairly significant percentage of thi college community, and what might be interesting news to tab loid papers might be a sensitive topic to an individual on a campus of 3,500 students. If this means another front page headline that reads Chalk Talk Controversy Continues , then that is what we shall read--but at least your publi cation will have some,tact.

Professor offers ranking analysis,
Librarian expresses concern,"To the Editor: Many students and the library staff share concern about excessive noise in the library. Fra- most people a ""party"" atmosphere makes it impossible for serious study to take place. No librarian or library staff mem ber wants to monitor behavior. We are in the library to help you, to find needed information and to assist your study. We need the cooperation of all library users to maintain a library environment conducive to study. All it takes is two or more library users to start the din. Hints for Library Use: * speak in a whisper * use group studies for group discussions * use vending lounge for refreshments * respect the rights of others for undisturbed study space * respect the needs of others for a quiet, calm, clean study environment. The library is apublic place for private work. You deserve a quiet library--you can make a difference. JoAnne Young Associate Director of Library and Instructional Media Services j November 12,1990 To the Editor: I am using the data from the U.S. News & World Report, Octo ber 15,1990, as an example of mul tiple regression analysis for a course in statistics. Below are some findings that may be of interest. It is an analysis of the 133 National Liberal-Arts Colleges for whom complete, comparable data is included in the report so that ranks could be generated. (For the statis tics aficionado, R 2 = .88 for the ""Overall Scores"" of the top 25 col leges.) Colleges were stratified by programs in which there are at least 2 majors according to the Compara tive Guide to American Colleges (1987). * Accounting: Bucknell ranks #"
2,. * Business Administration and Management/General: Bucknell ranks #3. * Computer Science: Bucknell ranks #5. * Elementary Education: Bucknell ranks #1. * Engineering: Bucknell ranks #
2,". Of the colleges that offer all five programs, Bucknell is #1 in the nation by far. This is a rather immodest analysis in a numbers game which may be played in a number of ways. But when our community is continually confronting local varia tions on universal problems, it may be helpful to remind ourselves of what Bucknell is.

US presence vital,
in Persian Gulf,"By Tom Travis There are growing signs that war may soon occur in the Persian Gulf, as early as late January or February. As the prospect for war nears, the debate over the desira bility of military action has inten sified in the United States. The issues are highly complex and there is no easy answer to what the United States should do. This essay will argue that nonviolent means to dislodge Iraq from Kuwait should be given many more months to work, but that if they should fail, then a U.N. spon sored war with a prominent U.S role should be waged to reverse Iraq's aggression. The argument rests on a cen tral premise: Interstate war should be waged only if it is just The realist tradition in international relations states that in the anar chic, competitive world system, countries must be concerned with their national interest and practice !self-help by accumulating power and, when necessary, by waging war regardless of morality. This position is wrong. States must not be permitted to wage war by whim, often based on inflated, self-serving definitions of national interest. State behavior, instead, should be bound by moral restraints. A key moral principle, should be the sanctity of life. Only the most extreme circumstances should justify the use of violence to take a human life. What are the conditions that would morally justify the killing of humans through warfare? The main condition is that of self- defense. If a person's life is imme diately threatened by an aggressor and the victim is unable to escape or peacefully deflect the blow, then he or she should have the moral right to practice self- defense, including slaying the per petrator, if necessary. By acting to murder the victim, the aggressor loses his or her right to live and can justifiably be killed. By anal ogy, a state that is victimized by unprovoked aggression should have the right to practice violent self-defense, including taking the lives of the armed personnel that have invaded it. This view on justifiable self- defense assumes the inviolability of state sovereignty. State sove reignty, the right of a government to rule its citizens within interna tionally recognized boundaries free from external interference, has long been enshrined in interna tional law. A country may choose to eliminate its sovereignty volun tarily, such as by unification with another state, but sovereignty should never be involuntarily removed by war. With great caution, the notion of self-defense could be stretched beyond resisting a direct invasion. A government should have the right to defend itself against unprovoked, unilateral, external sanctions that jeopardize the basic economic or physical health of its citizens. For example, if one state should deprive another of an essential resource or should initiate a strangling blockade, and the victim has no peaceful recourse, then it should have the right to use military force to pro tect its core interests. Often, the victims of aggres sion lack the capability to defend themselves. These victims deserve to be defended and to have their sovereignty preserved. Indeed, governments and their citizens should think of themselves as part of an interconnected human com munity and world society where members not only have a moral obligation to forgo aggression, but also to collaborate militarily to aid victims of aggression who are unable to help themselves. In sum, the only morally permissable use of war is for self- defense against unprovoked inva sion or crippling unilateral coer cion and to defend the victims of such actions. All other forms of interstate war--aggressive, pre emptive, imperial, and interven tionist are wrong. On these grounds, most of the wars fought since 1945, including nearly every war fought by the United States and Soviet Union, have been morally wrong. With one excep tion, the superpowers have waged interventionist wars designed to sustain or change a particular gov ernment. While interventionist wars arc unnacceptable, they arc not as bad as wars of imperial aggression which snuff out a country's very sovereign existence. It was clearly wrong of Iraq to invade Kuwait. Kuwait might have antagonized Iraq by refusing to cede islands in the Persian Gulf to Baghdad, by stealing oil from the Rumaila oilfield, by cheating on OPEC price policies, and by insisting on Iraqi repayment of loans provided to help Baghdad fight Iran. Yet, none of these actions threatened any vital Iraqi interests or were provocative enough to justify Baghdad's attack. Iraq should not be allowed to get away with its flagrant viola tion of international law and Kuwait deserves to have its sove reignty restored. It should be noted that Iraq has no right to use force to end the U.N. embargo, which admittedly harms its vital interests. The reason is that Iraq provoked the embargo which was introduced only to compel Bagh dad to respect international law. The United States, along with other members of the global community, has an obligation to make Iraq withdraw from Kuwait, using force to accomplish this if necessary. The U.S. right to use force, however, should not rest on considerations of narrow national interest. Iraq has done nothing in the Persian Gulf to threaten vital American interests.

Student encourages support of troops,"From page 8 time. All of sudden President Sojka is President Gorbachev trying to hold his society together before it destroys itself. Somehow the rheto ric seems so ridiculous--has the entire Bucknell community lost sight of what's really important in this world? Perhaps the only posi tive thing to come of the whole shameful episode was that ""chalk writing"" faded from the front pages for a while. It's funny to look at my school from so far away. My friends at other schools, despite my protests, always insisted on telling me that Bucknellians were spoiled rich kids who could afford to spend four years totally wrapped up in themselves, nothing more than alcoholics in training. I told them it wasn't so. Now this. For the first time in my college career, I was embarrassed to be a Bucknellian.

When I first heard of Students and Teachers Orga nized for Peace, I was anxious to get involved. I do, after all, want peace. Who doesn't? I was asked to wear a yellow ribbon to sup port our troops involved in Oper ation Desert Shield. I gladly did. In fact, I have had a big yellow ribbon in my window for most of the semester to show my support. Then on November 15,1 attended my first, and last, S.T.O.P. meeting. It was then that I discovered I was not sup porting the troops by wearing the yellow ribbon, rather voicing ""disagreement with U.S. policy in the Gulf."" This was a distortion of the traditional use of the yellow ribbon and I was irate at the way S.T.O.P. was mixing its words and intentions. When I voiced my thoughts at the meeting, I said I was very concerned with a peaceful resolution to the situa tion in the Gulf, but did not nec- To the Editor: Walking downhill toward the UC (Pardon me, the ELC), I could not help but notice the creative, overly dramatic display erected by the members of S.T.O.P. Yes, there they were, fifty-four little black tombstones, one for each lost American life, arranged in front of a banner upon which was embla zoned an oil cannister, spilling its bloody contents which, I assume, was intended to inspire anger and heart-felt emotion among the Buck nell population. As I gazed upon this little cemetery, so painstak ingly created for our benefit, I could not help but chuckle to myself. Now I do not question S.T.O.P.'s sincerity, nor do I doubt their dedication to their cause. For example, letters such as Sarah Pryor's, ones wrought with great passion and emotion, do indicate honest (although quite misguided) feelings. We are asked, ""Did you think it was a joke,"" ""Did you feel horror,"" ""Do you know how many United States' troops are in the Per sian Gulf now,"" ""Are you prepared to lose your own life?"" I answered these questions to myself, and after reading the statements made by Sarah Pryor and Mark Larson, I have my own question to ask: ""Do you have any idea what the hell you're talking about?"" Normally I am one to keep my opinions to myself. However, on this subject I cannot remain silent. For those of you who were swayed by S.T.O.P.'s melodra matic babblings in the last edition of The Bucknellian, here are some things to think about: First, as Ms. Pryor so elo quently pointed out, the fifty-four deaths that have occurred were due to accidents. Contrary to popular belief, accidents do not just happen when the United States builds up its military forces in another country. It is a fact that many American sol diers lose their lives due to acci dents that occur during basic train ing and routine military exercises. In fact, this occurs weekly, and mostly on American soil. Why don't we hear about this more often you may ask? Simple, because it doesn't make good journalism. A soldier who is killed in a jeep acci dent in Norman, Oklahoma will not make the front page of any newspa per in America. However, transfer that same incident to the Persian Gulf, and you have a tragic, sense- essarily fee! that the troops should be brought home now, as they suggested. I was told that if I don't agree that the troops should be pulled out now, then ""S.T.O.P. isn't the organization for me and perhaps I should start my own group."" My grievances with S.T.O.P. were only beginning. Perhaps you saw the fifty-four mock graves before Thanksgiv ing? Well, not only did I find it distasteful, but it was inaccurate. Ms. Pryor asked in her letter, 'Did you know that fifty-four people really died?' Where does S.T.O.P. get their facts? I picked up the phone today and called the Department of Defense to get an accurate count. The number of the U.S. casualties thus far in the Gulf is 49. (Which, incidentally, is also the number reported by the press.) Granted it is terrible that these people have died; it is not safe to assume (as Ms. Pryor did in her letter) that these soldiers would still be alive if they were in the United States. As unfortu nate as it is, casualties happen in military training in the United States. I realize that every day my less death. I don't like to hear of anyone being hurt or killed, but you have to realize that unfortu nate accidents do happen, and they can happen anywhere. Second, we are there for a legitimate reason. I will be the first to admit that the world depends too heavily upon oil for survival. I sincerely hope that one day in the near future we can find new sources of energy, ones that will save both our environ ment, and our lives. However, reality tells us that oil is the world's life blood. Whether you like it or not, oil is a vital sub stance which affects every aspect of society; politically, economi cally, and socially. Some people actually say, ""Who needs oil? I could do without it."" Could you really? Could you do without your car, your major appliances, your heating system, your air- conditioning? It takes oil to either run these items or to pro duce them. Now granted, the world would not come to a screeching halt if Hussein cut off the world's oil supply (which he has proposed to do), but we would most definitely feel the detrimental effects of such an action. The world depends upon oil for survival, and we have every right to defend this resource. Third, sanctions do not and will not work. Although Arab culture is rich in tradition, cul ture, and religious fortitude, it is also tribal, fanatical, and antago nistic. It would be swell if U.S. officials could sit down with Hussein, point out the error of his ways, and have him say, ""Golly, I guess I was wrong."" Unfortunately, this could never happen. Arabs are extremely ter ritorial, and if an area of land is claimed in the name of God or some other holy conquest, the victors will defend that land to the death. Saddam Hussein has deeply entrenched his forces in Kuwait, and shows little sign of relenting. We were asked by Saudi Arabia to defend their nation from an attack that could have in all likelihood occurred. What was it that deterred them? It was not words, and nor was it economic sanctions either. It was a show of force, a language that a barbarian like Hussein under stands. A man who invades and destroys a peaceful country, not to mention tortures and kills his brother gets into his Air Force plane, he could have an accident. I also realize that my sisters, parents, friends, etc., could be in an acci dent at any time. These arc not kill ings due to location, as S.T.O.P. would have you believe, but acci dents that could occur anywhere, to anyone. Maybe military personnel are more at risk because of their jobs, but they do have to do the job they were sworn to do--support the policies of the United States Government. S.T.O.P. urged us all to edu cate ourselves about the conflict, and yet they are so concerned with being heard and getting attention, that they have missed some major points. First of all, we are not 'going to war for oil.' Saddam Hussein is threatening to control and manipulate world economy. Secondly, we can not send the mes sage to any would-be invaders of other countries that aggression pays in these Post Cold War times. And finally, let us not forget the Ameri cans who are being held as hos tages. Hussein is inhumanely using them as shields and they have the right to be protected by the U.S. I urge S.T.O.P. to not be so adamant in believing that pulling own people, is not going to give into sanctions and verbal rebukes. I'm sorry, but it just won't happen. (Regarding the effect of sanctions, we may look to South Africa as an example of their failure. The United States and other nations around the world have been imposing economic sanctions against that nation for years. Some might say that Nelson Mandela's release was a direct result of those actions. However, what major changes have there been? The answer...none.) I would like to leave you with this final note. A very close and dear friend of mine is cur rently stationed in the Persian Gulf. I received a letter from him not more than two weeks ago. I would like to quote a few lines from his letter: ""It scares the hell out of me sometimes being here. There are some times when I wish I were home with you guys, just hanging To the Editor: This Thursday, November 29,1990, the United Nations Security Council will vote on a resolution that allows the use of military force in the Persian Gulf. It seems pretty likely that the Security Council will vote in favor of this resolution, but I won der if anyone will question why so many countries had suddenly changed their mind. For example, Colombia has, in the past, very firmly stated that they would not support any use of force and yes terday in the New York Times, they were listed as supporting the resolution. Over the week of Thanksgiving, Bush made a whirlwind trip to countries on the Security Council. I think students need to question what happened behind closed doors, what kind of coercion Bush used. Do not allow the American government to con vince you that this is a United Nations agreement. It is President Bush's resolution, achieved through coercion and forceful persuasion. Another point to consider is if the resolution is passed, it will not be a United Nations force in the Gulf; it will be an American our troops out of the Gulf and rely ing only on negotiations with Iraq is the answer. How does one nego tiate with a liar? I simply ask that the group, whose name implies that all who strive for peace are wel come, realize that not all who desire peace agree on the means of achieving it. One final grievance with S.T.O.P. is that I noticed they have had a letter writing drive to mem bers of the U.N., Congress, and the White House, but neglected to write to the troops. I agree with Ms. Oltorik's letter and her statement that the soldiers need to know we are behind them. My brother was the first U.S. Air Force officer in Saudi Arabia. He writes home often and encourages everyone to write to the soldiers involved in Opera tion Desert Shield. He says mail is a great morale booster, and even though they are all bored and lonely and anxious to come home, they are in the Gulf to do a job and don't want to leave until it's done.

P.'s ideas,"out and having fun. But I know that I'm here for a reason. This isn't another Vietnam like I've heard some people say. It's not just our asses here, it's the whole world's too. People are depending on us to make sure Hussein doesn't pull any more s--t over here and that makes me feel pretty good. In a weird way I'm kind of glad I'm here. I hope we all get to come home soon, but I'll stay as long as I have to. Hope you guys are pulling for me and the other guys over here. We need to be here..."" I hope that all of our troops do come home soon, but in the meantime, let us give them the sup port that they need. My friend has faced reality, and it is about time that some others did as well.

We are the generation that will make the sacrifices that Bush is calling for. Are you prepared for that? Do you want to see the people closest to you die for a cause that our government can not even agree on? This issue of force is an American one. Other countries in the world do not want to use force. They want to allow time for the sanctions to work. They want to encourage negotiations. Of course, these things take time, but can't we take a little time to save thousands of lives? The point of this letter is to make you aware that passing the resolution in the United Nations does not suddenly make force right. No lives should be lost until every possible means of peaceful, non military solutions have been tried. In peace, Nicole Markley '92 and the members of S.T.O.P. November 28,1990"

US gov't strives for preservation of world order,"anyone else. For the first time since 1950, the United Nations has an opportunity to play the security role envisioned by its founders, one that would be condu cive to a more peaceful world order. The U.N. Charter stipulates that individual states should not decide on their own when to wage war, but that only the Security Council, representing the world community through a majority vote, should make this decision. The only exception is that states under direct attack may militar ily defend themselves, with the armed support of their allies, until the Security Council mobilizes a collective security force to wage war on their behalf. The bipolar conflict, resulting in frequent vetoes by the superpow ers, prevented the Security Council from acting effec tively for nearly forty years. With the end of bipola- -- rity, the"

Iraq has not sought to close the Persian Gulf to international shipping. The Iraqi dictatorship is unpleasant, but its human rights violations are no greater than those of some govern ments Washington has long supported. Any American military response, instead, should rest on higher principles of world justice and order. This year is a propitious time to launch a new, pro gressive world order based on the twin principles of full respect for sovereignty and for the inadmissability of war (this new order should also rest on principles of economic distribu- - ...... . ............. tive justice and ecological sustaina bility, but these cannot be addressed here). The bipolar world, -- a major source of past conflict, has collapsed and promises to be replaced by unprecedented cooperation between the two superpowers. The Soviet Union has ended its empire in Eastern Europe, restoring the autonomy of the Eastern European states, and has demonstrated its commitment to curbing warfare by removing its troops from Afghanistan and by convinc ing Vietnam and Cuba to exit from Cambodia and Angola, respectively. The U.S. invasion of Panama, frankly, inhibited the progress toward a more peaceful world. It is important for the United States to reorient its traditional foreign policy, defining its interests in ways more compatible with global needs and acting collectively rather than unilaterally to confront world problems. In this context, the United States would not be justified in initiating war against Iraq at Washington's discretion and at a time and under terms of its own choosing. Any resort to war, including defending a victim of aggression, must be subject to a set of restraining conditions. No military action that violates these conditions can be considered just. The principle of respect for the sanctity of life requires that peaceful measures should be exhausted to convince Iraq to withdraw before force can justifiably be employed. Two peaceful methods are being pur sued in the Persian Gulf conflict: an economic embargo and diplomatic communications. An economic embargo takes time to work-- certainly more than a few months. The embargo has already cut off nearly all of Iraq's foreign trade and financial transactions and has caused shortages of important foodstuffs and of spare parts for its military machine. Military intelligence officials have predicted that with each additional month of the embargo, Iraq's military strength will decline. The embargo should be given sufficient time to have effect, at least a year. If the embargo should finally compell Iraq to withdraw, thereby avoiding further bloodshed, this would be morally preferable to war. It might be countered that the embargo cannot be allowed to last this long, because the aggression and its dire effects must be halted quickly. However, Iraq's actual invasion lasted only a few days. Iraqi looting of Kuwait and killing of its citizens has largely ceased. Since it is not impera tive to end any ongoing atrocities, there is time to con tinue the embargo to determine whether it can succeed. Diplomacy must also be given a chance. So far, the various diplomatic initiatives have failed due to the mutually exclusive demands of Iraq and its rivals. Sad dam Hussein has insisted that any withdrawal must be linked to and come after a multilateral conference which discusses all the key problems in the Middle East. His rivals have opposed such a linkage, believing this would reward Iraq's aggression. They have demanded that Iraq first withdraw from Kuwait, after which some kind of negotiations might be possible. If these positions should remain firm, a negotiated solu tion will be impossible. The coalition's stance raises a question of moral balance. Should sup port of the principle of not rewarding aggression exceed the principle of avoiding the loss of human lives? Are tens of thousands of 111 deaths worth upholding an intangible principle of honor? The answer should be no. The United States should be willing to swallow its pride and to alter its negotiating position, offering Hussein the prospect of a face-saving withdrawal. At the very least, the coali tion could pledge future negotiations on the issues specified by Iraq in exchange for an immediate Iraqi pull-out. Perhaps, a deal could arranged whereby Iraq would withdraw from most of Kuwait on the day the conference began and from the remainder some months later. Promising to hold negotiations would not commit the coalition parties to any particular out come. Indeed, the negotiations could be allowed to fail. However, the embargo and diplomatic efforts cannot be allowed to last endlessly. There must be a time limit, probably no more than a year, by which these initiatives either must have succeeded or be declared a failure. It would be naive not to think that failure is a real possibility. If these peaceful options should fail, then the military alternative should be pursued, but only if a set of further conditions are met. Any military action should be authorized by the U.N. Security Council and not be pursued unilaterally by the United States or Security Coun cil can now ful fill its original prPS0omisc. It is important that the United States adjust its foreign policy to support this new United Nations role. It would be preferable for burden sharing among the allies to be a bit less unequal. If war in the new world order is to reflect the general interest, then states should fulfill the collective obligation to contribute generously to the allied force. The predominant U.S. role, however, docs reflect military reality. The core military powers arc supposed to assume the major mil itary responsibility for maintaining world order, although in a new world system, they would act as the servants of the United Nations. Military effectiveness would be enhanced by having one country supply the bulk of the forces and assume the main command. The United States should not participate in a Persian Gulf war, however, without a declaration of war by Congress. The situation is not a crisis, requir ing a quick Presidential decision without time for Con gressional approval. The Consitution is unmistakably clear that Congress should declare war before the pres ident sends troops into combat. If President Bush should act without Congressional authorization, then he would be guilty of violating democratic principles and the law of the land, which arc impeachable offenses. If the United Nations and the U.S. Congress should approve the use of force, war still should not be initialed prior to the issuance of an ultimatum. It is possible that Saddam Hussein will be ready to submit, once he becomes convinced that a war is really immi nent. An ultimatum would probe this possibility by demonstrating the coalition's resolve. The U.N. reso lution currently being prepared will include an ultimatum. If the Iraqi government should reject the ultima tum, then the decision to use force should rest finally on whether the benefits will exceed the costs. Compet ing moral principles must be weighed against one another here. On the one hand, Kuwaiti sovereignty should be restored and naked aggression should be reversed. On the other hand, the sanctity of human life should be respected and bloodshed should be minimized. Two thorny problems arise here. One is where to draw the line between acceptable and unacceptable costs. Would ten thousand, fifty thousand, or a hun dred thousand deaths be too great to accept? Would the wreckage of the Iraqi economy, causing great human suffering, or the destruction of the Middle East's oil facilities be an excessive price to pay? The estimation of costs will depend on the accuracy of intelligence about the consequences of warfare. The problem is that intelligence predictions may err, as they sometimes have in the past. While prediction can be difficult, it has to be done. Most intelligence estimates suggest that superior western military technology, especially air and naval power, will enable a fairly quick victory, probably within a month. Battlefield casualties would not be low, amounting to as many as thirty thousand dead and wounded among the allied forces and many more among the Iraqis. But, this war would not become a quagmire like Vietnam; indeed, an analogy to Vietnam is inap- - propriate here. This would not be a guerrilla war fought in dense jun gles where western technology and strategy have proven ineffective. Instead, this would be a war on open spaces, where the coalition's superior air, naval and tank power would be potent and where sophisti cated western strategy should prove effective. If a quick military victory can be achieved, the casualties should be limited enough to justify the use of war, because the gains would surpass the costs. The benefits would be numerous. The Iraqi aggression would be reversed and Kuwaiti sovereignty restored. The international law of sovereignty and nonaggres sion would be reinforced. Future aggression would be deterred, as states recognize that such actions could make them subject to a similar U.N. response. It must be remembered that Iraq practices a highly ambitious, revolutionary, jingoistic foreign pol icy. Baghdad has already invaded two states, Iran and Kuwait, in the last eleven years. It is responsible for more than one million deaths in the war against Iran. Iraq may well have aggressive designs on Syria, Saudi-Arabia, several Gulf emirates, and Israel. Fight ing Iraq now may prevent numerous future wars and the casualties of a war next year would be far lower than those in future wars waged with ever more"

A beneficial side effect of war could be the destruction of much of Iraq's military capability which could diminish Iraq's ability to fight in forthcoming years. A successful conclusion to the war would pro mote a more peaceful world order, manifested by greater respect for the international law of war and a strengthened United Nations system with a Security Council capable of deterring war and enforcing interna tional law through the threat of collective security. The new authority of the United Nations in the security area could strengthen its role in economic and ecological dimensions, conducive to a more secure and fair world. The collective war effort would foster improved coop eration between the United States and Soviet Union and between northern and southern states which could help to avert future warfare. The precedents established against aggressive war and unilateral military action and in favor of Security Council authorization of mili tary force could reshape the attitudes of the superpow ers and help to curb or eliminate their future unilateral resort to force. A number of economic benefits would accrue. The restoration of Kuwaiti sovereignty and prevention of future Iraqi conquests would keep the control over petroleum resources dispersed, which, in turn, should help to keep oil prices low. Furthermore, Kuwait and Saudi-Arabia, the two prime targets of Iraqi aggression, have played the leading role in curtailing the oil price rise. Low prices may reinforce the consumptive craze, heighten environmental pollution and obstruct progress toward renewable energy. Yet, it must be remembered that high oil prices are devastating to third world coun tries and seriously impede their development. Further more, as peace returns to the Gulf, the millions of third world workers who were so quickly impoverished as they fled the area, can return. The costs of a war must not be ignored. There will be a sizeable loss of life. If a war were to be pro longed, encompass the whole region, produce severe bloodshed, and cause grave economic destruction, or, if it were to become stalemated and prove unable to restore Kuwaiti _ _ ^ _ sovereignty, then the war should not be fought. It would be a lesser evil to permit the aggres sion to stand, inas- _____ much as the invasion and resultant occupation have caused only a few thousand deaths and the destruction has been confined to the small area of Kuwait. How ever, as argued above, the military costs of the war are not likely to be very severe. A military defeat would humilate Iraq, increase its resentments and make it thirst for future revenge. The possession of nuclear weapons in the future could become an Iraqi obsession. Yet, there should be ways in a post-war period to satisfy some of Iraq's demands, to keep it weak enough to prevent future aggression, and to obstruct its development of nuclear weapons. Furthermore, it is possible that Saddam Hussein would fall from power and be replaced by a leader with more modest and less bellicose aims. A war could inflame anti-western nationalism in many Arab states, which could destabilize the region, lead to the revolutionary overthrow of some conserva tive governments, and instigate a rise in terrorism. Most Arab governments should be able to withstand the tumult, however, and those that cannot could be"
If the embargo should finally compel,

The citizens of some Arab countries would benefit from more legitimate, responsive regimes, and it is unlikely that these new governments could afford to emulate Iraq or Libya in the new world order that would emerge. Any rise in terrorism is unlikely to be more than a passing nuisance. A severe Iraqi defeat could produce a power vac uum in the northern Middle East that could provoke conflict, as Syria, Iran or Turkey vie to fill the void. A destabilized region might require an expensive, diffi cult, long- term military presence. Yet, a strengthened United Nations should be up to the task of molding a security arrangement to preserve peace in the region. Warfare might cause the temporary destruc tion of oil facilities and disruption of shipping which would lift oil prices to record levels. Many experts, however, doubt that Iraq would have the ability to destroy its neighbors' oil facilities or to severely dis rupt the flow of oil. The rise in oil prices would be temporary and aid agencies could mitigate the effects on the most severely affected countries. There is always the chance that things could go awry and that the costs could be far greater than antici pated. If a war should be needed, however, the benefits of fighting it would seem to exceed the human costs. The loss of even a single life would be tragic, indeed. But, our imperfect world creates the unpleasant moral dilemma, where loss of life may sometimes be neces sary to attain other important principles. If a reluctance to risk lives should prevent the coalition from fighting Iraq, then potential aggressors across the world will take notice of this lack of resolve, and may begin to plot attacks on neighbors that would cause a far greater deathtoll than would war against Iraq next year. If the coalition should decide to wage war, then there must be one final limiting condition. A war should be proportionate and fought with restraint, using only as much force as necessary to accomplish the coalition's goals. It would be wrong to flatten Baghdad and to target civilian areas, when less force would be sufficient to dislodge Iraq from Kuwait. It is hoped that war can be avoided in the Persian Gulf. Indeed, the nonviolent measures of a sustained embargo and a more flexible diplomatic approach -- -- -- -- -- -- _ should be attempted in an effort to peace fully end Iraq's occupation of Kuwait. These ^ ------ -- initiatives should be given more time to work, certainly at least a year. The recent U.S. decision to double its strength in the Gulf was inadvisable because it could prematurely drive the region toward war. However, if the peaceful options should fail, then a war should be waged to force Iraq out of Kuwait, providing that the war adheres to moral guidelines and that the benefits out weigh the costs. It would be appropriate for the United States to participate in this war and to play a leading role, as long as it acts with the approval of the U.N. Security Council and the U.S. Congress. The reversal of Iraq's aggression, whether by peaceful or forceful means, would promote a more just, peaceful world order. While it would be preferable to move toward this world order through nonviolent measures, it looks increasingly like forceful means may have to be used in the Persian Gulf.

Thanksgiving spent in the sand,"By Marc Halmes I just finished watching the Macy's pre-game Thanksgiving parade and I'm overwhelmed!

You know, the one that involves extend ing your arm in the air while circling your fist and making a sound like a consti pated German Shep herd. Then the came ras showed some cheerful outdoor shots of the troops playing football, volleyball, relaxing in ham mocks, and generally making life in Saudi Arabia look just like summer camp...except with combat boots, nerve gas, and shorter hair. Then, at the very end of the heart-warming coverage, all the troops lined up and ruggedly shouted ""HAPPY THANKSGIVING!!!"" while Pumping and howling for about 20 minutes.

Football tramples Fordham 44-7,"Colin Bridgewater/The Bucknellian With a host of Fordham defenders hot on his heels, running back Kevin McElvene '93 bursts through the middle of the Ram defense for a big gain. By Scott Brown Staff Writer In the final game of the 1990, the Buckncll football team added a fitting exclamation point to its excellent 7-4 season by trouncing Fordham 44-7. The seventh win, the most since 1964, was sparked by the exceptional play of quarterback Todd Hatajik '91 who connected on 14 of 22 passes for 228 yards and three touchdowns. Hatajik finished the season as the second-rated quarterback in the Patriot League. His 21 touchdown passes breaks the school record of 19 set by Scott Auchcnbach last year. The Bison dominated the game from start to finish. They cap italized on their first possession driving 63 yards on 12 plays, culmi nating on a 3-yard completion from Hatajik to Jeff Pape '92. Pape, who was promoted to the starting job when Dennis Barnes '91 was injured, ended the season 15th in the Patriot League in pass receiving. He caught 26 passes for 342 yards and five touchdowns. The only other pass of the drive proved to be the longest play, a 19-yard comple tion to Lester Erb '91. On the next Bucknell drive, the offense extended the lead to 10- 0 after a 33-yard field goal from Todd Krutchkoff '91. The kick was"
W omen's hoops drops home,
"opener to Delaware, 86-76","By Todd Bianchine Staff Writer The Bucknell women's bas ketball team suffered a tough defeat last Wednesday, as it lost to the University of Delaware at home, 86-76. The Lady Blue Hens mounted a strong second-half rally to overtake and beat the Lady Bison. The loss drops Bucknell to 0-3 for the year, with their initial two losses coming over Thanksgiv ing break to Rice and Bradley in Rice's Holiday Classic in Houston, Texas. The first five minutes of the game produced very little scoring as both Buckncll and Delaware were unable to get on track shoot ing from the outside perimeter. The Colin Brldgewater/The Bucknellian Kirsten Ellison '92 finds the lane clogged with Lady Blue Hen defenders as she attempts to drive to the hoop. The Lady Bison fell to Delaware 86-76. Lady Bison then jumped out to a 13- 3 lead, led by Kelly Dee '94 who caught fire from long range banging down two three-pointers. Delaware called a time-out with 13 minutes remaining in the first half. The stoppage of play ben efited the Lady Blue Hens, as they answered Bucknell's call by rattling off the next nine points, all from Bucknell turnovers, to close within a single point. The Lady Bison then forced a full-court press on Delaware, and the hosts pushed their lead back up to seven at 23-16 with 5 minutes remaining. Delaware then brought in reserve center Rhonda Clifton, who ate up Bucknell's defense inside, cutting the margin once more. Then, with three seconds left in the half Clifton missed her sec ond free throw. The Lady Blue Hens got the rebound and quickly pushed the ball to forward Molly Larkin, who drilled a base line jumper at the buzzer to cut the Bucknell lead to four going into the second half. ""I don't think that (Larkin's jumper) was a turning point in the game,"" said Kelly Dee '94. ""We were still pretty pumped going into the locker room with the lead. We lost a few points off missed rebounds on free throws, we just have to learn to box people out bet ter because a lot of times we're smaller than the team we are playing."" Bucknell came out of the locker room with the idea that they wanted to get the ball inside to their front-court players, Julie Bachman GR and Kirsten Ellison '92. How ever that backfired on the Lady Bison, as they were unable to get a good shot on the Blue Hen defense. Not to be denied, Bachman took her game to the outside, where she hit a three-pointer to push Bucknell to a 43-34 lead. Once again, Delaware responded with Clifton, who came up with many crucial baskets inside and opened up the game for shoot ing guard Linda Cyborski, who was unstoppable from outside. Cyborski rammed home three straight jumpers from the outside as Delaware found itself up 48-47 after an uncontested layup off a fast break. Despite a Bucknell time out, Delaware continued to roll as point guard Bridget McCarthy finished See WOMEN'S HOOPS, page 13 Colin Brldgewater/The Bucknellian Tailback Brian Henesey '91 bulls his way for an extra yard during the Bison's 44-7 victory over Fordham. set up by a 25-yard catch by Erb. pared to only 111 for Fordham.

drops first two,"By Darren Millman Staff Writer The men's swimming team struggled in its first two meets of the 1990-91 season suffering a pair of losses to the likes of UMBC (138-103) and conference opponent Colgate (145-99). In the meet against UMBC, the visiting Bison experienced little success, as they captured only four individual victories. Don Stccnson '92 and diver Eric Carr '93 each contributed two wins to the Bison team effort. Steenson finished first in both the 200 meter individual medley (2:00.89) and the 200 meter back- stroke (1:58.46). Carr dove to vic tory in the 1-meter diving event by compiling a point total of 212.4. He followed this effort with a win in the 3-meter event with a total of 215.4 points. The Bison traveled to Colgate on November 18 to compete in their first Patriot League contest of the season.Bucknell came out strong and appeared poised to give the Red Raiders a run for their money. The tide quickly turned, however, and Colgate established a lead which it would not relinquish. In the meets initial event the Bison jumped out to the early lead by winning the 400 meter medley relay. The winning Bison relay team consisted of Steenson, Chad Farrell '92, Scott Dietrich '93, and Jay Gross '93. The winning time was 3:38.82. Bucknell's advantage was short-lived as the Red Raiders raced away with six of the next seven events. Three Bison swimmers managed to win individual events. Gross sped to victory in the 50 free style in a time of :21.89. Steenson won his third event of the season as he finsihed first in the 200 meter backstroke with a time of 2:00.03. Farrell contributed a victory to the Bison's cause by winning the 200 meter breaststroke (2:20.37). Buckncll will look to get its first win of the young season when the Explorers of LaSalle invade Rookc pool on December 8. 1 4 page 12 The Bucknellian November 30, 1990"

---------,"Eleven players from the Bison were elected to the All- Patriot League team. In addition. Head Coach Lou Maranzana was named Patriot League Coach of the Year. It will be difficult though for the Bison to be as successful next year as they were this year. Krutch- koff noted that ""next year's team will do really well. Coach will motivate them as well as or better than this year."" Eight of the 11 offensive starters will graduate at the end of this year, however, a powerful backfield consisting of Henesey, Walsh, and McElvene will return. Henesey rushed for 78 yards on 18 carries against the Rams to boost his season total to 815 yards, good enough for third best in the conference. He needs just 23 yards next season to reach the 2,000 yard mark for his career. He would become only the third player in Bucknell history to accomplish this feat He is more concerned about becoming a complete player next year rather than breaking records. He said, ""It would be great to achieve those records, but I'm thinking about improving my over all game, blocking and receiving. The running comes naturally."" More pressure will be placed on the backfield as Larry Czeponis '92 is the only starter returning from the offensive line, while Pape is the only starting receiver that will return. On defense, the Bison are in better shape as only six starters will be leaving. Bucknell will lose Bill Higgins '91, the team's leading tackier, as well as Trevor Smith '91, who led the conference this season with six interceptions. From page 11 off a three-point-play to make it 62-54 on Juliet McGee's '93 fourth foul with 7:30 to play. Bucknell and Delaware then traded baskets for the next five minutes, bringing the score to 76- 63 with two minutes remaining, when Lady Bison guard Joy San dler '92 came up with the hot hand from the outside, it brought Buck nell to within seven points at 80- 73. After a Delaware bucket, San dler responded with a three-pointer to bring them within six, but it was too little too late, as Bucknell was unable to capitalize off two missed Delaware free throws, and wound up losing 86-76. ""We live and die by the, Out side shot,"" said Sandler. ""We worked on getting the ball inside in practice but we just weren't able to do it today. We lost a little control on the fast break, but that will come with time."" ""I think we played a little defensive in the second half instead of coming out and doing the things we did well in the first half,"" said Dec. ""It seemed like we playing not to lose the lead, rather than playing to win, and I think its just a matter of coming out more determined and thinking your going to blow out the other team."" Bucknell also lost its games in the Rice Holiday Classic in Houston over break. The Lady Bison took on the host team Rice in the first game and dropped a tough one 80-66, despite a 20-point scor ing effort from Bachman. In the consolation game Bucknell lost another battle to Bradley 96-83, after a 22-point half by Sandler. Bachman finished the Bradley game with 21 points and was named to the All- Tournament team. Bucknell will look for its first victory of the year when they take on Princeton tomorrow at 2:30 p.m."

"Breakin' Bison dump Delaware, 81-72","Peter Ho/The Bucknellian Center Paul Olkowski '93 reaches for the tip-in along with Delaware's Denard Montgomery. The Brea- kin' Bison topped the Blue Hens 81-72 to improve their record to 3-1. By Tommy Abel Staff Writer With a smothering defense and a barrage of three-point shots led by Bill Courtney '92, who scored 28 points and dished off five assists, Bucknell defeated Delaware 81-72, Wednesday night. With 7:02 remaining in the game the Bison defense buckled down as the team went on a five minute, 15-3 run capped off by a thunderous Mike Bright '93 jam that brought 1,800 Bison fans to their feet The final two minutes of the game belonged to Courtney, who tallied the last ten points for the Breakin' Bison. Courtney went 8 for 8 from the charity stripe in the final minute and ended the game in style with an emotional two-handed dunk off a Bright steal, which put an exclama tion point on the victory for the Bison. The first half of the contest was played to a 37-37 draw with Bright and Courtney leading the way with 12 and ten points, respec tively. Keith Fenton '91 also added six first half points with two three- point bombs. The Bison guard rotation of Courtney, Fenton, and Russell Pey ton '93 which combined for 45 points, 18 assists, and 7 steals proved to be too much for the Dela ware squad. Courtney finished with a game high 28 points and five assists while Fenton added nine points, all on treys. Peyton might have played the most complete game of the three, contributing eight points, nine assists, six rebounds, and six steals in just 24 minutes of play. Fenton commented on Pey ton's play, ''Russ is just playing really solid. His play is just real consistent across the board."" Mike Bright also turned in another excep tional performance, scoring 21"
Grapplers place fifth and second,
in season's opening two tourneys,"By Jamie Diaferia Staff Writer The wrestling team opened its 1990-91 season at the Blooms- burg Invitational on November 17th with an impressive second- place finish. The team also partici pated in the MAT Town Invite in Lock Haven on November 24th, placing fifth in a competitive field of thirteen teams. Bucknell's success in the tournaments is an encouraging sign as the wrestlers head into the tough James Madison Invite this Sunday. All indications point to a winning season in which the Bison could finish among the top twenty teams in the country. At the Bloomsburg Invita tional, Bucknell accomplished ""an excellent performance"" according to Head Coach Bob Ferraro. The Bison finished second in a ""very talented"" field of teams behind Bloomsburg, a squad they beat last year despite only losing two players from the previous season. Individually, six Bucknell grapplers made it to the finals of the tournament. The Bison crowned two champions of the invitational, tri-captains Tom Marcheui '91 (167 lbs.) and Bryan Bums '91 (190 lbs.). The other tri-captain, John Walizer '91, injured his knee before the season and will be out of action until January. Currently Marchetti is ranked 7th in the nation, Bums is 11th, Chris Doukas '91 (134 lbs.) is 18th, and Mike Van Doren '92 (142 lbs.) is 32nd. At the MAT Town Invite, Bucknell had another strong show ing, resulting in a fifth-place finish out of thirteen schools. Bucknell was the only university competing at the Invite which does not offer athletic scholarships. Penn State, currently ranked fifth in the country, won the tourna ment, followed by Syracuse, Rider and North Carolina State. One team that the Bison finished ahead of was Oregon, currently ranked seven teenth in the country. Marchetti won the tournament in his weight class, while Bums finished second, Ken Herceg '92 (177 lbs.) third and Van Doren fifth, each in their respective divisions. Bucknell hopes to continue its success of the past two weeks when it heads for Virginia and the JMU Invite this weekend. Blooms burg will be participating in the tournament as well. Ferraro noted, ""This will be a good test to see if we can come back and beat them [Bloomsburg] after losing to them earlier."" Also participating in the tourney will be Duke, Old Domin ion, Millersville, American and Howard. Ferraro's goal is to have the Bison finish in the top two in this tournament, a goal he sees as ""very reasonable."" See WRESTLING, page 13"

He hit three three-pointers in the 81- 72 win over Delaware. points, pulling down a team high nine boards and dishing off five assists. Pat King '92 was also able to effectively contribute to the team's success by playing 38 solid minutes and tossing in ten points. Before Wednesday night's game, the Breakin' Bison had just returned from a very successful outing in the San Juan Shootout, which was held over Thanksgiving break. Coach Woollum commented on the tournament by saying, ""1 think we accomplished everything we could have dreamed of accom plishing. I think that we realized in order to beat teams we have to play hard, and we did."" The Bison went 2-1 in a three day tournament that featured some of the top talent in the country: Illi nois, Nebraska, Murray State, St. Louis, Northern Iowa, Old Dorn in in Puerto Rico. The trip was able to offer the team much more than bas ketball experience as Coach Wool lum explains, ""I think it was an educationally sound trip because we got to sec another culture so to speak, with different languages and a little different lifestyle. And I think all that was a total benefit for our program and our kids."" In their first game the Bison faced a tough Murray St. team, but were still able to jump out to a ten point halftime lead. Unfortunately for the Bison, the Racers' size and experience caught up with them in the second half, as Bucknell dropped its first game of the season 81-68. Leading the charge for the Bison were Courtney 18 points, Fenton 14 points, and Paul Olkow ski '93 who added 15 points. Bucknell was able to turn it around in the second game as they came from behind in the second half before defeating Northern Iowa 71-57. The team was led by Courtney who scored a team high 25 points. He was later selected to the All-ToumamcntTcam. In the third game against a very talented St. Louis club , the Bison certainly demonstrated their flexibility and a well balanced scor ing attack that featured four players in double figures. The most inspiration play of the game though might have come from King who netted 20 points and swiped 13 boards, eight of them offensive, and is credited by Coach Woollum for keeping the team in the first half. ""Pat kept us in the first half. If Pat doesn't just tear up the glass and get fouled and make his foul shots then we get way behind and maybe we don't catch up."" The Bison finally prevailed by eclipsing the century mark, 103- 93. Bright tallied 25 points and five rebounds while Courtney chipped in 21 points and four assists. Fen ton also contributed 12 points, all on treys. Peyton sparked the Bison as well with his consistent play; add ing nine points, four rebounds, four assists, and three steals. The Breakin' Bison will face Yale tomorrow night in a game. The Bulldogs arc picked to win the Ivy League this season and have already placed second in the Stan ford Invitational. In order to win, Bucknell must play hard for the entire 40 minutes."
Women's swimming,

She took the 100 meter (:54.43), 200 meter (1:58.77), and 500 meter (5:20.04) freestyle events. She attributed her fast early- season times to the fact that she trained over the summer and entered the season in good condi tion, both physically as well as mentally. Andrea Falcione '92 swam away with a victory in the remain ing sprint event with a time of :25.27. The Lady Bison teamed up to race away with the 400 freestyle relay event Falcione anchored the team that also featured Kathleen Harnett '94, Peggy Hovis '94, and tri-captain Kelly Appier '91.

BU Crime,
rate tops PA,"By Steve Hoerter Staff Writer Bucknell University has the highest crime rate per 1,000 stu dents in the state o f Pennsylvania, according to a USA Today crime statistics report published Monday. That rating, however, is being called misleading by Vice President for Administration Barry Maxwell and recently appointed Director of Security and Safety, Vince DeCerchio. The report lists Bucknell as having 62 crime incidents per thou sand students per year --  which translates into approximately 217 students affected by crime on cam pus each year. Included in the report were 32 other private and public institutions in Pennsylvania, including urban schools such as the University of Pennsylvania, Tem ple University and the University of Pittsburgh. Some schools, how ever, refused to participate in the survery or were not contacted by USA Today for statistics. Maxwell responded to Buck- nell's ranking yesterday by saying that, ""the statistics shown for Buck nell are high because in our classifi cation scheme we have included all acts o f vandalism and petty theft."" He continued, "" It appears that the other institutions have not [included such incidents]."" M ax well added, ""What's really impor tant are the incidents of serious crimes"" of which Bucknell only had 5."" In an interview yesterday. See C R IM E , page 2"

Faculty/administration,
upset by trustee budget,
Tempers flared as reputations were put on the line,"Peter Ho/The Bucknellian Bill Courtney '92 lays the ball in for two during a game against Yale last Saturday. See story on the Breakin' Bison, page 18. By Travis Elliott Staff Writer A  dispute has erupted over the proposed increase in the com prehensive fee for the 1991-92 school year, pitting the faculty and administration against the Board of Trustees. During the faculty meet ing on Monday, Barry Maxwell, Vice-President for Administration, characterized the debate over the increase in the comprehensive fee during the meeting of the Finance Committee as "" heated and down right angry"" and said the exchange contained "" unprofessional rhetoric."" Professor of management, John Miller, said, ""The discussion in the early part of the meeting was fairly straightforward, but then it took a turn and became heated."" Following the recommenda tion from the Board's Finance Committee, the Board of Trustees voted 28-6 to reject the Budget Subcommittee's proposal to increase the comprehensive fee by 6.7% for the '91-92 Fiscal year. On Friday, the Finance Committee had previously decided to reject the Budget Subcommittee's recommen dation and instead to send the bud get back to campus with a recom mendation for an increase in the comprehensive fee which was not to exceed 4.5%. In a letter to members of the faculty, President Gary Sojka"
S.T.O.P. protest spawns campus debate,"By Michael M cGandy Staff Writer ""I think what S.T.O.P. is doing is good to increase aware ness, but I am not sure what they are trying to achieve beyond that,"" Andree Levally '92 said. ""What do they want us to do beyond being aware is my question to them."" Levally's statement, offered over some class work she was doing in the Bison, in many ways summarizes the campus' response to the activist group Students and Teachers Organized for Peace (S.T.O.P.). During the past few weeks S.T.O.P. has engaged in numerous activities, including a protest in front o f the Lewisburg Post Office and an open forum on Wednesday night, to engage stu dents in the issues surrounding the American presence in the Persian Gulf. In a not very scientific, but representative survey of twelve undergraduate men and women spending the late-morning hours in the Bison, seven stated that they were supportive o f S.T.O .P. insofar as they were attempting to make this campus more aware of the situ ation in the Persian Gulf. Yet, as Levally said, there are questions amongst the student body as to what S.T .O .P. is working toward and what the goal of their activism is. O f those students ques tioned many expressed concern that S.T.O .P. might have a political agenda that went beyond informing the campus of the status of this nation's foreign involvement. ""I found a lot o f things they say to be interesting and that they raise a lot of important issues,"" Rob Hess '91 said about S.T.O.P. "" Yet I am not sure exactly what would be their motives or intent if we went to war. I would not be supportive of any activities that resembled the burning o f draft cards."" Yancy Molnar '91 went fur ther and said that the activities of S.T.O.P. are divisive. "" I really do not agree with what they say; I think it only separates people. In case like this what we want to be is together and if it comes to war, we do nofrneed protests."" Most of those people who responded, though, did not express opposition, but rather uncertainty about S.T.O.P. In general it appears that there is a lack of knowledge about the organization itself and, as a result, students are not willing to associate themselves with the group beyond its role as an educator. Yet, insofar as in favor of peaceful solutions to the Persian Gulf crisis every Friday in front of the Lewisburg Post Office on Market Street. About last Friday's demon stration Janota said, "" I feel that the demonstration went very well. We began with a little under twenty people and at the conclusion there were about fifty with us."" wrote, ""Though many rational arguments to the contrary were pre sented and though many of us from the campus community virtually staked our reputations as profes sionals in the field on the campus proposal, the Finance Committee was ultimately swayed by those who were advocating a comprehen sive fee increase of no greater than 4.5%. Though some of us had our professional sensibilities wounded, many members of the Board have gone out of their way to make it clear that their action was prompted by the dire predictions for the health of the cconomy[sic] rather than any lack of confidence in the campus process."" Miller said, "" [Trustee] Ken Langone ['57], who is not a mem ber of the Committee, asked to come and address the committee. Since he is not a regular member of the committee, he was unfamiliar with the history behind the propo sal, as well as the procedures used by the committee. He was very powerful and passionate and a number of the members of the com mittee were taken back by Lan- gone's comments. While a number of committee members were sup portive of Langone's observations about the state of the economy, many committee members noted S.T.O.P. is working to inform stu dents about the dynamics of the armed standoff on the Kuwati bor der they seem to be widely appreciated. Over her lunch Jennifer Hay- taian '91 said that she found the efforts of S.T.O.P. to be very help ful. ""I think it is good. I wish I was more knowledgeable on the sub ject,"" she explained. 'The amount of time we spend in the classroom and with our studies keeps us from engaging the issues."" Mollie Janota '91 of S.T.O.P. said that she was pleased that the organization was progress ing and making an impact on the campus. In addition to campus based activities, S.T.O.P. has undertaken to hold a demonstration ""That we were out there and had a good gathering says a lot; we have sparked people to take some kind of action,"" Janota stated. ""We will definitely be out there every week until there is a resolution."" Yet, while much of the stu dent body is cautious and con cerned about the prospects of war and its implications for their lives, there is also a sense that many do not see an alternative to using force to resolve the impasse with Iraq. Those students questioned in the Bison were mostly reluctant to engage this nation in a military con flict, but some also believe that the use of force may be necessary. "" I am not advocating war, but, if in a couple of months things continue like they are now, then that cost is not the only factor."" Langone was unable to be reached for comment, but Lee Idle- man '54, Chairman of the Board of Trustees, speculated that Langone was concerned with the state of the economy and the affordability of a Bucknell education. Idleman stressed that increases in the com prehensive fee, along with a lack of financial aid, have placed Bucknell out of the price range of many mid dle class families. Idleman admit ted that Bucknell had a lower com prehensive fee than most of its frame of reference schools, but he said that much of the difference could be based on lower cost of liv ing in the Lewisburg area than for many metropolitan schools. He also noted that Buckncll's tuition, excluding room and board, is not unusually low in comparison with the frame-of-rcference schools. Barry Maxwell said, ""As a result of the discussion that ensued during the meeting on Friday after noon, the finance committee decided not to accept the budget committee's recommendation, but rather to recommend to the trustees that the budget matter be sent back to campus to develop guidelines built around a 4.5% comprehensive fee increase. That was subsequently See T R U ST E E S , page 5 there is no choice but to fight Huss ein,"" Jen Atherton '91 said. "" If we just pull out we are condoning Hussein's acts."" Matt Lowrey '93 said of the situation in the Persian Gulf, ""I think it is distressing, but I still think we need to have our forces there. We cannot pull out as things now stand."" Ashley Chertkof/The Bucknellian Students and area residents protested the conflict in the Persian G u lf in front of the United States Post Office on Market Street last Friday. S.T .O .P . has planned a similar demonstration for today, from 4 to 5:30 p.m."
SAMS to hold dance,
marathon in Bison,"By Tara Gilligan Staff Writer Students Against Multiple Sclerosis (SAM S) and 65 co sponsors will host a 24-hour dance marathon scheduled to begin tonight at 8 p.m. in the Bison. Most of the expected $10,000 profit will go to the regional MS office in Williamsport. The dance has two intended purposes: first, to raise money for the M S Foundation; and second, to unite students and faculty in a campus-wide activity. ""Our goal is to involve every living person on campus... This is an all encom passing event,"" said Joe Krakoff, co-chair of the Dance-for-a- Chance committee. Only 75 percent of the dance's profits will be donated to the regional MS office. Organiza tions will be competing, based on a point system, for the remaining 25 percent of profits. The winning organization will be allowed to donate the remainder of the money to the philanthropy of its choice. Individuals on campus became involved primarily through participation in one of the 65 organizations co-sponsoring the event. Though only three peo ple attended the initial interest meeting held last spring, organiza tions agreed to help as the project grew in size. "" People began thinking, 'Wow, I want to get involved because this is going to be a really big event,"" ' said Krakoff. Individuals will not be required to stay on the dance floor for the entire 24 hours. Students affiliated with campus organiza tions will, for the most part, dance as members of "" tag teams."" Students on tag teams will dance in blocks of one hour. Dur ing that hour, only two to four stu dents from a particular organiza tion will be allowed on the dance floor. The dance has been broken down into 24 theme hours. Differ ent organizations volunteered to sponsor each hour. The evening will begin with Bucknell Student Government's Hawaiian Beach Party Hour and end with Techni cal Service's Trivia Hour. Within each theme hour, organizations will provide not only music, but other entertainment as well. BSG , during its hour, will sponsor a limbo contest. Members of SAM S expect to raise $10,000 by selling tickets at the door for a dollar a piece. Throughout the 24 hour time See SA M S, page 5 If this perspective is as perva sive amongst the student body as a whole as it was in the small sam pling of students questioned in the Bison, it may be hard to reconcile most students with the position of a member of S.T.O .P., in a letter to the editor in the November 16 edi tion of The Bucknellian. "" I believe the United States has absolutely no legitimacy in tak ing the role it has assumed in the Persian Gulf crisis,"" Sarah Pryor of S.T.O.P. wrote. "" I believe what our country has done is wrong and offensive and I will struggle to stop the United States' military actions."" If this contrast of viewpoints See ST O P , page 2"

Bucknellian,"December 7, 1990 page 2"
Campus debates role in Gulf,
Anti-war sentiments abound on campus,"Compiled by Mike McGandy Staff Writer 1) What is your opinion con cerning the present situation in the Gulf? Paul Kahn '91: ""Previously I thought that 1 was pretty certain how I felt, but now as the crisis develops I get more confused since 1 cannot be sure if we arc there for economic reasons or to oppose aggression. I think it is a little of both, but I am not sure. If we are there because of economic reasons then I am not in favor of our position."" Becky Tyler '92: ""As with everyone, I am not very happy with the situation. I am pleased that recently we have expressed a willingness to talk, but as we have gotten to this point 1 cannot see us simply back out."" Rob Hess '91: ""I think it is kind of scary. I have a friend at Lamda Chi Alpha who is in the reserves and has already been contacted for duty. It is becoming increasingly possible that war will occur. I think it is kind of strange that they arc saying that if there is a war it would be con cluded quickly, because that is exactly the same thing they said before Vietnam."" Kate Baker '91: ""I am dis pleased with the escalation and sending more and more troops over there. The US should allow more time for economic sanctions to work--perhaps a year. Because of this I really do not agree with the January 15th date set by the United Nations."" Mark Luecke '93: ""I feel that Bush has backed himself into it by saying that he wants Hussein out of power. He has made war almost inevitable unless Iraq backs out."" Anna DiDomenico '93: ""The threat of war scares me and I think that it is a sticky situation that has to be dealt with cau tiously due to the possible disas trous results that could arise, such as nuclear war."" Linda Massa '92: ""The pos sibility that we may go to war is very scary. But I really feel that we should not be there in the first place. It just seems to me that the U.S. always has to involve itself in something to uphold itself as a world power."" Yancy Molnar '91: ""I think we have solid reasons for being there, but we should not push for military action. We should con sider the propaganda involved in the US position, before we get involved. We need to be clear what it is we are fighting for."" Robert Semenak '91: ""I have mixed emotions. I respect the idea of aiding other countries. There should be something to pre vent nations from being invaded, in theory. But in this situation we would not be there if it were not for the oil. We should not be there based on our motives."" Matt Lowrcy '93: ""I think it is distressing, but I still think we need to have our forces there. We cannot pull out as things now stand."" Andrcc Lcvally '92: ""I am hoping that the situation docs not come to war. It seems necessary to put pressure on Hussein, but at the same time it seems that we have so many troops over there and if we put too much pressure on him we may push too far; we might be creating more problems than we arc solving. I understand why we arc there, but I do not want it to turn into another Vietnam. It is a ""Catch-22""--we have interests to defend but we might also provoke another conflict like Vietnam."" Chris Bowen '91: ""We should not be involved. It is not our concern and it is probably one of the stupidest things we could be doing. We are just there to protect our own oil interest and I find this to be pretty stupid and disgusting."" Jen Atherton '91: ""We have already sent all of this money and troops over there and it would be a blow to our national pride if we pulled out. I am not advocating war, but if in a couple of months things continue like they are now then there is no choice but to fight Hussein. If we just pull out we are condoning Hussein's acts."" Jennifer Haytaian '91: ""Obvi ously I think that war is not a good thing and I hate to see a loss of life. So I hope the situation docs not come to that."" 2) How do you feel about the prospects for a draft? Jennifer Haytaian '93: ""I think it is scary. I do have an older brother and I am afraid for him."" Chris Bowen '91: ""The way things arc looking the odds are we might have one. Again, it is a stu pid thing because we should not be there. I would not have a problem with fighting and even dying for my country if the cause were worthwhile, though."" Jen Atherton '91: ""I do not sec the need for a draft at this point. Yet, if there is a draft, women should be eligible as well."" Malt Lowrcy '93: ""The pros pect for a draft docs not excite me at all. I think one should support the draft if we think our forces should be there. So it stands that I would support the draft with reser vations about our reasons for being involved."" Andree Levally '92: ""If it does come to that I guess the draft is the way to get troops. Without a draft it is questionable how many people would join. It is a duty and yet if you do not believe in the war it is a difficult situation."" Yancy Molnar '91: ""I would fight if there was a draft, but I am not in a hurry to go."" Robert Semenak '91: ""Terri ble. I do not relish the idea of being in the service and especially the idea of being given a gun."" Anna DiDomenico '93: ""It upset me because it would be my friends and people I care for that would be taken. It is a new concept to this generation and it is difficult for me to conceive of a draft."" Kate Baker '91: ""I would be unaffected by the draft, personally, but I would not want to think that my family and friends would be going over; so I would be against the draft."" Mark Lucke '93: ""It seems to me that if we go to war it is nec essary. If we go to war we should have a draft."" Becky Tyler '92: ""Not great. I hope it docs not have to be instated."" Rob Hess '91: ""The prospect of a draft docs not bother me. I was surprised that the legislation had changed so that college students would not be exempt and actually I feel that it is kind of good. It is not fair that those not in college because of their socio-economic situation or otherwise should fight for their country and not those who are in college."" Paul Kahn '91: ""If sanctions arc given a chance to work a lot of time will be needed. With 250,000 troops over in Saudi Arabia, in order to rotate them a draft would be necessary. If we go in on Janu ary 15th and it is over in a month there would be no need for a draft. I am an American citizen and 1 would stand by our country. I would have some problems with fighting, but I would not jump ship, that is for sure."" 3) What are you feelings about the activities of the organization STOP? Paul Kahn '91: ""I am sup portive of them. I do not think that enough people at Bucknell keep track of current events and I also think trying to get professors involved adds a little more legiti macy to their public appearance."" Rob Hess '91: ""I found a lot of things they say to be interesting and that they raise a lot of impor tant concerns. These concerns need to be brought into the spotlight. Yet I am not sure exactly what would be their motives and intent if we went to war. I would not be supportive of activities that resem bled the burning of draft cards. What they are saying, though, is important."" Becky Tyler '92: ""I think it is great. I wish I could participate more in some of the activities because they are working for a good cause."" Kate Baker '91: ""I feel that they have been productive and educational for the entire campus."" Mark Luekc '93: ""I don't really know much about it or what they have done."" Anna DiDomenico '93: ""I think what they have been doing is promoting awareness. They may provoke rude comments, but it does get people to think."" Linda Massa '92: ""I really support what they have been doing. It is good to make stu dents aware of what is going on and make them more involved. The issue is big enough that eve rybody knows about it, but groups like STOP arc doing a good job in getting people engaged in the issues."" Robert Semenak '91: ""I think that it is good if for nothing else than to create more awareness."" Yancy Molnar '91: ""I really do not agree with what they say. I think it only separates people internally. In cases like this what we want to be is together and if it comes to war, we do not need protests."" Andree Levally '92: ""I think what they are doing is good to increase awareness, but I am not sure what they are trying to achieve beyond that What do they want us to do beyond being aware is my question to them."" Mark Lowrcy '93: ""I think essentially if what they arc doing is notifying the campus it is good, but if they were to turn toward negative propaganda it is another thing. The tombstones were a good way to let the cam pus know what has been going on. Informing the Bucknell cam pus is fine, but if they go beyond that it is simply a matter of them expressing their opinion."" Jen Atherton '91: ""I really do not know much about it. I think they have done a lot to make people aware and that is a good thing. Yet we might have to bring about war to bring peace to the region."" Chris Bowen '91: ""All I really know is that they staged a protest I heard the cops were ready to hassle them if they stepped out of line. We have a lot of misguided Americans. STOP has the right idea and they arc getting a lot of grief. You can protest war and still be a patriotic American."" Jennifer Haytaian '91: ""I think it is good. I wish I was more knowledgeable on the sub ject. The amount of time we spend in the classroom and with our studies keeps us from engag ing the issue."""

Crime,"From page 1 Vince DcCcrchio questioned the reporting methods of the other schools surveyed. ""There arc some serious questions as to the methods some of those schools used for classifying and compiling [their] statistics,"" DcCcrchio said. He continued, ""there is no uniform methodology across the nation for crime classification or compilation."" Maxwell, in a separate inter view, said ""[this discrepancy in reporting] illustrates the kinds of differences that occur between institutions in counting [crimes on campus]."" Maxwell said, ""clearly we have counted everything, as a result of that, we look unusually high."" DeCerchio also called into question Bucknell's own classifica tion system which he will be reviewing in coming weeks. DeCerchio said ""in the past, we were classifying [accidents] as vandalism--incidents in which there was no evidence of criminal intent."" DcCcrchio added that in order for an incident to be classi fied as a crime, criminal intent must be apparent. DcCcrchio said that while Bucknell will not change its policy of reporting all incidents of crime on campus, the classification sys tem will be reviewed to determine if there are any discrepancies. Maxwell said ""we will not 'cook the books' to make [the university] look better."" He did, however, state ""the review of Buckncll's classification system is in order."" Citing lower crime rates on campus than in communities at large, DcCcrchio said ""any campus is the same as any other commu nity in the U.S. Campuses experi ence the same ills and problems that any other community experi ence. The members of our [cam pus] community need to take the same precautions as other commu nities [do]."""

Halloween incident reveals,
parallels to beer riots of 1954,"By Brian Hutchinson Staff Writer ""After six years of study, trial, and experience in efforts to control student drinking, the Execu tive Committee issued a statement on September 22 stating that the "" -- --^ -  use and posscs-"
News,"sion of alcoholic A n n l v u i v beverages, nor- A i t a i y s i s"
mally banned in,"---- -- -- -- all university buildings, would hereafter be banned as well in the fraternity houses."" Thus began a letter from the administration to alumni in November 1954. The announce ment of the controversial new pol icy was made by the Executive committee at a meeting with the fraternity presidents and social chairmen, as well as a number of the alumni advisors of the fraternities. During the following week, the fraternities, through the Inter- fraternity Council, were arduously discussing and formulating a propo sal of compromise on drinking in fraternity houses to be presented to the Executive Committee for con sideration. Prior to this accomplish ment, however, some students dis played publicly their dislike for the new regulation. Student demonstra tions against the ruling occurred on Sunday and Monday nights, Octo ber 3 and 4. According to the Octo ber 10, 1954 edition of The Sun- bury Item, the first manifestation against the ban occurred late Sun day night when between 300 and 350 students left a campus bonfire and paraded through the streets of Lewisburg to Second and Market Streets where a sit-down strike in the intersection was quickly broken *up by two officers of the Milton detail of state police, the demon strations offering no violent opposi tion. 'The parade was accompanied by a chanting for beer, which was continued back on campus after the state police officers indicated that they would brook no further fool ishness,"" read the Item. The following night, a sec ond, less impressive, but larger exhibition brought approximately 500 members of the student body to Market Street, but after about 45 minutes of leaderless activity, the group returned peaceably to cam pus where the songs and chants ""We want beer"" continued until about 11:30 when most of the group returned to fraternities and dormitories. The Item clarified, ""In both displays of opposition by the students, no property damage resulted nor were there any injuries reported. In its issue following the demonstration, The Bucknellian devoted about one and one-third pages to the liquor ban. The editors repeatedly voiced their assent with and support of the sentiment expressed in the demonstration. However, they also concluded that because of the demonstrations, any chance for repeal of the prohibition law had been lost In the October 7, 1954, issue of The Bucknellian, this conclusion is embodied in an edito rial entitled, ""Sound and Fury, Accomplishing Nothing,"" which admitted, ""The best interests of the student body were not served by the demonstrations. Just when it seemed that the Student Faculty Congress and the Interfratcmity Council were about to effect a reconsideration of the recent ruling by the Executive Committee, bed lam broke loose."" On students defeating their own purpose, the editors commented, ""We hope our fatalistic attitude will not discou rage responsible leaders in Student Faculty Congress and the Intetfra- temity Council from working out a compromise plan. It should have been their problem all along."" While the gatherings here in 1990 served more to bring an issue immediately to the forefront thereby accelerating an adjustment process, the ""beer riots of 1954"" resulted only in solidifying an already universally accepted change in policy. Despite the con trast in the two demonstrations' ramifications, the issues and the rhetoric are strikingly concurrent. To explain the contradictory results of the ""riots"", one needs only to be reminded of the very different psy chological environment in which the 1954 commotion took place. The Executive Committee decision was supported both inter nally and externally by the Buck- ncll community at the time of the 1954 prohibition. The Bucknell University Father's Association went on record as unconditionally endorsing the Universities stand on alcoholic beverages. The two gov erning bodies of the students, the Women's Student Government Association and the Men's Student Assembly, expressed to Bucknell University their sincere regret ""for the detrimental publicity resulting from the recent demonstration."" Disregarding for the moment the moral and historical back ground involved, the university officials were practically compelled to recognize the fact that a large percentage of the student body was underage, and that to repeal the reg ulation would, in effect, condone the breaking of the Pennsylvania State Laws. The press coverage depicting the peaceful gatherings as ""juvenile displays"" drew so much widespread attention to the pro tests, that the administration could not possibly announce a policy repeal without receiving much criti cism. Coupled with this priority to preserve the public image was a community that, in addition to already limiting its sale of alcoholic beverages to beer, was highly relig ious and exemplified a morality that typified the 1950's mentality. The salient subject for discus sion here, though, is not a policy or a riot, but more important are the issues that arouse a student body to unify and collectively protest a situ ation in which it is seemingly com pelled to live. Once an analysis goes beyond identifying surface similarities of the 1954 and 1990 circumstances by comparing the real issues and what the people said and felt about them, the scenarios are very much compatible. In the Thursday, October 7, 1954 edition of The Bucknellian, the editors asserted, ""We feel that the adminis tration should be roundly con demned for forcing upon the stu dents a ruling so sudden in its effect without even consulting their elected representatives."" The Sun- bury Item of October 6, 1954, stated that the senior class met and had, by majority vote, adopted a resolution condemning the Univer sity's action. One student spoke, saying that, ""While the University seems to feel that only a minority of the students is interested in the matter, I believe that the entire stu dent body has reacted violently to the edict."" He also asserted that the main reason for the adoption of the resolution was that ""students felt that they had not been given a chance to police the drinking prob lem themselves, that suggestions presented by the Interfratcmity Council had been ignored and action taken without consulting them."" Other students expressed a similar viewpoint indicating that ""the demonstrations may not be so much against the action taken by the University's Executive Com mittee as the manner in which it was taken."" These are the kinds of feel ings with which today's Bucknell students have been most acquainted. Statements such as these manifest an absence of repre sentation and normal channels of protest by which authority figures are checked. In the October 14, 1954 issue of The Bucknellian, a writer claims, ""There are those who say that the 'riots' were childish and immature. If the conditions on our campus had been different, I might be inclined to agree. Some times, however, when no conven tional or democratic process is. available for appealing a grievance, more radical methods must be used."" In the October 21 edition at a meeting with student leaders and the members of the Executive Committee, the participants felt that ""better communications between the student body and administration is what is needed."" In 1954 it was realized that stu dent participation through its effec tively powerless student groups was non-existent. Over the next months this problem was actively addressed. By 1956 at an Executive Committee meeting with student leaders, according to the meeting's minutes, the Committee reaffirmed the policy established in 1949 by the Board of Trustees, believing that it reflected the traditional atti tude of Bucknell University and was in its best interest. The state ment of policy reads: ""Possession or use of alcoholic beverages on the campus including fraternity houses, is completely opposed to the best interests of Bucknell and any use thereof resulting in discredit to Bucknell should be handled with the utmost severity."" Ultimately, then, the student voice was heard. Prohibition was realized to be contrary to the basic purpose of the University to teach discrimination and judgement. Stu dents must be given the chance to develop and prove themselves capable in the area of self- government. Not prohibiting is no longer thought of as condoning the violation of state laws--a belief which characteristic of a mentality which methods and definitions are inappropriate and inapplicable to today's college life. Today, the concern is not necessarily focussed on preventing the consumption of alcohol but more on ensuring responsible drinking and the exemption from liabilities. What has been found is that to accom plish this goal most effectively, stu dents must do the majority of the patrolling themselves. Upon this realization begins a movement toward the ideal situa tion in which the very same indi viduals that the University is trying to protect and prepare will collec tively and responsibly look out for one another. Instead of creating its own problems from within, all par ties involved will be better enabled to pursue those goals which they all ultimately share. As long as stu dents are responsible, the Univer sity will not take steps to repossess the autonomy with which the stu dents have been entrusted. The term ""responsibility"", however, tends to cause one to think of an additional burden. Also inherent in the idea of responsibility is the option to not live up to it; to fall short of its fulfillment. To better insure that the responsibility is ful filled, students should at least view their improved social situation more as a privilege. The term privi lege, in contrast, indicates some thing of value with which one would be most disinclined to part. With this perspective, each individ ual will be most effective in ensur ing that this responsibility is ful filled by not allowing himself or those around him to jeopardize or exploit the privilege. By way of looking back over the course of events both in 1954 and 1990, it is concluded that the people involved were not a group of unfortunate individuals caught coincidentally in a momentary tran sition. The removal of the spotlight from the subject may suggest that the experience is fleeting in nature. The issue is part of never-ending debate and process involving deep evaluations of what is moral and just, that will always shape the defi nition of what is in ""the best inter ests"" of society. Here at Bucknell, students have been well repre sented. The improvements that are in the making addressing the most pressing of student concerns dem onstrate an administration-student relationship that no longer culti vates a student frustration with the whole political process. With a more mature and realistic perspec tive, both the Administration and the students have responded very well to this very tough interest con flict--a kind of struggle that stands the test of time--by realizing that only in an environment of openness and cooperation can they harmoni ously coexist."

DeCerchio clarifies,
enforcement policy,"By Mark Leister Staff Writer Amid rumors of inconsistent University alcohol policy enforce ment, Vincent DcCcrchio, director of security and safety, sent a letter to members of the Greek commu nity in an attempt to clarify mis conceptions about security's role. DcCcrchio explained that his plan for a ""fair and reasonable enforce ment policy,"" though not harass ing like past policies, would ""not give any member of the university community the license to misbe have or to violate the law."" DcCcrchio's letter, which linked responsible student action to the right of self-determination, was intended to give students some understanding of the changes DeCerchio will imple ment. DeCerchio expanded on his letter by stating, ""Some members of the community felt that my approach to enforcement of the university alcohol policy would be interpreted as leniency or giving in. I felt it was important for me to clarify my purpose."" His intention, he explained, is to combine the enforcement of Commonwealth laws with the respect that students, as adults, deserve. 'The law says you can't serve [alcohol to] anyone under 21. We'll enforce that to a reason able degree. But not even the police department goes into houses or bars every night and cards everybody. That would be considered a form of harassment."" DeCerchio believes that his plan of enforcement contrasts a time when ""past enforcement may have exceeded the requirements of the law."" Mike Dominguez '91, presi dent of the Intcr-fratcmily Coun cil, secs DcCcrchio's intentions as positive and true to actions thus far. ""We're not finding [security] sitting in the parking lot any longer, or making any unneces sary inspections."" Dominguez appears realistic, however, in his assessment that, though ""enforce ment has decreased over the year, security isn't going to just disappear."" But DcCcrchio stands will ing to at least stand back and give students a chance. In his letter, he demonstrated a ""firm conviction that university students have the capabilities to govern them selves."" If self-govcmance proves ineffective, however, ""someone will be assigned to do it for [the students]."" Dominguez felt DeCerchio, through his statement, ""wanted to re-emphasize his com mitment to enforcing the law."" However, a complement to the proposal of student self- governance is the Student Advi sory Committee for Security and Safety. Student and administrator committee-members, meeting for the first time today, will strive toward a more uniform set of guidelines by which Security can operate and the university commu nity can live. Dominguez, who is ""pleased with the attitudes displayed by fra ternity leaders and their willing ness to work with security,"" sees the changes in a positive light. ""By not playing by the rules, we'd only be hurting ourselves."""

Milton man,
charged,"By Tara Gilligan Staff Writer Following a joint investiga tion by East Buffalo Township and Lewisburg Police, Richard A. Diehl of Milton faces criminal charges for a number of incidents involving indecent exposure which occurred on or near the Bucknell campus. Diehl, 28, was charged with five counts of indecent exposure, five counts of harrassment, five counts of disorderly conduct and one count of criminal attempt stem ming from indecent exposure. Charges were filed on November 29 with District Justice Leo S. Armbrustcr. The five inci dents of indecent exposure occurred within the borough of Lewisburg between November 1989 and June 1990. Diehl's charges are in refer ence to five individual incidents which took place on the south side of Lewisburg. Each of the five inci dents involved women jogging, biking or walking. Diehl was una ble to be reached for comment. East Buffalo Township and Lewisburg Police worked together on the investigation and will file similar charges against Diehl. Diehl, of 242 S.

Court protects,
suspects' rights,"The Supreme Court voted 6- 2 on Tuesday to limit police in the questioning of suspects without counsel. In a decision which over turned a 1988 Mississippi Supreme Court ruling, the Court decided that once a suspect has asserted his right to a lawyer, police cannot interrogate him until the lawyer is present. Justice Anthony M. Ken nedy, who wrote the majority opin ion said the Mississippi ruling did not protect suspects against ""coer cive pressures"" by police. Accord ing to the Mississippi ruling, once a suspect was provided with a law yer, police could question a sus pected criminal regardless of whether the lawyer was present. Kennedy claimed the ruling was necessary to preserve the Fifth Amendment, which protects against self-incrimination. Justice Antonin Scalia wrote a dissenting opinion and was joined by Chief Justice William Reinquist. Tuesday's decision was part of a series of rulings dealing wtih suspects' rights. The first was Miranda v. Arizona in 1966, in which the Court determined that police have to stop interrogating a criminal suspect if he requests the assistance of a lawyer. In a 1981 ruling which helped enforece Miranda, Edwards v. Arizona, the Supreme Court determined that once a suspect requests a lawyer all interrogation has to cease and can not recommence ""until counsel has been made available"" to the suspect."
Fed eases rules,
on bank funds,"As a reaction to increasing White House pressure to improve the economy, the Federal Reserve Board announced that banks will no longer be required to hold in reserve portions of deposits in cash or in interest-free balances. Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, ini tiated the move, which is intended to improve bank profits and thus to stimulate the economy. The Reserve Board accepted the propo sal in hopes that incrcaing banks' capacities to lend money will trans late into an upward shift of the economy. As a result, businesses and consumers would have more money to invest. In recent months, the Federal Reserve Board has worried about what Greenspan referred to in a Congressional testimony as a ""credit crunch,"" a tightening of bank credits. Greenspan named the credit crunch as one reason for the faltering economy. Bankers have also pressed Greenspan to make lending easier. They claimed federal regulators had reacted too harshly to the loan problems of a few banks. By over reacting, the federal regulators had created lending rcstricitions that many bankers say prevent the banks from functioning properly."
"Planes collide,",
killing eight,"A Northwest Airlines 727, trying to lift off from a slushy Detroit runway, clipped into the right engine of a McDonnell- Douglas DC-9 killing eight per sons. All eight, seven passengers and one flight attendent, were on board the DC-9 which was taxing toward another runway. Also, 22 passengers received treatment for injuries at a nearby hospital. The reason for the crash was unclear. No evidence indicated why the 727 had strayed from its run way. No officials from the Detroit Metropolitan airport would say whether the plane had been cleared for take-off. Conditions were poor and, due to fog and a morning snow storm, runways had been closed to landing planes. Visibility on the runway where the 727 had begun its take-off was a quarter mile, about one-sixth the lenghth of the runway. According to Tony Dresden, spokesman for the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, preliminary reports seemed to show that the DC-9 ""got lost"" and taxied onto the runway in front of the approaching 727. The 727, in an attempt to avoid a collision tried to take off early, but instead hit the tail of the DC-9."

Ozal advocates,
action in Gulf,"Turgut Ozal, president of Turkey, reported Tuesday that he supports the use of force in the Per sian Gulf and urged his own nation to send troops to Saudi Arabia to assist in the event of a war against Iraq. In addition, Ozal advocates allowing the United States to use an important military base in Tur key. No decision has been made by the Turkish government concern ing either issue. ""The conditions are chang ing, and if they change, we may make a decision to send troops. It is just a possibility now,"" said Turkish Prime Minister Yildirim Akbulut. Ozal's proposals came after several meetings with top officials in Washington. Ozal met with President Bush, Secretary of State James Baker, and Defense Secre tary Dick Cheney, but said he could do nothing until after the United Nations Security Council ratified the proposal to use ""all necessary means"" in dealing with Saddam Hussein. At a meeting with senior government officials Ozal pro posed increased Turkish involve ment in the crisis. Gen. Necip Torumtay, chief of the Turkish armed forces, strongly objected to Ozal's suggestions to strengthen Turkey's role in the possible war against Iraq, its neighbor to the south. Torumtay resigned from his post on Monday, apparently as a protest to Ozal's proposal. His replacement, Gen. Dogan Gures, has been in agreement with Torum tay on many past issues. The abrupt resignation drew attention to the split which still exists, between top officials, as to what action should be taken in the Persian Gulf."
Argentine,
rebels attack,
bases,"Just days before President Bush's scheduled arrival in Argen tina, several hundred army dissi dents captured the headquarters of the Argentine army and four other installations. Three people were killed in the violence which broke out early Monday morning. In answer to President Carlos Saul Menem's demand for a com plete rebel surrender, loyalist troops acted quickly to retake the installations. By evening, after continuous reverberations of auto matic weapons being fired through the capital, the loyalists declared that all was under control. After a day of combat, loyal ists said they had succeeded in retaking all sites captured by the rebel army. Loyalists took nearly 300 rebels as prisoners. It took loyalist troops two hours of intense fighting to regain the Libertador Building, in which the Argentine army headquarters are located. Fighting continued throughout the day and the pres ence of four warplanes suggested the possibility of bombing. Neither side dropped any bombs. Dissidents and loyalists con tinued sending off rounds with automatic weapons as rush hour traffic drove by the scene of the fighting. Bullets riddled the sides of cars and buses. The rebellion was the fourth staged by dissidents in the six years since Argentina formed its civilian government. Even after all the pandemo nium caused by the day's events, Bush still made the trip to Argen tina. On Wednesday night, he stayed in the residence of the American ambassador."
Germans elect,
Kohl s coalition,"In the first free election since 1932, the people of a united Ger many endorsed Chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition. Kohl is the leader of the Christian Democratic Party. Results of the parliamentary elections seem to indicate an endorsement of the German unifi cation. The newly elected leader ship is nearly the same as the administration of West Germany during the tearing down of the Ber lin Wall in November 1989. Election results showed that the Christian Democrats won 44.7 percent of the votes. Still short of a majority, Kohl's party will have to form a coalition. As was anticipated, the par ties which opposed German unifi cation fared poorly at the polls. Computer projections gave the Social Democrats only 33.5 percent of the votes. The Free Democratic Party received 11 percent and the Party of Democratic Socialism managed to win 9.4 percent of the vote, enough to secure 14 seats in Parliament."
Police fine TKE,
for violations,"Tau Kappa Epsilon Fraternity received fines of $1000 for provid ing minors with alcohol and $300 for a count of disorderly conduct in an September incident. The fines came after fraternity president Marie Roessler pleaded guilty to the offenses. In addition to the fines, set by District Justice Leo S. Armbruster, the fraternity will be on probation for a year. The charges came after three fraternity members agreed, at a pre liminary hearing, to testify that the fraternity had furnished alcohol for three minors present at a party at 38 South Fifth Street Lewisburg police filed charges against Roessler on November 2. Lewisburg police also charged each of the three--Stephen Casey '91, David Gutheil '91, and Brandon Poe '91--with one count of furnishing minors with alcohol and one count of disorderly conduct. The names of the two minors involved in the incident did not appear on the affidavit to Arm bruster. The two minors had been arrested and admitted to consuming alcohol at the September 15 party. Police dropped a second count against the fraternity for fur nishing alcohol to a minor."
Panhel sponsors,

According to the Panhcllcnic Council, the study session was ""a true indication of the academic motivation that really docs exist among sororities."" The purpose of the study session was to promote academic awareness. The session lasted three hours and included a short break to allow for interaction between members of different sororities."
Protesters print,
fake newspaper,"An anti-war statement sent the campus of the State University of New York (SUNY) at Bingham ton into turmoil Wednesday, when a group of students issued a fake edition of the campus newspaper with front page headlines proclaim ing that the United States had invaded Iraq and that SUNY stu dents had been drafted. Members of a radical student group, Looking Left, used the for mat of Pipe Dream, the student newspaper published twice weekly. Headlines which read ""U.S. Invades Iraq"" and ""SUNY Bin ghamton Students Drafted"" shocked students and staff who believed the nation had indeed gone to war. Both articles ended with dis claimers which read, ""The events described above have not hap pened. Yet. But they may."" Still, students and staff overlooked these disclaimers and embraced the real ity of war. Based on information from ihe bogus newspaper, the college radio station broadcast news that the nation had entered into war with Iraq. David L. Anderson, acting vice president for student affairs, was appalled by the incident. any students do rely on their stu dent newpaper for current events. And many reacted to how legiti mate it appeared. It looked just like the Pipe Dream,"" he said. After the incident, the univer sity distibuted 4000 fliers inform ing students that the United States was not at war and that the Pipe Dream was not responsible for the issue. Pipe Dream intends to sue members of Looking Left"

SAMS--,"From page 1 period, SAMS will give away hundreds of donated prizes. ""We're going to give away approximately 20 an hour,"" said Krakoff. Each of the more than 500 prizes are donations from individ uals, organizations and busi nesses. Trustee Ken Langone, '37, donated two tickets each to Florida and California. The Buck- nell Bookstore donated some of its merchandise, and many of the merchants of Lewisburg also con tributed items to be given away as door prizes. National organizations, too, contributed to the cause. Disney land donated two admission tick ets, L..A. Gear donated two pairs of shoes, and The Gap donated a $35 gift certificate. Several organizations con tributed money to help SAMS get the project off the ground. BSG appropriated $313 to SAMS. The $399 from Committee on Student Programming went to printing posters. The Interfratemity Coun cil and the Residence Hall Associ ation also contributed money. Organizers of the dance decided on a point system to determine the winning organiza tion. The total money a group earns will be divided by the num ber of organization members and multiplied by 100. An organiza tion will gain 10 points for every hour a member dances and will lose 20 points for every hour in which no one dances. Bonus points will be awarded for every person in a group who dances the entire 24 hours. Groups will gain points based on the number of stu dents and faculty who come for support. The group with the best theme hour will win 100 points. Teams that win contests during different theme hours will also be awarded points. Students not registered on a tag team will find other types of entertainment Bucknell Activities Council (BAC) has rented a large foot piano, similar to the one in ""BIG."" SAMS will charge stu dents 50 cents to play a tune, and for two dollars students can record a song in a sound record ing booth rented by the Bison Pro gramming Committee. As students dance and par ticipate in other activities, mem bers of Amnesty Intemaional will write letters in support of increased funding for"
MS,"research. Dancers also will be given plenty of food breaks. Some of the organizations hosting theme hours will provide food. In addi tion, area food businesses have provided food for both dancers and workers. Throughout the dance, beginning at midnight and contin uing until dinner at 5 p.m. Satur day, food breaks will come approximately every four hours. The first break will include pizza, ice cream, and cookies sponsored by Domino's Pizza, Lickety Split, and McDonald's. Area food chains will also provide food for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. In conjunction with their theme hours, the Bison Volun teers will provide sundaes at 4 a.m., and BAC will sponsor a popcorn break at 8 a.m. Students who are not danc ing will be able to buy food at the Bison, which has agreed to remain open for all 24 hours. According to Krakoff, once it seemed like most students were willing to participate in the dance, the committee switched its focus to faculty and administration. Both the Division of Student Life and the biology department signed up tag teams. The faculty challenge hour has been set up to encourage members of depart ments to participate in the event. The department which has the greatest percent of its constitu ency present will be treated to a brunch the following day. In addition to faculty, and members of the SAMS steering committee will attend the lunch eon. ""Basically it's just a nice way of saying thank you. It's a nice way to bring the students and faculty together,"" said Jen Hunt, '93, a member of the committee. Wendy Shaver, '92, co chair of the Dance-for-a-Chance committee, presented the idea to SAMS after seeing a similar dance marathon at Penn State. ""I was amazed by how much it brought their campus together,"" she said. The program at Penn State lasted 48 hours and raised $650,000. ""We knew that based on our size, we would never get that much,"" said Krakoff. SAMS has invited people with MS, a disease which usually first shows up in college students, to come to the dance during the SAMS theme hour, from 11 a.m. to noon tomorrow. ____________________________ y"

Trustees,"From page 1 approved by the trustees on Satur day morning."" Idlcman clarified the position of the majority of the trustees say ing, ""There were two basic con cerns, the falling pool of applicants and the economic tumble. The question is how deep or how long the downturn will last. We have approved every budget that I can remember."" In discussing the rationality behind the trustee decision. Max well said, 'Their [the trustees'] concern is that all other schools on the list are pricing themselves at too high a level and will end up having difficulty in the future. That was the view not of all the trustees but of a significant number of trustees."" Maxwell also mentioned that the lower increase in the compre hensive fee should be viewed as a one-year aberration caused by a concern on the part of the trustees over the state of the economy. He emphasized that this is not a trajec tory course for the University. Micheal Moohr, associate professor of economics, claimed that the finance committee's propo sal to cut the proposed budget makes the goal of reducing the stu- dent-to-faeulty ratio more difficult to achieve. Moohr did say, ""We still plan to add about three faculty positions for the academic year '91-92, instead of the five we wanted."" Moohr said, 'The finance committee has proposed a rate increase of 4.5 percent which they believe will be the rate of inflation in fiscal '91-92. Currently, inflation is running at about 6.5 percent."" According to Moohr, the disparity in the two estimates of the inflation"
Budgetary process,
proves to be complex,"By Travis Elliot Staff Writer The budgetary process begins in the fall semester with the planning and budget committee. The planning and budget committee examines a variety of budget scenarios and tradeoffs. They make a recommendation to the office of the president. The planning and budget committee makes a recommendation for major revenue options which are tuition, room and board, and they also make a recommendation about the major expendi tures such as salaries or increases in faculty or staff. Those are the major guidelines that are recommended to the office of the president. In most instances the office of the president accepts that budget proposal. The office of the president then makes a recommendation to the trustees though the trustee budget committee, and that budget committee makes its recommendation to the finance committee. It is the finance committee that makes the final recommendation to the board of trustees. rates would imply a real cut equal to two percent. Furthermore, in a memoran dum to the members of the plan ning and budget committee, Moohr stressed the difference between the Consumer Price Index and the Higher Education Price Index. Moohr noted that the types of goods purchased by the average consumer are not the same type of goods that arc purchased by higher education institutions. In a letter to the faculty, Larry Shinn, vice president for aca demic affairs, wrote, ""Since the Trustee's mandate refers to the comprehensive fee only, the faculty and staff salary increase should still be above 5 percent even with the 4.5 percent comprehensive fee limi tation. While there is no formal agreement with the Board on fixing comprehensive fees, there are agreed-upon guidelines for begin ning to fix salaries and wages. While we may not be able to meet the original target (6.2 percent), we will make every effort to come as close as possible."" Idclman said, ""We [the trus tees] have a responsibility to keep the institution solvent and viable. Should this be a serious economic downturn, this may be a prudent step on behalf of the trustees."" Moohr said, ""It is amazing that we arc able to remain competi tive with these institutions given our poor endowment and lower comprehensive fee."" Sojka wrote, ""In my conclud ing comments at the Board meet ing, I made it quite clear that I was disappointed at the Board's deci sion and that I considered the action on the budget to be a mistake."""

to support local charities,"By Jen Marshall Staff Writer Quick! What's the most com monly occurring crime in this coun try? Contrary to popular belief, masked villains aren't busy stealing cars or evading taxes. Sadly, the number of women beaten every day far exceeds the rate of any other crime in the United States. Accord ing to the FBI. a woman is beaten every eighteen seconds. Six million women are severely beaten by their spouses each year, and fifteen hun dred of those women die. To depress you even further, did you know that one out of every 3 - 4 girls and one out of every 6 - 10 boys will be sexually abused before the age of eighteen? Women and children are constant targets for crimes of physical and sexual abuse. Almost everyone feels sorry for the victims of these unspeaka ble crimes, but often action is left"
The Collegiate,
Perspective,
(and other fairy tales),"By Peter Lalos Staff Writer Under the most recently- added section of Bucknell Uni versity's academic core require ment handbook (part 5, article IV, sub-section F), each student currently enrolled at the institu tion will be required to requalify for admission by passing a com prehensive examination covering information of which the admin istration, faculty, and board of trustees believes every student should be aware. This ordinance, effective beginning in the fall 1990 semester, postulates that only a perfect score on this exam will qualify students for readmit tance to the university for the fol lowing year. Testing time: 20 minutes Number of questions: 6 1) Bucknell University's motto is w hich of the following? a) ""For SI8,000 a year, yer damn right I can do anything I want!"" b ) ""Universitas Bucnellensis Magna Constructionesis et Tui- tionas Squirelles Bubble ns is."" c) ""Bucknell University-- It's not quite ivy, but OOH! Is it ever close !"" d) ""I may disagree with what beer you drink, but 1 will fight to the death for your right to drink it."" e) ""All of the above."" 2) What is the most com mon grievance of the univer sity's student body? a) Why does every floor in the University Center have rest rooms on them except that which contains the cafeteria, which hap pens to be the level that needs them the most? b) If operating microwave ovens in dormitories is consid ered illegal by the university, then why does the Bison sell microwave food? Can you say, ""Conflict of interests""? c) The administration drinks entirely too much alcohol. d) The layout of the aca demic quadrangle's sidewalks defies all conventional logic. e) Some of the above. 3) BucknelPs ""best kept secret"" is: a) If you average the times of both clocks in the Bostwick cafeteria, you will get the correct time. b) The network of tunnels running underneath the campus of Bucknell University were actu ally created by a federally- commissioned panel of scientists in order to create a habitat for a bitchin' game of ""Lazer Tag."" c) The administration and faculty are here to help us. d) A and C. e) B, C, not A, and con ceivably D. 4) The most commonly- confronted classroom mystery is w hich of the follow ing? a) Why do you always learn so much about the incorrect theories in an academic disci pline as opposed to the correct ones? b) Why do those schleps who cut 97% of the semester's classes come in on exam days and ace the tests, while you sweat blood studying for them and barely scrape out a ""C""? Did these guys make a pact with the devil or something? c) Whatever happened to recess? d) Shouldn't we aim for a little more ethnic and cultural diversity in our student body before we try to achieve it in our curriculum? e) All of the below. 5) The near-riot by Bucknell students on the night of Octo ber 31, 1990, was: a) Something to tell your children about. b) An excellent opportunity to drastically improve college community relations. c) A dream come true for ace local newscaster Nolan Johannes. d) A complete embarrass ment for everyone involved. e) .""Nolan Johannes."" Doesn't that name just roll off your longue? Say it with me. Just once. ""Nolan Johannes."" 6) The number ""7"" represents w hich of the follow ing? a) The number of Bucknell students who have yet to steal an eating utensil from the cafeteria. b) The percentage of What's Happening flyers which aren't immediately thrown away before a student moves ten feet from his/her mailbox. c) The number of soda machines that are out of order on any given day in the cafeteria. d) The number of addi tional parking spaces that have been installed on Bucknell's campus since World War II. e) None of the middle. Extra Credit: Locate the United States of America on an unmarked world map (Don't laugh-- it's apparently more dif ficult than many people think. In fact, I bet one out of every seven of you miss it). When you have completed this examination and have turned it in to the registrar's office, you may leave the campus for the semester. Have a great break, everyone. up to the enforcers of the law and state-run social programs. This year, however, the business people of the Northumberland and Union counties are taking matters into their own hands. How did I happen to find out about this? Well, one day about two weeks ago, I was at the hairdresser's... Nothing exciting ever hap pens while sitting in a swivel chair, finally getting that mop of hair on your head trimmed, right? (We're not counting scissors that have accidentally slipped or perms that have turned your hair a lovely shade of olive green.) Well, at the Joseph Carroll Salon on Market Street in good old Lewisburg, I actually discovered a pretty admira ble cause that the local merchants are supporting. On December 9, 1990. the Joseph Carroll Salon will be one of the salons hosting the first annual ""Santa's Snippers"" day. If you think that ""Santa's Snippers"" is just some corny idea hatched by the residents of Lewisburg, read on. ""Santa's Snippers"" is so worth while that Governor Casey has declared December 9th to be ""Santa's Snippers"" day throughout all of Pennsylvania. So just what are these ""Snippers,"" and what do they have to do with battered women and children? From 12:00 to 6:00 pm on December 9th. many of the hair salons in the Susquehanna Valley will be having a special price on haircuts - just ten dollars! But wait, that's not the good part! Every penny of that ten dollars that you turn over for your new 'do goes to the Susquehanna Valley Women in Transition Organization. This organization sponsors services to help abused women and children. Not only are hairdressers lending their services, but local merchants are donating items to be sold or raf fled. Baked goods, (Yes! REAL cookies and brownies!) will also be sold. So, anyone going down to Joseph Carroll Salon on December 9th could get a new look, buy a Christmas present for mom, and pig out on cookies. Every dollar of profit will be given to the charity, as all administrative services were donated. Speaking of administrative services, the owners of the Joseph Carroll Salon, Joe (surprise, sur prise!), and his wife Gail are the chair people of the Northumberland and Union county ""Santa's Snip pers."" When asked what motivated her to put in the enormous effort it took to coordinate the event, Gail Carroll said that she felt very sad about the fact that so many children are abused. In the Susquehanna Valley region, fifty-two new cases"

Through ""Santa's Snip pers"", Gail feels that she can help these children begin new and better lives. Obviously, others feel the same way. Sitting on Gail Carroll's reception desk is a donation can for the Women in Transition center, and I noticed more than one cus tomer stuffing money into the already full can. One thousand dol- lars has been raised from these cans alone, and the local Kiwanis Club has donated five hundred dol lars to the cause. It's nice to know that people care about more than just themselves or their new hair style. ""Santa's Snippers"", along with the Carrolls, have gone a long way in proving that ordinary peo ple can help solve women and chil dren's worst nightmare."
Making campus Christmas wreaths,"By Claire Davidson Staff Writer For the past three years a group of volunteers have gotten together over Thanksgiving break to make the Christmas wreaths dis played around campus. This year Art Moser, Sandy Sojka, Chris Lena Jarreu and her son, Joanne Powell and Janet Murray spent the Friday and Saturday after Thanksgiving puuing them together. Initially, the Power Plant gets the greens used to make the wreaths from the nursery on cam pus. Art Moser, the head of the mail room commented, ""They get a good variety of sprouse, holly, Aus tralia pine, hemlock and the white pine."" Mr. Moser also emphasized the importance of the Power Plant in this project. In addition to get ting the supplies, they are in charge of hanging them around campus and taking them down after the holidays. For the campus there is virtu ally no cost for the greens since they get them from the campus nur sery. Also some of the supplies, such as the bows are reused each year. The people who make these wreaths have donated their time to Bucknell. ""They really put their hearts into it,"" commented Mr. Moser. Mrs. Sojka came up with the Allison Zadroga/The Bucknellian Those people who donated their time to make the Christmas wreaths currently decorating the campus are from left, Janet Murray, Christena Jarrett, Art Moser, Sandy Sojka, Joanne Powell, and Zach Jarrett (9 ' years old) who is not pictured. idea to make the wreaths and got the project off the ground. She asked Mr. Moser to help make them since she knew he had experi ence. ""I enjoy working with the greens to make the wreaths at Christmas time,"" he explained. He also has his own business on the side, in which he makes approxi mately 50 wreaths a year for peo ple's doors. Mr. Moser and the other vol unteers want to expand the amount of participation in this project. Each year we arc hoping to ge more people involved in makinj the wreaths. We want to make i into a kind of campus project,"" hi explained."

A  very merry,
Bison Tales,"By Marc Haimes Staff Writer Lights, gifts, sleigh-bells...baaah, Humbug...maybe you peo ple who attend different universities that let out at normal times have nothing better to do than sing about Reindeers with physical defor mities, but I've got exams to take. So stay out of my way or I'll tell Santa to fill your stocking with ""New Bison"" propaganda pins, or maybe I'll inform Prancer about that Venison you had last month and suggest that he leave you a little surprise in your egg nog. Ahem...Sorry, I wasn't always this much of a cutthroat; I think it's the general atmosphere around here. Everyone seems to be walking around in sweat-pants or jeans (standard exam-time attire) and mumbling about how ""stressed"" they arc. Just yesterday, as 1 entered the library behind a spectacled student who was grimacing under the weight of his bulging back-pack, I politely smiled and quipped, ""Guess you've got a few books to read...ha ha."" But the guy just looked at me like I was a used Q-tip and proceeded to bel ligerently flip the metal entry-bar forcefully back into my hips while he made a break for the study carrels on the top floor. The Mac lab has also been taken over by jcan-clad study- slaves, frantically typing out their ten-page papers (that arc due in 45 minutes) while isolating themselves behind their blaring Walkmans and cursing violently when their Applcsharc ""Chooser"" doesn't work. Meanwhile, all the lab late-comcrs, who were not quick enough to secure a computer, hover around wailing for that little whirring sound (which means that a disk is being ejected and some one might be leaving) so that they can dash across the room and claim their prize. Actually, the preceding scenario would be an ideal setting for one of those psychedelic Levi's Jeans commercials where a button- fly-wearing student speaks frankly to the camera while a mournful harmonica sounds in the background... Hi, My name's Dan and I love to party with my pals. But when study-time comes around 1 get serious and slip into my good ol' 501's. They're real comfortable, and their unique button-fly design gives me extra flexibility to beat unfriendly students away from the computers with my disk drive. Heh, Heh. The idea would be straight-forward and easy to understand; the way commercials were when we were kids. Back then it was an understood fact that since everybody's idol...Michael Jackson, drinks Pepsi, we should all drink it too. Of course, following that logic we also should have had several million dollars of cosmetic surgery and blown up our hair in public. It was also a known fact that all fun-loving and carefree people drove Suzuki Samurais. In fact, anyone who didn't drive a Samurai was considered an uptight looser with the sexual appeal of a month-old urine specimen who the Suzuki drivers would point and laugh at...until they tried to apply the brake and found themselves flipping uncontrollably into a gravel pit. But nowadays commercials arc impossible to understand. Like the ad for Levi's 505's with the incredibly stupid looking guy whose great claim to fame is that that he can talk backwards. Somehow I find it really hard to picture a consumer watching that particular commercial and saying, ""Oh Wow!!! That really cool guy who TALKS BACKWARDS is wearing 505's...I better run out and get a pair right now!"" No. This would not happen. . . Especially since it has been proven that men who have traded in their 505's for Bugle Boy brand jeans will in fact, randomly meet beautiful women who drive up to them in red convertible sports cars, stare at their crotch, and drive away. Alright, I probably should stop discussing commercials, because I'm beginning to get really frustrated. In fact, I don't think I have been so annoyed since last year around this same time. I was trying to get some decent sleep the night before my 8 a.m. econom ics final, when I was awakened at 3:30 in the morning by the enthu siastic retching of a few of my hallmates. They had already finished all of their exams and immediately set out to obliterate any tiny elec trons of knowledge that still might be clinging to their brain cells; arriving back at the dorm just in time to purge themselves in our lounge (located directly across from my room). I managed to ignore the pungent scent drifting under the door and was on my way back to sleep until someone, who had evidently been sorting through the appetizing puddle shouted, ""Hey! 1 just found an onion!!! Did you eat a quarter-pounder or something?!?"" After inspecting their discov ery and deciding that it really was an onion, my hallmates then agreed that 4:00 in the morning would be a perfect time for a rousing game of Indoor Lacrosse. With the loser having to walk barefoot through...I'm sure you get the idea. The next morning, after struggling through my 3-hour test, I headed back to the room to pack my things. I thought I had placed the previous night's ordeal behind me, but I guess my lack of sleep had mutated my ordinarily kind disposition...When I spotted ""Onion-man"" (his new nick-name) heading towards the showers 1 silently followed him and waited cautiously outside the door. Then, just when his shampoo should have been developing into a thick eye-threatening lather, I bust into the bathroom and simultaneously flushed all four commodes giving him a scalding surprize. ""YRREM SAMTSIRHC"" I shouted as I bolted out the door superfast in my form-fitting 505's. And A Happy WEN RAEY! s. ___________________ _ _____________________________________ S eekin g Sales-oriented individual to represent our sportswear com pany in Greek and U niversity market selling top of the line products that are alw ays w ell received.

Behind the scenes in the bookstore,
...,
Buying and selling textbooks,"By Lisa Lipari Staff Writer As the end of the semester approaches, many students are pre paring for finals and arc looking forward to the holiday season. It is also a time when many students spend a little more money than usual and the extra money obtained from selling back textbooks really comes in handy. Marlene Wertz, textbook buyer at the our bookstore is also preparing for next semester's stock. Wertz, who has been with the bookstore for 11 years, said that, on the average, about 1500 titles are ordered per semester. These books arc ordered from several places, including eight wholesale distribu tors (who deal with used books) and several publishers (who sell new books). When books arc requested by professors for the following semes ter, Wertz checks the stockroom here first. She then calls the whole salers and asks them to hold the number of books that arc still needed. After the student buyback period at Bucknell, Wertz then calls the wholesaler again and either orders more books or tells them to cancel the order, depending upon how many books were sold back to the bookstore. If a wholesaler does not have a certain title, it will be ordered through the publisher. However, because of the rising cost of new textbooks, Wertz said that she tries to order as many used text books as possible, even though it's more time consuming. Although many students may not believe it, the average cost of textbooks per student per year is $363.44, which is 2.07% of a Peter Ho/The Bucknellian Marlene Wertz, Textbook Buyer, has worked at the bookstore for 11 years. year's tuition. At buyback, stu dents can get, at most, 50% of the current retail price. However, this is not always the case. If a profes sor doesn't request that edition for another semester, or if he or she"
Every little bit helps...,
Using recycled products on cam,
pus aids world trash problems,"By Christine Phillips Why has recycling suddenly become a major issue in America? Perhaps because the fact that we arc running out of places to put our garbage has finally slapped us right in the face. By the year 1991, half of the landfills in the nation will close, and almost no one wants a new one built in his or her proverbial (or lit eral) backyard. The average Ameri can generates 3.5 pounds of gar bage every day. That's 160 million tons per year nationally. Total U.S. waste pro duction per person is double that of any other country in the world. A great deal of what goes into landfills is paper--almost 40%. If half of just the newsprint that is thrown away every year in the United States were recycled, six million tons of waste (that's 3200 garbage trucks every day) would not have to be put into landfills. If the 20 million tons of waste paper that was recycled in 1989 had been sent to a landfill instead, it would have taken up an area of six square miles by ten feet deep. Many people assume that paper which is put into landfills will degrade after a couple of years, but this is not the case. Enough oxygen is not present in the fills to support the microorganisms which break the paper down. Pqper that has been in landfills for 15 years has been found intact and often readable. This doesn't mean that every one should just fling paper across the countryside because it has a bet ter chance of degrading in the open air, but should think seriously about where the paper thrown away is going. It does matter if that paper ends up in the recycling bin. Aside from the whole landfill space saving reason, recycling just one ton of paper also: --keeps 60 lbs. of pollution from entering the air --saves 17 trees --saves 7000 gallons of water --creates five times as many jobs as producing paper from virgin wool pulp. Bucknell is doing its part to promote the recycling of paper. Not only do we recy cle, but students, faculty, and staff also buy recycled paper products as well. According to Jim Muchler of Administrative Services, approximately 30% of the paper that is purchased for use on campus by them contains recycled fiber. For the past year, various types of recycled paper also have been tested for the copy machines. Copy paper makes up a large amount of the campus demand. So far none of the recycled alternatives have worked very well. Apparently, the recycled paper is not as crisp as paper make from virgin fiber, and it jams the machines. Once an accept able brand is found, however, the amount of recycled paper being used on campus should jump to 70%! Even the bookstore has begun to order more recycled paper prod ucts--stationery, cards, and wrap ping paper. Many others will be available starting next semester. Perhaps with Bucknell's continued recycling efforts, that 160 million tons of garbage per year will be reduced in the years to come."

742-7978,"simply didn't return in the requisi tion form by the deadline (May 1st for the fall semester, November 10 for the spring), then the bookstore can only offer the wholesaler's value. Wertz suggests checking throughout the week if a requisi tion has not been returned. ""It comes at a bad time for [the profes sors], but it is necessary for us to get the information as early as pos sible for the students' benefit."" Wertz also said that many students are confused when they see the signs posted for 50% buy back rate on books and don't receive this amount. For this rea son, Wertz posts the bookstore's policy for buyback, and the buy back book is updated daily to include any requisitions that come in. Most books can be sold back to the bookstore, unless they arc lab workbooks with the answers writ ten in ink or if the book has tcar- out pages. The condition of the book docs not matter (unless it is very badly shclf-wom), and Wertz said that writing in texts or high lighting is okay. Students have the option to hold a book and sell it the follow ing semester for a better rate. For example, if a course is only offered in the fall, the text used will proba bly not be requested for the spring semester. Therefore, it would be more beneficial to wail a semester and sco if it is requested again for the fall. (The student would then receive the 50% the buyback rate.) Even if it is not requested, the stu dent can always sell it for the wholesale value they would have received anyway. However, most students don't want to wait and would rather have the money right away. Wertz pointed out that if the copyright date of the text is old, the student may want to sell it as soon as possible, because the text could very well be replaced with a newer edition. As for returning newly pur chased books at the beginning of a semester, students have the first two weeks to do so. Wertz said that the date is always posted, and that there is a three to four day grace period. (Students must have their receipt to return books.) Wertz feels that the system works well for both the students' and the professors' benefit. She said that she understands that the books are a large expense, and because of this she tries hard to get the best value for the students. She also tries hard to honor the requests of each professor and to obtain for them the books they need. So if you have any questions, go to the bookstore and ask! And when you're selling your books back, remember read the signs!"
Dear Wanda,"Dear Wanda, I don't have any money left--what should I do about holiday gifts? I don't think I can afford presents for my fam ily this year, much less for my friends! Running on Fumes Dear R.O.F., I doubt that you really need any additional stress during this wonderful time of the semester. Don't worry about gifts. First of all, I'm sure the vast majority of your friends are in the same posi tion money-wise. Talk to them about it - many of the people 1 know have a policy of not exchanging gifts with friends because they arc all impoverished college students. If you feel that you must get something for them, keep it simple. Friends here would probably love something to munch on while studying for finals. Bake cookies and put them on holiday plates, fill a mug with candy, etc. Your friends at home will feel the same - no matter how cheesy it sounds, it is the thought that counts. If you put some lime and effort into a gift, the cost is irrelevant. Family presents arc gener ally more mandatory. Try going in with a brother or sister for a parent's gift. If you feel you must do it alone, you still have options. The time/cffort/love more than expense rule is even more true for family. Even when you were in third grade didn't your parents still like the handmade presents best? Or maybe they just pre tended for your sake. But really, they know you don't have a lot of money and they won't expect elaborate gifts. In terms of money - remember that you'll be selling books back and may get some cash from that. You can always ^put off the payment by charging gifts in the Bookstore. Don't worry about spending a lot on their presents - your family will most likely let you stick around even if you get them all plastic lint removers. Dear Wanda, I'm a freshman and I don't know whether to rush next semester. What should I do? To Rush or Not to Rush... Dear T.R.o.N.t.R., Chances are that you will be feeling pressure both ways in this situation. You should not join a Greek organization because you feel pressure. Many freshmen join for this reason and end up feeling uncomfortable with their decision. I do feci that you should go through rush, just to see what Greek life is like. Rush is a great way to meet upperclassmen, as well as other freshmen. The most important advice, though, is to go with your gut feelings. You should not join a fraternity or sorority just because all of your friends are and you fear being left behind. Your true friends will be your friends no matter what. If you meet people in a fraternity or sorority that you really like, you may think of joining. If you don't feel comfortable with any partic ular organization, there is no rea son to join. Right now, Greek life seems like the be all and end all at Bucknell. Joining a fraternity or a sorority can be a great way to meet people, but if you decide it is not for you, there are always other social organizations that you can join. Most importantly, don't take the whole process too seriously. Have fun and remem ber, if you are honest with your self, everything will work out for the best."

Growth or decay?,
Fee hike would be positive...,"It is ironic that the trustees' attempt to improve the competitiveness of Bucknell has actually become a first step toward decay. The trustees maintain that exceeding a 4.5% increase in comprehensive fees would adversely affect Bucknell's ability to compete in a tight market. On the contrary, lower revenues will yield a decline in the quality of this University and its number of applicants. For an institution which has a relatively poor endowment and relies largely on tuition income for operating expenses, Bucknell cannot afford to forego a possible increase in the comprehensive fee. It represents a loss in potential revenues which can never be made up. The administration describes the proposed increase, the lowest budget increase in 25 years, as a one-year aberration that does not represent a new trajectory course for the University. We can only hope so. If the trustees find it appropriate to continue on this same path, Bucknell will eventually fall into the category of stagnant, declining Universities. Of course, a demographics argument has some merit. The more that the comprehensive fee is increased, the more difficult it becomes for Bucknell to attract a group of students with a diverse economic background. This must not be a deterrent to increasing the comprehensive fee; rather, the focus must be shifted to the University's endowment and financial aid capabilities. Indeed, the long-term solution to the problems of economic diversity and competitiveness centers around the need to increase the University's endowment. In comparison to the frame of reference schools, Bucknell's endowment is one of the lowest. With a relatively larger endowment, not only could economic diversity be pro moted, but the annual budgets could reflect the expansion necessary to maintain quality education without rela tively high increases in the comprehensive fee. In deciding to keep next year's rate of increase in the comprehensive fee tied to inflation's rate of increase, the trustees have made a serious flaw. An increase of 4.5 percent will most likely fall short of the rate of inflation. With the crisis in the Persian Gulf, high oil prices threaten to keep inflation high despite the impending recession. In fact, inflation has already reached 6.5 percent, which would suggest that the trustees are really proposing a real cut in comprehensive fees of 2 percent. In the past, increases in the comprehensive fee exceeding the rate of inflation have aided such accomplish ments as the building of the Wies Center, the creation of the computer science department, and the retention of prominent faculty members. Now is no time for stagnation. To maintain and improve on Bucknell's long standing tradition of academic excellence will require courageous leadership--perhaps the lions on the finance committee should vacation in Oz."
Bucknell's in the spotlight,
And we're looking bad...,"In the December 3 USA Today article comparing crime statistics from Pennsylvania colleges, Bucknell received the highest crime index rate per capita. This fact sheds a very disturbing light on the reporting of USA Today as well as on Bucknell's certain increase in small crime. It was naive for USA Today to believe it could compare uni versities from all over Pennsylvania and develop a just formula by which to create its index. Crime reporting varies extensively from college to college in the Commonwealth, and it is very unlikely that any uniformity of reporting could be achieved. Further, most of Bucknell's so-called frame-of-reference schools did not participate in the survey. How, then, can we compare to larger, public universities in far more metropolitan areas? Not very well, it appears. So why are there so many criminal incidents per student anyway? Small crime appears to be the answer. Bucknell is plagued with small-time vandals, petty thieves and 'wacky funsters' who prey on the trusting, close-knit community we call home. And thanks to the article in USA Today, Buck nell is finally going to receive the publicity it deserves. Until the University finds a way to curb campus crime, albeit small-time, it will have to live with its reputation. Speaking of reputation: the Trustees believe that Bucknell needs to increase its competitiveness. Surely, this will help."

Junior expresses rage at stealing,To the Editor:
WHAT THE HELL WENT ON AT LAMBDA,"CHI LAST FRIDAY NIGHT?!!!!! Was there an unannounced five finger sale? I, along with an alleged seven others, returned to the coat room a little too late. My coat had been stolen!! Yes people, it's called STEALING, not ,'Tm  cold, so what the hell, here's a jacket so I think I'll borrow it."" I am one bitter, dis gusted Bucknellian. Better yet, don't even call me a Bucknellian--I would rather not be associated with the kind of rich, spoiled trash that would dare to steal. Admittedly, not everyone fits this category. However, as I write this, it's hard to imagine that decent human beings actually exist here. Trust went out the window, and let's just say that right now, I'd even be suspi cious of Mother Theresa. What kind of people are you? What kind of families do you come from? I falsely assumed that Bucknell was free of deceitful THIEVES. (Yes, thieves. I'm hoping that by the end of this letter you'll realize what you are, and that you're no better than hoodlums on the street. Some of them steal to sur vive. Why do you?) As you took our coats you proba bly thought, ""Oh, well, they'll never miss it, mummy and daddy will buy them another one."" BULLS--T!.M Most people I know struggle to be here. Ironically, the people who stole my jacket, and others', probably need what they took least Worst of all, they most likely think nothing of it. You have no idea just how much you stole that night. In my case, for instance, you took my ID, my room key, and most importantly, my car keys. Unfortunately, my key chain identified the car I own. Needless to say, I no longer feel safe having my car on campus. (You'd probably steal my car, too, just for kicks.) The car is no longer here, but before I bring it back I will have to replace all the locks. A six to seven hundred dollar ordeal for me, just because you were cold. You make me sick!!! Some of you may wonder why I brought my coat to a fraternity. Well, when it's 31 degrees out side, I think you'd wear a coat, too. (Except for the scum that picks one up along the way...) When you see a sign reading ""Coat Room"" and walk in to find hundreds of coats lying around, you assume that all is safe. I, along with at least seven others were wrong!!! (Last time I checked the sign ""Coat Room"" didn't translate to, ""Come on in and help yourself!"".) What more can I say? If this were a bad sec tion of a large city I would never have let my jacket leave my hands. Trusting the apparently secure Bucknell campus was a mistake. To the person who has my jacket: If you don't have the decency to give it back, at least have the decency to return my ID and car keys. Thanks for nothing, Andreea M. Georgiu '92"
S.T.O.P. explains purpose on campus,"To the Editor: S.T.O.P. (Students and Teachers Organized for Peace) is a new organization on campus that has become very vocal regarding the use of military force in the Per sian Gulf crisis. This brief article is written for the sole purpose of clari fying the many misconceptions on campus about our group. S.T.O.P. is against any use of military action against Iraq and wants to encourage people to con sider non-military solutions to the conflict. We do not, by any means, condone the actions of Sadaam Hussein in invading Kuwait, but we do not think that the President's policy regarding force is justified. We encourage people to become educated on the subject from sev eral different sources and consider the results of such a military con flict both on us and on the people in the Persian Gulf. Do we really have the right to harm a group of inno cent people who have been them selves pawns of Hussein's aggres sive policy? And why should the United States provide 81% of the ""United Nations force"" when actu ally Japan and Europe get more of their oil from Iraq than we do? Darren Shaw, in the Novem ber 30 edition of The Bucknellian, remarked on a few points he felt were wrong with S.T.O.P.'s posi tion. We would like to comment on these because we feel they are points that the whole campus is unclear on as well. First, Mr. Shaw points out that those who have died See S.T.O.P., page 9"
Alumna reminds BU of its merits,"To Current Bucknellians: In the height of reforms and changes, it has been made aware to the alumni that a very low morale exists at Bucknell. As I returned to New Jersey after Homecoming weekend, I was reading The Buck nellian, and I was shocked to dis cover that there is much discontent and disagreement with administra tion's attempt to reform the social code. I am not writing this letter to comment on these social changes, I am writing this letter to remind you of what you do have at Bucknell. I work in a small private school in which we are greatly lacking in both facilities and money. As I arrived on the Buck nell campus last Saturday morning, I was overwhelmed by its beauty and solitude. I once again realized how fortunate I was to spend four years dh a campus which offered the finest library, field house, living conditions, academic buildings, arts center and university center. As construction continues, both the architecture and beauty are pre served while the new buildings offer more modem and updated facilities. While I work in this small, modest, private school, I remember and appreciate the magnificent facilities (not to mention the out standing faculty) I had access to at Bucknell. Not only do I urge you to appreciate this fine institution, but I thank you all for hosting a great Homecoming weekend. Linda Van Deusen '88 November 17,1990"

Alumnus encourages,
S.T.O.P.'s anti-war efforts,"To the Editor: In ancient Japan bloody bat tles were preceded by (1) a series of ferocious scowls, (2) an exchange of spiteful insults, (3) a shouting of threats, (4) a flourish ing and clashing of weapons. With ""Imminent Thunder,"" we have reached at least that point. On the evening of November 18 this BU alumnus listened with approval as a major TV network reported that campus opposition is building against our national ""lead ers'"" witless brinkmanship. A specific campus came on screen. Harvard? No. UCLA? No. ""A relatively conservative college in Pennsylvania--Bucknell University."" As announcement of a sec ond invitation to the Orange Bowl--where the Orange and Blue prevailed in its initial post-season contest--would have been thrill ing. Not THIS thrilling. Bravo, Bucknell men and women! You arc in the national spotlight. You can exert national leadership. You can make history. When you mount the demon strations for peace which this Old Grad doubts not you will mount, national television should look again at the relatively conservative college on the Susquehanna. The classes of '91, '92, '93, '94 can help redirect destiny. If this mem ber of the prehistoric class of 1929 can assist, do not hesitate to call. If enough of us can rev up enough indignation, a suffering world MIGHT be spared another exercise in tragedy and imbecility. Anyway, I'm proud on my Alma Mater. I'm proud of you! Carry on. Robert L.

Area resident and WW II,
survivor calls for peace,"To the Editor: Call me emotional, hysteri cal, fanatic--I am all of these. I cannot bring myself to re-read Pro fessor Travis' academic discussion in The Bucknellian in order to write a rational response to his elaboration of the pros and cons of war vs. economic sanctions, the greater costs or losses of one vs. the other, to resolve the Gulf Crisis. Nor do I expect to convince a single person by a written word who has not experienced war. I literally weep in the night 45 years after the end of WWII which was and still is a real live gut experience for me. If the writers criticizing S.T.O.P. in last week's Bucknellian could hear the screams of the children, or the wail of their parents and grandparents, or the agonized howls of the wounded soldiers there would be no need to defend the writings and actions of"
S.T.O.P.,"And yet the horrors I will have to live with to the end of my days arc nothing compared with those of any future war. We cannot think about and discuss war, any war, in the abstract. And we must constantly bear in mind that WWII was only a conventional war. Future wars should be unthinkable: it would be hi-tech nuclear omnicide (the killing of us all), not a 'contained' quick fix. What we must fight if we want to survive is poverty, homelessness, inadequate health care and educa tion, addictions including that of consumerism. These are our real enemies at home and abroad. Brigitte M. Cooke Lewisburg December 5,1990"
S.T.O.P. -,"From page 8 in the Persian Gulf crisis have died due to accidents. We are quite aware of that and we realize that ""accidents do happen."" Even so, the incidence of fatal accidents is far higher in this rushed deploy ment than normally happens in peace time. More importantly, these individuals have died in the name of a cause that is totally unjustified, whether by accident or not. The purpose of the tombstones was twofold: to make people aware that those soldiers had already died in the name of an unjustified cause and to call for the return of those soldiers still there so that no more will die. Contrary to popular belief, we do support the soldiers over there and members of the group have written letters to members of the American military currently in Saudi Arabia. It is not their fault that the administration is conduct ing these operations in the Gulf. We want a peaceful solution so that they may return home to their loved ones without harm. Second, Mr. Shaw points out that we need oil from Iraq for our livelihood. But why? We are so heavily dependent on oil because the major corporations that make money from the oil have structured it that way. By supporting Bush, you are primarily supporting the few individuals at the top of the major oil corporations that have become millionaires by insuring that we need oil and then by charg ing each of us so much for it. It would indeed cost a great deal less money if we developed an electric light transit public transportation system in major cities and pro duced cars that could travel further on a lank of gas. These technolo gies do exist now, but those with the economic power will not let them go mainstream because that would mean a significant decrease in their profits. Consider that it costs roughly $100 million to build one mile of highway while it costs only $15 million to build one mile of light transit. And why is it that automobiles getting 120 mpg do exist, but we cannot get them? What would happen if we got our oil from other places for the time being, meanwhile working on alter native energy with the billions of dollars we are currently spending on the crisis? There are other points we would also like to make about oil. Many people have asserted that we arc in the Persian Gulf for the sake of cheap oil. We would like to sug gest that perhaps the United States does not want cheap oil. The two top oil suppliers in the world are the Soviet Union and us. Half of the oil we use is produced in this country. Therefore, our companies have a great stake in high oil prices; the higher they go, the more money American oil companies make. For instance, in 1986, when oil prices dropped to roughly $10/ barrel, Reagan made Saudi Arabia cut back on production so that the prices would again rise. It is also highly doubtful that Iraq and Kuwait's combined 6% of the total oil production would have that much effect on world oil prices anyway. There are so many wells off line now in Venezuela and Saudi Arabia that even if Hussein caused prices to rise a few dollars at first, they would quickly adjust themselves as supply increased from these wells coming back on line. In fact, these two countries along with other OPEC nations have already raised production enough to more than offset the entire output of Kuwait and Iraq. The war would also raise our already $225 billion annual deficit, quite possibly by another $100 billion. Mr. Shaw's third point is just blatantly racist. He describes the Arab culture as ""tribal, fanatical, and antagonistic."" A careful study of Islam and the Arab culture dis putes this claim. Anyone believing the anti-Arab rhetoric issued by the President ought to have a second look. There is already a great deal of protest from Arab Americans in this country regarding Bush's racist language against this people. This perhaps the most dangerous aspect of this situation. With the American people treating Arabs as somehow sub-human, anything can happen. Why are we, as fellow human beings, in any way superior? S.T.O.P. docs not require that everyone agree with us. But we do require that you educate yourselves sufficiently to carry on an educated debate on the subject. Is it enough to listen to Bush's press confer ences and to read the New York Times daily? Of course not. In doing this, you arc hearing only one side of the issue--that side that the current administration wants you to hear. There are many forms of alternative press out there in addition to professors right here on campus that have insights unavaila ble to the general public in the form of major media. Mr. Shaw tells us we do not know what we are talk ing about. But his own sentiments are just those easily picked up from major media. Anyone can do what he did; the challenge is to dig deeper, then form an opinion. We do not consider ourselves to be totally educated; we are presenting another side while learning with you. S.T.O.P. docs not wish to alienate or to provoke a harsh debate on campus; our fight is pri marily for those who could poten tially die in the Gulf during this conflict, not against fellow Buck- ncllians. Maybe we should all work to avoid petty differences and try to join together to end this situation that affects each one of us. If you are interested in get ting more information, we invite you to please contact S.T.O.P., C- 3094."
S.T.O.P.,"December 5,1990"
People must form their own opinions about Gulf crisis,"By Jon Hansen I have heard on occasion that it is unwise to discuss politics at the dinner table. At a caf dinner, however, sometimes the discussion is the only thing that is heated (and that includes the hot dogs). One particular evening the meal was chicken, and the debate focused on the Per sian Gulf. I was talking to an upperclassman, debating foreign policy and the use of force in the Gulf. Upon explaining that I believed force may be necessary in that region, he informed me that I should become better educated. This statement stung like a slap in the face, and to be quite honest, was rather insulting. I have spent a lot of time thinking over the Gulf situation, and have come to a morally acceptable view for myself. It is difficult to come to the conclu sion that people may die in defense of your beliefs. It is even more difficult to realize that friends, or even yourself, could be fighting in a desert thousands of miles away from home. Yet I have come to my conclusion, and can live with it. My adversary apologized and stated that he was frustrated with people who express no viewpoint, and was pleased (in a way) when people respond negatively to his views, because it demonstrates that they are thinking of the issue. I agreed that it is difficult not to become frustrated when people are ignorant, or just don't care about anything not directly affecting themselves. This person has worked with S.T.O.P. and continued to explain how difficult it is when the only way people respond to ideas is to tear down posters, or knock down mock graves. One must realize, however, that people who perpetrate such acts are too unintelligent or too scared to make a pow erful statement. They must rely on childish methods of reaction, methods that demon strate a fear to face controversy. I, like everyone else, believe my opinion is correct--for me this basically defines an opinion. It is when one attempts to force his opinion on someone else, that anger or resentment can arise. When I first became aware of S.T.O.P.'s activities on campus, I believed they were prophesying what they believed to be the only accepta ble view on the Gulf crisis. I have since talked with members of S.T.O.P and realize that they are trying to express a well rounded view of the situation. Every news media source is biased in one way or another. What I was told is that S.T.O.P. is trying to look at as many sources as possi ble, to better educate the campus. If the group had emphasized this approach from the beginning, perhaps they could have avoided some of the unnecessary negative criticism, and been more successful. Perhaps not. For no matter how detailed a report you present, you can not force people to care. I graduated from a pri vate school where the people, both students and faculty, were very politically aware. Students worked for Congressmen, pro tested, and were generally very well- informed as to the events unfolding in the world. Not. everyone was active, but I would state that ninety percent of the cam pus was what I would consider knowledge able of current affairs. At Bucknell, there are people who work for Congressmen, and protest. I would guess, however, that only about ten percent of the campus is politically aware. We are on the brink of war, and people just do not seem that con cerned. It seems important enough to me to shell out thirty-five cents a day to know what is happening, and what future events hold for the world. This attitude, or lack of concern, may be changing, but it practi cally required draft cards in mailboxes to make people aware. Perhaps if the conflict was over alcohol, and not oil, the Bucknell Campus would have a greater interest. After all, at Bucknell, you can probably survive without oil, but not Budweiser. \ page 10"

Why is the United States in the Persian Gulf?,
"Bush has hidden motives, wants to keep up US' supportive appearances","By Dean Baker ""If my grandmother had wheels, she'd be a bus."" This was the standard quip that one of my undergraduate philosophy profes sors used to respond to the irrele vant comments I made in his class. The thrust of Professor Travis' arti cle is to lay out the conditions under which a U.S. military attack against Iraq would be justified as an action in support of international law. While I have the greatest respect for the principle of interna tional law (I was arrested three times in the last decade committing acts of civil disobedience as part of an effort to get the U.S. to respect international law in Central Amer ica), it has absolutely no relevance to the U.S. military presence in the Persian Gulf. The U.S. was, and continues to be, a leading international out law. The list of violations would be far too extensive to include in a short article, but a few quick exam ples could establish the point. The invasions of Granada, and Panama were both carried through in viola tion of international law and faced near unanimous condemnation at the U.N. Our attacks against Nica ragua were also carried through in violation of international law and were also subject to near- unanimous international condemna tion. And lest anyone think these breaches --.. are relics of a differ ent era which we have now tran scended with our ""new world order,"" it is necessary only to point out that the ...."
U.S.,"continues to defy a World Court ruling requiring it to pay billions in damages to Nic aragua, that it continues to ignore the international Law of the Sea, and that it just initiated the broad cast of televised propaganda into Cuba in violation of international conventions on control of commu nications frequencies. In short, the U.S. has never had any use for international law, except as a prop aganda weapon to gain support for a policy that could not stand on its own merits. If not international law, then what motivates the U.S. policy? Certainly not the outrage against a blatant act of aggression (which the invasion of Kuwait clearly was). One can point to similar acts of aggression all over the world in the last few decades that received no comparable response. Again, using the short list to save space, in 1974 Turkey invaded and occupied Cyprus, in 1975 Indonesia invaded and occupied East Timor, Morocco invaded and occupied the Spanish Sahara, and South Africa invaded Angola, in 1977 Somalia invaded Ethiopia, in 1978 and 1982 Israel invaded Lebanon. In each case the aggressor nation was allied with the U.S., and no serious pressure was brought to bear to end the aggres sion. No one raised the possibility of U.S. military action against the aggressor. What about Saddam Huss ein's nuclear weapons? This spec- tor is perhaps the most cynical effort at public manipulation yet devised by the Bush administration. Three weeks ago a CBS-New York Times poll revealed that the public was opposed to going to war with Iraq for most of the reasons then being touted by the Bush adminis tration. The one reason that did enjoy public support was attacking in order to remove the threat of Iraqi nuclear weapons. Suddenly Bush began lacing his speeches with comments about the need to eliminate Iraq's nuclear capability. Unnamed ""experts"" began leaking reports to the media about Iraq's nuclear arsenal, which of course the media dutifully presented as ""news."" In fact, most independent experts think it will be at least 2-5 years before Iraq develops any nuclear weapons. Furthermore, even if they do develop one or two crude nuclear weapons, it would be absolutely suicidal for Iraq to use them, because they would not do enough damage to change the out come of a war, but they would vir tually guarantee that Iraq would be decimated by U.S. nuclear rctalia-"
ln order to maintain,
our...relationship the United States,
has to be seen coming to the aid of,
"Kuwait, ...in its hour of need.","lion. (Returning to the topic of international law briefly, the United States has always refused to go along with an agreement that it would not use nuclear weapons against a non-nuclear power. This agreement has received virtually unanimous support from the nations of the world, including the Soviet Union.) It is also the case that Iraq is not the only nation with unpredictable and belligerent lead ers to have a nuclear weapons pro gram. Pakistan, Israel, and South Africa arc ahead of Iraq in develop ing nuclear weapons, with the latter two probably already possessing substantial nuclear arsenals. Could oil have anything to do with Bush's belligerent stand? If people believe that the U.S. is going to war to ensure that the price of gasoline stays low, then they have been deceived into think ing that we're fighting for a more noble cause than is actually the case. In fact, Bush does not particu larly want cheap oil, and further more, even if Hussein were left in control of Kuwait, he would not be able to push up the price of oil very far. One piece of the puzzle that is often ignored is that the U.S. is the world's second largest producer of oil. Our domestic oil companies (one of which used to be run by our president) don't want cheap imported oil available, because it depresses the prices they can charge, and their profits. This is the reason Bush paid a visit to Saudi Arabia in 1986 to tell the King to cut back production in order to raise world oil prices. The U.S. has a long history of taking such steps to keep the price of oil up, not down. The other side of the coin is Hussein's ability to affect world oil prices. Even with Kuwait, he still would control less than 7% of world oil production, an amount that is currently being fully offset by increased production from Saudi Arabia, Mexico, and elsewhere. Oil is part of _ _ _ _ _ the picture though. Exxon, Mobil and the other major oil companies cam thou sands of millions of dollars of profits each year by .. shipping oil from the Persian Gulf area not just to the United States, but also to Europe, Japan and other nations around the world. The reason so much of this trade is controlled by U.S. (and British) oil companies is not attributable to their wizardry at shipping and marketing oil. Rather, it is primarily attributable to the United States' ""special relation ship"" with the Persian Gulf monar chies. The terms of this relationship are essentially that the U.S. pro vides protection to the monarchies against both external and internal enemies; in exchange U.S. oil com panies get preferential access to the region's oil. In addition, the monar chies deposit much of their oil wealth in U.S. banks, and also buy large amounts of high tech weap onry from U.S. corporations. Just in the months since the Iraqi invasion, Saudi Arabia committed itself to buying 20 thousand million dollars of additional weaponry from U.S. firms. In order to maintain our end of this relationship the United States 11 has to be seen com ing to the aid of Kuwait, one of its protectorates (also one in which Brit ain shares a signifi cant interest), in its -- -- -- hour of need. This means that it is important that the U.S. use its mili tary power to reinstall the Emir of Kuwait so that the other monar chies will be assured that they can rely on us. For this reason it would actually not be to the advantage of the United States (or at least its oil companies and military contrac tors) if international economic sanctions were to bring about the withdrawal of Iraq from Kuwait. Nor would it be seen as advanta geous if an Iraqi withdrawal were to be coupled with the coming to power of a democratically elected ; government in Kuwait, a likely out- i come of a negotiated solution, since this would mean that the U.S. had not protected its friend, the Emir. The special relationship between the U.S. and Britain and the Persian Gulf monarchies also explains why the U.S. and Britain are so much more anxious to go to war than other European nations or Japan, even though the latter are far more dependent on Persian Gulf oil. These nations know that what ever the outcome of the current sit uation, the countries in the Persian Gulf still will want to sell them oil, so they have little reason to be con cerned as to whether Saddam Huss ein or the Emir of Kuwait is the person collecting the revenue. No one should think that these nations are reluctant to use military force when their economic interests are at stake; their major colonial wars are not that far in the past, and Africa is still littered with French and Belgium troops. Their lack of interest is simply due to the fact that it's not their oil companies that are seeing their profits threatened. There is another important reason why Bush is anxious to use force in Iraq: to protect the military budget. In a period when the U.S. faces record budget deficits, and it cannot find the money to provide decent education, health care and housing for its population, it is very difficult to justify a 300 thousand"
There is another important reason,
why Bush is anxious to use force in,
Iraq: to protect the military budget.,"million dollar military budget, par ticularly when the U.S. lacks any real military threat. It had seemed almost certain that political pressure would force very sizable cuts in the military budget. Such cuts presented a terri fying prospect to military contrac tors, a group that is well repre sented in the list of the nation's largest corporations. This situation was completely reversed by the invasion of Kuwait. The war dividend was felt immediately. The Senate was debating a measure to cut off fund ing for the super-sophisticated Stealth bomber the day of the inva sion. The measure had seemed likely to pass, since the bomber, which carries a price lag of $800 million per plane, was designed to evade state of the art Soviet radar that they were in the process of developing. In the absence of the Soviet threat, it seemed ridiculous to be throwing out such enormous amounts of money on high tech gadgetry. Nonetheless, in the wake of the Iraqi invasion, the Senate voted to continue funding because of the threat posed by Saddam Hussein. While the justification for the spending was absurd (one expert likened it to using a hand grenade to kill a mosquito) it kept the funding flowing. In coming years we arc likely to sec hundreds of billions of dollars more of mili tary spending justified by similar illogic. While there arc other reasons that Bush may want to go to war in the Gulf (such as keeping his son's involvement in the S&L scandal out of the headlines, and protecting Israel's military dominance in the Middle East), they arc no more sal able to the U.S. public then the ones discussed above. Conse quently, Bush runs around talking about Hussein's nuclear threat or about creating a ""new world order"" where national sovereignty and international law will be respected by all nations. For ... -- those of us who actu ally care about such things, it is impera tive that we work to stop Bush's war. Hussein's invasion is a serious matter and 1 it should be dealt with. But there is every reason to believe that continued economic sanctions coupled with negotiations (it seems that the ""negotiations"" that Bush has recently proposed will involve little more than deliv ering an ultimatum in person) will lead to an Iraqi withdrawal and a real victory for international coop eration. It might even help pave the way for a genuinely new interna tional order based on international law and the peaceful resolution of conflicts, rather than one based on the interests of U.S. corporations and U.S. military power. According to the constitution it is necessary for Bush to obtain congressional approval before ini tiating a war in the Persian Gulf. You can help stop this war by con tacting your senators or representa tives and urging them to demand that a declaration of war be debated by congress (as required by the constitution), and that they vote against this declaration.

BSG vote produces disappointing results,"By David Murray The results of the BSG elections, published in last week's issue of The Bucknellian, shocked and offended me. Not only am I upset by the low turn out at the elections, I am amazed by the outcome. With our votes, we elected at least one candidate who seems to me completely unqualified. Her opponent, how ever, had a strong platform, valu able experience, enthusiasm, and talent. How could we make such a mistake? I wonder how those students who did vote decided whom they should support. Of all the BSG officers, I believe the treasurer holds the most important position. While the BSG president must adminis trate the functioning of the gov ernment in general, he needn't interact extensively with the campus. The treasurer however, as head of the appropriations committee, must work with every student group requesting BSG funding. The treasurer is responsible for hundreds of thou sands of dollars of our money each year, and must distribute those funds equitably and expeditiously. We have elected, by a 52% to 48% margin, Vanessa Mayo '93 as BSG treasurer. We have failed to elect Dave Fries '93. Why? We voters clearly did not educate ourselves sufficiently about the candidates. We could have teen (15!) students attended that forum. We could also have read the candidates' comments in The Buck- Fries: BSG Congressman for the past two years.

There, after making short speeches and presenting their platforms, the candidates answered questions from students in the audi ence. The problem is that only fif- nellian. By themselves, the printed responses of Mayo and Fries make clear the better candidate for the job. Compare, among others, their answers about experience: the Treasurer: last semester on the Executive Committee, this semes ter on Appropriations. I got to see the questions and the actual prob ing that the current treasurer went through. Mayo: I'm treasurer for two clubs. I've been on commit tees and groups; nothing directly pertaining to BSG. It's not Ms. Mayo's fault that she was elected; it's our fault that we elected her! We all had ample opportunity to learn who the candidates were, what they stood for, and how quali fied they were. At that task, however, we voters failed miser ably, as can be seen in the elec tion results. Now, the students, faculty, and administration here must live with a decision 965 students made for them: an incompetent at the fiscal helm. I wish Ms. Mayo luck--she'll need it, as she can't know the tasks that lie before her. To the students: look carefully at the $100 student activities fee you submit next year.

"Like America, WVBU",
must censor its music,"By John Devecka Let's get a few simple points out of the way first, just so you know where I stand. I am a regis tered Republican. I really hate listening to rap music. I am an atheist. I am unable to understand homosexuality. Oh yeah, and I am a white, upper- middle class male. The perfect Bucknellian? Not really; I actually mean what I say, and 1 don't care about the new Bison. Ok, now that stated, I am here to attempt to explain and refute the current rage of intolerance toward the music industry, and censorship in gen eral. As the 1990's open, we find ourselves under an increasing wave of moral self-righteousness, wash ing over nearly all aspects of our lives, from the sim ple awareness of which term one uses for a black person, regardless of their heritage, to the extreme of jailing a man for selling a record album. This won derful world we arc living in is slowly being engulfed by the overly-vocal minority: the religious zealot, if you will. In a time when television is becoming more graphic and violent, you cannot buy certain rap albums in Broward County, Florida or go sec photo graphs in Cincinnati, but you can deny a woman her freedom of choice. I guess I can't understand the Florida after performing for an ""adults only"" audience. * a San Antonio, Texas judge has refused to dismiss obscenity charges against the owner of Hog Wild Records for selling a copy of Two Live Crew's album ""As Nasty As They Wanna Be"". * Charles Freeman, a record store owner in Ft. Lauderdale was found guilty of selling the same album, denied a retrial, and will be sen tenced within the next two weeks. * A DJ and store owner in Oltowa, Canada was arrested for the above excuse and faces up to two years in prison. * The band Too Much Joy went to Broward County to play a concert of Two Live Crew songs to an ovcr-21 audience; they were arrested. I am appalled at the mere thought that my kids (since by then I won't be willing to risk an illegal clinic, despite my inability to support a wife and kid) will be unable to buy an album that has the word ""s--t"" on it. Perhaps this is a good time to mention that many of the ""classics"" have such language but have managed to elude the cen sors. Pink Floyd's song ""Money"", which is on the most consistent selling album of all time, and gets massive radio play, contains one ""bulls--t"", which is quite audible. hyper-religious mind, or where they get the nerve to rewrite the Constitution and Bill of Rights. As the music director of WVBU, I suppose I am a bit of a music zealot myself, so I can't understand people who say ""it's just music"". How does this involve you, the simple Buck- ncll student? I'm glad you asked. It is a little known fact that the music you hear on WVBU, your very own college station, is censored. You know why this bugs me so much? Because I'm the one who has the responsibility of being the censor! I am the one who chooses what you can listen to. Why? Because the Federal Communications Commission, the brilliant government body in charge of radio regulations, wants it that way. As the music director for the sta tion, I am the guy who previews all (more or less) of the music you hear. I get to write ""DO NOT PLAY"" on the CD or LP that says ""s--t"". And boy do I revel in the power of my position...Not! I hate cringing when I hear a bad word on the air, almost as much as I hate calling the DJ and trying to explain that I am not the pencil-pushing pinhead making the rules, just the poor sap who has to enforce them. The other day a new record came in by the Limbomaniacs, titled ""Buttfunkin"". I saw the evil lyric warning sticker and sobbed. After finding that half of the songs contained at least one naughty word, I made the wretched decision that it wasn't worth the risk...No airplay for this new band. A few days later I had an extended conversation with their promoter, during which I attempted to explain that I really hated to do what I felt was necessary. Fortu nately, he had experienced this already--the fear has spread. You may not take the seventy churches in town seriously but I have to. All it takes is a com plaint to the FCC, and the Board of Trustees has some explaining to do, along with the Board of WVBU and the DJ who played the record. What a stupid world. Lemmy, from the heavy-metal band Motor- head, recently gave a lecture on censorship at the College Music Journal Metal Marathon, asking sev eral simple questions: ""where will it end?"" and ""why is it happening?"" I can only hope that it will end soon, but it will take all of us to do something about eliminating the uptight morality of censorship. Gad, I sound like some protesting liberal-type! Well, they can be right, occasionally. You who sit back and say, ""it'll pass"", think about these tidbits: * members of the rap act Two Live Crew were arrested on obscenity charges in Broward County, On another front we have the attacks on music because of its message. ""Satanism"", geez. I'm going to freak out if I hear this excuse again. Time to freak out, KNOS-FM in Missouri has decided that it will play no records from the com pany that released the latest albums by King Dia mond and Dcicidc (what a great name!) and has returned its entire Roadraccr Records catalogue to the label in protest. They state that the label is ""associated with at least two groups that I [ the general manager of KNOS ] know of that espouse Satanism...We really don't want to have anything to do with anybody who is ATTACHED to any body who is very outwardly Satanic...we don't want to cut anybody off from their beliefs--even God wouldn't do that--but we also don't want to have anything to do with them."" (CMJ 11/16/90 p4). Hasn't anyone caught on yet that ""Satanism"" is a gimmick that sells records? And how can this station say that they won't ""cut anybody off from their beliefs"" unless they ask all of their listeners for an opinion on their censorship? Let's talk about record labels. I don't know about you, but I'm appalled by the idea of some group imposing its own moral structure on music for the general public. Who gets to decide what's offensive? I cast my vote for Anton LcVay, author of the Satanic Bible; at least we know where he stands. A 200-storc music chain in the southern part of this nation has declared that it will not stock ANY recording that bears a label. Well gee, that makes sense. Do their customers know about this? Do they care? I will concede that there are certain lyrics that offend me--BUT 1 DON'T BUY THE D--N ALBUMS! It is absurd to say that because I hate Muzak that it should be ban ished to the depths of Hell from which it sprang-- actually, hey let's call our Congrcsspeople, and pressure local church groups and that guy who always wants my money on TV, yeah, DEATH TO MUZAK! What I'm trying to point out is that the men tality that attacks the music is universally screwed up. Why can't it be left alone? Oh sure, put ratings on it--that'll work. Just look at its success in the movie industry. Let's hope that the latest burst of censorship is as stunning a success hs Prohibition. I, for one, will be in any speakeasy that plays good tunes. There's still a pile of records on my desk that await listening; if anybody has a match I'll just save myself the trouble..."
Sexual attitudes often lead,
to assaults on campuses,"By Chris O'Sullivan Your Nov. 12 report on an allegation of rape at a University of Rhode Island fraternity house, and an aftermath that included the sui cide of a student who was to meet the police and discuss what he saw on the night in question, was dis turbing but unsurprising in many respects. Along with the event, some of the reported reactions to the alleged assault arc familiar and troubling. You raise the unanswerable question of whether campus sexual assaults, or merely the reporting of such assaults, arc increasing. If the rate of assaults is increasing, the increase must be accounted for by changes in society or campus life. If it is primarily the reports that arc increasing, there has been a posi tive change in one regard and a negative status quo in another. Because we do not know the answer, we would do better to look at the situations in which assaults occur for the social contexts that promote them than to speculate about which changes on campus or in society may be responsible. Yet both the putative reasons for the problem and suggested solutions ignore such information. For example, one reason you report as given by university offi cials for the supposed increase in campus rapes is the innovation of mixed-sex dormitories. My research shows that incidents like the one that prompted you report, involving a number of men as onlookers or participants in a sex ual assault, occur most often in all- malc housing. This case, occurring at a fraternity house, is typical in that regard. Other cases have occurred in men's dormitories in violation of visiting hours for women (for example, a recent alleged rape of a woman visiting the University of Tennessee men's athletic dorm). According to your report, women on campus want more safety measures. The sort of pre ventive measures this request seems to imply (better lighting? locks? security patrols?) could only be effective against stranger rape, particularly by non-students. How can a woman be protected by belter safety measures from sexual assault by fellow students at a campus party? ""University officials"" also note that 70% to 80% of discipli nary problems arc alcohol-related. Surely, there arc other constants in antisocial behavior. It may also be true that 70% to 80% of the prob lems involve men, occur when stu dents arc partying and take place at night. Although it may seem that drinking is relatively controllable, if it is possible that the problems are gcndcr-rclaicd, one should question how much change elimi nating alcohol on campus would produce. In any case, controlling drinking on campus may simply drive parties off campus and underground. Finally, designating as equiv alent in their victimization the man originally accused of rape, one of the men who allegedly watched the rape and then killed himself, and the woman who made the rape charge is also a familiar theme (although perhaps more justifiable in this case than most). It is com mon for alleged perpetrators of sex ual assault to be regarded as vic tims within their community, whether that community is a racial- ethnic group (as in the New Bed ford, Mass., case) fans (of the Washington Capitols, for instance) or a campus community of students. In most cases, those who view alleged perpetrators as victims target the woman as the victimizcr (for reporting their behavior), even when the men admit to some form of reprehensible group sexual exploitation. If those men who confess to such exploitation while denying criminal culpability arc anyone's victims, they arc victims of their own group norms. Such groups of men on campus (and in other seg ments of society) have set up the sexual humiliation of women as a positive value, rewarding it with approval. In many fraternities these values arc expressed in a variety of practices, from having ugly-date contests (won by the man who takes the most unattractive woman to bed) to arrangements for observ ing sexual encounters, including peepholes into bedrooms and vide otaping setups. These settings arc the ones in which the majority of group sexual offenses on campus occur. Students and administrators who sincerely desire to make changes that would reduce the assault on women on campus should consider that to do this will require profound, and not merely cosmetic, social change. Editor's Note: Chris O'Sullivan is a social psychologist who conducts research on group sexual assault on campus. Her opinion first appeared in the December 5 New York Times."
BIO provides a support,
group for foreign students,"By Paul Sechopoulos As a foreign student and member of the Buckneli Interna tional Organization (BIO) for j three years, I was very upset when I found out that our budget was slashed by 65% by the BSG Appropriations Committee. My feelings turned to disbelief when I read the opinion published in The Bucknellian two weeks ago. First of all, our member list has 250 people. Maybe not all 250 show up to our regular meeting, but I can assure you that a very high percentage of those 250 show up for our activities. Furthermore, most of the members are not involved in other organizations simply because they do not feel as identified with them as they do with BIO. Most of us are foreigners, and as most human beings do when they travel abroad, we like to hang out together. The same way Americans like to hang out together when they travel and study abroad. Most of us feel we have a lot in common with other foreigners. American culture is too different, and although the mem bers of BIO share different cultures and come from different countries we have some things in common. Some of us do miss home, and that's not just three hours away. We don't sec our families for a whole year, sometimes even more. During Thanksgiving, and other breaks, some of us stay on campus, while others go to friends' houses, but we don't go home. What I'm trying to say is that we share feelings that arc hard to explain to many Americans. Just as it will be hard for us to understand Americans coming up to us, telling us how they miss their family, speaking their own language, fast food, Thanksgiving or any other American tradition that they miss. BIO has provided for us, an organization that we can fall back on, giving us an opportunity to meet people from our respective countries, speaking our own lan guages and meeting other people that share the same feelings that we do. Contrary to popular belief, however, we don't segregate our selves. Our organization is open to anyone who wants to join. There arc Americans that arc part of BIO, in fact our vice-president, and sec retary arc Americans. Finally, the reason we are thinking of disbanding is because we don't want to be used. We have only been funded for one activity this year, the International Festival. Some of us think that there is no point for an organization to exist solely for the purpose of carrying out one activity. When the time comes, the school can set up a com mittee and carry out the festival. We don't want prospective foreign students to come here, thinking that there is an interna tional organization on campus, only to realize when it is too late, that it really docs not exist."

Robert Cray Band returns for a,
Midnight Stroll,
down blues lane,
Renowned blues artist does it,
again with his sixth album,"By Matthew Wood Ten years and now six albums into his career, Robert Cray has built himself into a quiet force in music today. With a razor sharp guitar and a strong, distinct voice, what could possibly be keeping this musician from becoming a house hold name? One simple reason: Robert Cray sings the blues. The blues arc not to be con fused with Rhythm and Blues, a sweeping category into which most of today's pop music can fit. Rather, the blues, as Cray himself says, arc about sadness, strife, and guilt, most commonly associated with the struggle between the sexes. The blues are morbid and emo tional; they are not about selling 2 million records. Despite this, Cray has man aged to build quite a name for him self and those who have seen him perform are convinced of his merit. Since his 1986 album Strong Per suader, he has also caught the eyes of fellow musicians. Cray has since worked with Eric Clapton, Tina Turner, and John Lee Hocker, among others. Cray's new album, Midnight Stroll, is in keeping with his past efforts, especially his most recent Don't be Afraid of the Dark, and Strong Persuader. As usual, he has enlisted the help of the Memphis Homs and has also added touring guitarist Tim Kaihatsu as a full- fledged member of the band. Those who know Cray, know that his albums do not feature two or three hits followed by filler material. Instead, his blues rely on making all songs strong and listenable. Herein lies the strength of his music. It is difficult to find albums that can be played from start to fin ish without annoying the listener at some point. In this way, Cray is a rare gem and Midnight Stroll fur thers this tradition in blues. For this reason, it's both difficult and fool ish for me to make a haphazard list of "" the album's best songs,"" for there is no such list. Cray fans have their own personal favorites, most likely the songs they find applica ble to themselves. For those of you wondering if you have heard any of the songs and not known it, ""The Forecast"
>>.,"Courtesy of Polygram Records Inc. copyright T990 The Robert Cray Band has been cranking out the blues for a decade now, and although they don't have one of the top Hot 100 Albums this week, the band is still going strong and attracting listeners.

General Lee Speaking,
"""Home Alone "" is shallow com edy","and give it a listen. If you enjoy music at all, you probably won't be disappointed. Robert Cray's Midnight Stroll earns 4 out of 5 stars. By Lee Guzofski Staff Writer Greetings, Bucknell! Boy, do I have a treat for you! Home Alone ! You know, that silly looking film with the little kid that gets left home by his parents and has to defend his house against the attack of two thieves. Come on, you know the one... Gee, the movie sure looked good in previews didn't it? The lit tle kid who's so ingenious that he uses his toys to serve as boobie traps. Ha! What a laugh riot! Let me let you in on a little secret... This movie is horrid. All of the good, almost-laughable scenes were shown in the previews. This movie is little but kiddie fodder which will have millions of chil dren across the country learning new ways to torment their parents. The movie is about a small child who is abandoned and forgot ten by his parents when they take a family trip to Paris. Upon realizing that he has been left behind, he is at first thrilled to have the house to himself, without a family to bug him and tell him what to do. How ever, eventually he misses his fam ily and asks to have them back. The plot receives its only laughable twist when two bum bling cat burglars attempt to rob his house. The child realizes that his house is under attack and assumes responsibility for defending it. True, some of his defenses are clever and deserving of a chuckle or two. But some of them are just downright dangerous and absurd. This film attempted to cash in on the Problem Child premise where a pesky little child gets on his parents nerves. It was a poor excuse for entertainment: One can get very sick of "" little-kid-getting- the-better-of-adult"" movie themes.

Indoor track hosts Bucknell Invitational,
"Shippensburg, Susquehanna visit Lewisburg tomorrow","By Scott Brown Staff Writer Bucknell opened its track season this past weekend with the Eighth Annual Bucknell Invita tional. Although this was a non scoring meet, both the men's and women's teams had impressive performances. _ The men's team has won or shared nine straight indoor titles in the East Coast Confer ence. It hopes its __________________ success will carry over to its first season in the Patriot League. In order to do this, the Bison must be able to score highly in the sprints and hurdles to go along with their perennial success in the distance events. A step in the right direction was taken last Saturday when Jim Bock '92 led the Bison with two victories. He won the 60-yard dash in 6.3 seconds, the second-fastest o f 32.3 seconds, the lime in Bucknell with a time third-fastest history. Bucknell also must count on its newcomers, as many runners are inexperienced in collegiate competi tion.

From leftfield...,
Surprising week in the sports world,"By M ark Griffith and Eric Smith Staff Writers The past few weeks have witnessed an incredible array of bizarre occurrences in the world of sports. What is to blame for this rash of unexplainable events? Is it perhaps the excess broccoli on the global economy? Or maybe an unusual planetary alignment is the culprit. Whatever the reason, the two gurus of sports, yours truly, will give you an idea of the ramifications of this positively unnatural phenomenon. Week 12 of the National Football League begins our chronology. Up until this week the six division leaders had a combined record of 51-9. But on this strange weekend, all six of the league's front-runners lost (an event that had not happened since the AFL-NFL merger). At this point, it is also fitting to examine where certain teams stand going into the homestretch of the season. Who would believe the Cleveland Browns would be mathematically eliminated in Week 13? For that matter, how about the downfall of both the Denver Broncos and Los Angeles Rams, who own records of 3-9 and 5-7, respectively. On the other hand, following an upset win on Thanksgiving, the Dallas Cowboys are in the middle of the wild-card race in the NFC. In the National Basketball Association, many liked the New York Knicks to win the Atlantic Division. But we have one thing to say; "" You guys are a half-game ahead of the Nets!"" It appears firing Head Coach Stu Jackson earlier in the week did not produce a desirable effect; the Knicks lost again at Madison Square Garden to the lowly Orlando Magic. Welcome to New York John MacLeod. In an unprecedented move, the N C A A  rescinded an earlier deci sion to ban the Runnin' Rebels of U N LV from post-season play this year. The reversal allows U N LV to defend its national championship this season, and the Rebels in return will sit out the 1992 tournament and abstain from appearing on national television during the '91-92 season. And who says the N CA A  has changed its money-grubbing ways? On to the high-priced baseball circuit, where millions of dollars are being thrown around for...well, we'll let you decide. The over-rated Darryl Strawberry was all smiles when the Los Angeles Dodgers agreed to pay him over $20 million for five years. Other quirky con tracts in this year's free-agent pool include the signing of an 8-18 pitcher, Matt Young, by the Boston Red Sox for almost $3 million/ycar over the next three years. We hope Matt finds the confines of Fenway Park a bit more friendly than the Seattle Kingdome. But then again, with three million dollars under your belt, would you care? With the incredible rise in mediocre pitcher's salaries this winter, the Yankees should not feel badly about paying Pasqual Perez two million dollars again this year (sure). Well, to close our semester-long party, we'd like to state that at this time, four of our six predicted NFL division winners are cur rently in first Also, two of our four National Hockey League projected front-runners are following suit. See you in '91! dash, crossing the tape in 26.0 sec onds. She currently holds the Buck nell indoor record in the 300-yard run. The highlight of the meet for the women came when Karen Shimomura '91 set a school record in the 60-yard high hurdles, finish ing in 8.2 seconds. She broke the old record, which was set by Lon nie Fertik in 1982. Lynette McBride '91 again had a strong showing. She won the long jump, an event which she holds the Bucknell record, with a leap of 18'-1"". Jennifer Thomas '94 took the triple jump title with a leap of 35'-6 1/2"". Other winners for the Bison included Erin Ryan '93 in the 880-yard run. She raced to vic tory with a time of 2:24.1. Kris Deardoff '93 won the two-mile run in 12:28.1. Both teams will face both Shippensberg and Susquehanna tomorrow. Plasko thinks both squads "" looked strong last Satur day. I think we should show a lot of potential as the year goes on. We are a young team, and I look for us to improve."""

Bison ice hockey team looks,

M , a r'F -S lB >> - __ u B f e ,. ..sjy sli: y By Jennifer Walsh and Jam ie Diaferia Staff Writers After accumulating a record of 24-9 last season, ice hockey co captain Carl Zuckerberg '91 and teammate Pete Troost '91 expressed optimism about the upcoming season. The team will sport a new look that includes a more aggressive style of play and improved basic skills in hopes of improving on last season's success. "" This year should be our best ever,"" said Zuckerburg. He noted that this year's team has improved in many areas from last season. This includes better defense and puck sense which, according to Zuckerman, will result in more goals being scored than in the past. He also added that the physical size of individual players has increased, an asset that will enable them to implement a different style of play than the one used previously. The Bison hockey team expects to be more aggressive than ever before based on their new found size advantage. This style of play will be quite different than last season's shoot and skate, finesse See IC E  H O C K E Y , page 17 4* File Photo/The Bucknellian Todd KrutchkofT '91, shown in action last year, is expected to provide senior leadership as well as offensive punch to the experienced Bucknell ice hockey squad.

A glance back at fall sports,"By Mark Abrahamsen Staff Writer Bucknell athletics experi enced a landmark fall season. For many sports, 1990 served as a year that will be cherished for quite some time. The past few months have been enjoyable to watch, and I offer the following perspective: Football The football class of 1991 will go down in school history as one of the more remarkable senior classes Bucknell has ever assem bled on the grass at Christy Mathewson-Memorial Stadium. Led by a bevy of veteran talent, the Bison rolled to a 5-1 start before concluding their year at 7-4. One continually had to look back in the record books during the stellar sea son, as the Bison were setting team marks that had not been duplicated in recent memory. This year's win ning season was the first for Buck nell since 1980. The Bison's seven victories marked the first time it had reached that plateau since 1964, when Bucknell last won the Lambert Cup. The two moments that will forever hold a place in this sports- writer's memoirs are Bucknell's clashes with Colgate and Lehigh. 1990 Homecoming provided a per fect setting for football, and the bat tle between the Bison and Red Raiders captured the essence of ath letic competition. Bucknell built a sizable first quarter lead, but Col gate mounted a formidable come back in the second half. Late in the game Bucknell scored to close the gap to 28-27. Without hesitation, Patriot League Coach of the Year Lou Maranzana went for the gutsy call and the two-point conversion. Despite the fact that the attempt failed, the Bison realized they had established themselves as a solid first-division member of the Patriot League. Perhaps the Game of the Year was when Bucknell came back from an 18-point fourth quarter def icit to defeat its most-hated rival, Lehigh, 30-27. The entire game was played in a driving rainstorm and biting wind, and the Bison exhib ited their true character by showcas ing a last-minute touchdown drive that provided more drama than Twin Peaks. Combined with Buck- nell's win at Bethlehem, PA in Week 2, the Bison defeated both Lafayette and Lehigh in the same season for the first time in 15 years. With eight All-Patriot League sen iors graduating this year, Maran zana has his work cut out for next season. Cross-country ""The Streak"" of Bucknell cross-country has been well- documented, as the Bison hadn't lost a dual-meet since October 5, 1974, but it ended abruptly Sept. 15 when Bucknell fell to Connecticut. The formidable ran ended at 167 consecutive wins, a mark that can be attributed to Head Coach Art Gulden's commitment to excel lence, and the year-in, year-out dedication to the program by Buck nell runners. Norbert Berenyi '91 led the Bison to victory in the inau gural Patriot League Champion ships, and Kelly Marsh '91 paced the women to a respectable season."

A meditation by Chaplain Hammerlee,"Men's soccer In a season that opened with many question marks, Head Coach Craig Reynolds seemed to find an answer, platooning Scott Racck '91 and Mark Wrigley '94 at goaltcndcr all season. The unselfish duo led the Bison to the Patriot League reg ular-season championship, as Buck nell tied a club record for season wins with 12. Ken Gulick '91 once again filled up opponents' nets with instant offense, and four-year letter- man Terry Pelino '91 concluded a fine career with a berth in the post season playoffs. Women's soccer Congratulations are in order for the women's soccer team, which finally attained varsity status after years of existence as a club sport at Bucknell. Though its first season was a tough struggle, the squad will likely improve each following year as interest and recruitment increase. Head Coach Toby Lovecchio's win ning personality and strong knowl edge of the game will help the Lady Bison build themselves into a prom inent team in the near future. Volleyball First-year Head Coach Cindy Opalski took over a volleyball pro gram that had been in shambles when she arrived. As players adjusted to a new coach and new attitude, players' sentiments have risen this season to a high level that should provide for better times down the road. Field Hockey Head Coach Jen Averill's field hockey team experienced an up-and-down season this fall. The Lady Bison proved that it could compete with just about every team it faced, and goaltender Danielle Ward '93 did a fabulous job keep ing Bucknell in the thick of many close battles. Freshman sensation Almira Baldwin '94 led this young squad, which figures to only get better with more experience work ing together as a cohesive unit. Women's tennis The women's tennis team posted another fabulous season for Head Coach Rose Ewan, compiling a record of 11-2 this fall behind a good mix of young and old at the six singles positions. Karen Stagli- ano '92 led the Lady Bison to a third-place finish at the Patriot 1 League Championships, as she rolled through opponents en route to the conference title at her #3 sin gles position."

/,"Water Polo Water polo again proved itself as one of Bucknell's more competitive sports, as the team con tinually squared off in tournaments pitting the Bison against the nation's best. Head Coach Lynn Kachmarik's 15-10 squad attained a ranking as high as #19 in the nation, and asserted itself as a dom inant team in the East. Polo fin ished fourth at the MAC Champi onships. Kevin Schroth '92 and John Zeigler '91 seemed to always deliver offensive punch when it was needed, and John Bradbury '92 was outstanding in the net all season. Golf Head Coach Tommy Thomp son's relatively inexperienced squad was inconsistent in the fall, as the Bison seemed to get up for certain meets while snooze through others. The team's highlight of the season was at the Georgetown Invi tational on Sept. 21 and 22, as the Bison averaged a score of 80 as a team. With more tournaments under their belts, the team com prised mostly of sophomores and freshmen will look to improve dur ing the spring. The fall of 1990 served as a stepping stone for many athletes and the last hurrah for many seniors who etched their final marks on the playing field. Overall Bucknell's athletic department can only be commended for its efforts and rela tionships with the students. Not only have coaches demonstrated good rapport with the athletes, but administrators have done a marve lous job as well. This fall Bucknell has witnessed many young men and women who have exhibited the capacity for the best of both worlds...the quintessential student- athlete."

...a look ahead,"By Darren Millman Staff Writer With the fall season having given way to the biting cold weather which typifies this time of year in central Pennsylvania, the Bucknell community can now turn towards the excitement of Bison winter sports in order to gain a slight reprieve from the elements. Men's basketball Prior to the beginning of the season, the prospects for the 1990- 91 men's basketball campaign seemed mediocre at best after the graduation of first team All-ECC players Greg Leggett (20.2 ppg, 6.1 rpg) and Mike Joseph (18.4 ppg, 6.3 apg). Now seven games into the young season, however, it appears Head Coach Charlie Woollum has done an impressive job restructur ing this less experienced group of players, as substantiated by the team's current 5-2 record. Woollum remarked, ""I'm very pleased with ihe team's progress up to this point. We've got a young team and I'd hope we would only continue to get better."" Now in the first season of competition in the Patriot League, Bucknell will have to overcome two new extremely formidable obstacles, Fordham and Holy Cross, in order to challenge for the title. The Brcakin' Bison will clash with St. Francis this Saturday at 7:30 p.m. in Davis Gym. Women's basketball Despite significant experi ence and talent, the Lady Bison basketball squad has failed to per form up to its potential thus far this season as the team is off to a disap pointing 0-5 start. Individually, forward and co captain Julie Bachman GR has excepted her role as a team leader, Wrestling The Bison grapplcrs enter the 1990-91 season with tremendous talent and potential. Currently ranked 27lh in the nation, Coach Bob Ferraro's squad has the ability to compete with the elite college wrestling programs in the country. Tom Marchctti '91, and Bryan Bums '91 lead an experi enced group which recently placed second to Bloomsburg at the James Madison Invitational tournament. An NCAA qualifier last sea son, Marchctti is the nation's sev enth-ranked wrestler at the 167-lbs. NCAA qualifier Bums is the 11th ranked competitor in the 190-lbs. weight class. Both have excellent chances to earn All-American honors. Chris Doukas '91 also a NCAA qualifier last season, is rock-solid at the 134-lbs. class. Other grapplers who will be depended on for large contributio- File photo/The Bucknellian Judging from the capacity crowds which have already crammed the stands of Davis Gym, the word has definitely circulated around campus that the new-look Brcakin' Bison are hard-working, talented and above all, extremely fun to watch. Led by the co-captain guard tandem of Bill Courtney '92 and Keith Fenton '91, the Bison thrive on a quick-paced transition offense, as well as a hounding pressure defense. Forward Mike Bright '93 anchors Bucknell's front court, while posing an offensive threat from both inside the paint as well as beyond the three-point line. Bright pounded the boards for a team leading 7.1 rebounds per game last season, and his ability to provide similar numbers this year is essen tial to the Bison's success. Other key contributor's to the team's early season success include center Paul Olkowski '93, forward Pat King '92, and guard Russell Peyton '93. Courtney currently leads the team in scoring with an average of 21.8 points per game."

The women enjoyed tremen dous success as well, including a record-setting day by Karen Shimo- mura '91. Shimomura took the 60- yard high hurdles in 8.2 seconds, .1 seconds faster than the previous fastest Bucknell time set in 1982. Tricia Plasko '92 placed her self second in the record books after winning the 60-yard dash in 7.1 seconds. Lynette McBride '91 won the long jump, while Jennifer Thomas '94 won the triple jump. The women who also won were Erin Ryan '93 in the 880, and Kris Dear- dorff '93 in the two-mile run. The indoor track team will host Shippensburg and Susque hanna this Saturday. Men's swimming and diving Men's swimming coach Dick Russell, has high hopes for his young yet talented Bison squad. According to Russell, the Bison lost 13 players from last sea son's ECC runner-up team to both graduation and lack of interest. Rus sell indicated that in order for the team to be successful this season, it is imperative that the freshmen per form like seasoned veterans. Although Bucknell dropped its first two meets of the season to UMBC and Colgate, several encour aging aspects were evident. Don Steenson '92 turned in victorious performances in both meets in the 200 meter backstroke with times which were impressive for so early in the season. Russell noted several swim mers whom he expected particularly good things from including Chad Farrell '92, Jay Gross '93, Rick Hutchinson '91, Marc Murphy '92, Kevin Schroth '92, and John Ziegler '91. Among the divers, Eric Carr '93 has performed well, winning the 1 -meter event at UMBC. As for the newcomers, Rus sell indicated that Dietrich Conze '94 was one of the finest freshman swimmers to come to Bucknell. The squad hosts LaSalle this Saturday in Rooke Pool at 1 p.m. Women's swimming and diving Confidence abounds as the women's swimming team enters the winter season. Now in their first Patriot League season, the women met the year's first task head-on as they edged conference opponent Colgate 132-110. Coach Lynn Kachmarik's squad returns 11 letter winners from last season's 6-4 group. In addition to all those experienced swimmers, the team is also com prised of 11 freshmen who will be looked to for immediate contributions. Margaret Grunow '93 is an extremely powerful swimmer, as File photo/The Bucknellian she showed in the Colgate meet after cruising to three individual victories. Other particularly strong swimmers include Andrea Falcione '92, Kathleen Harnett '94, Peggy Hovis '94, tri-captain Kelly Appier '91, tri-captain Carla Banashck '91, and Wendy Sheldon '93. Tri-captain Jodi Castallo '91 is an extremely competitive diver, and should lead the Lady Bison in that area. Bucknell will face LaSalle this Saturday at 1 p.m. in Rooke Pool. f r"

According to Zuckerburg, the team is expecting solid play from the upperclassmen. This includes Todd Krutchkoff, Pete Troost, John Guelcher and Randy Zultowski. The freshman appear strong as well, and Zuckerberg pre dicts strong results from them as they work their way through the Mason-Dixon league. They will face teams from Dickinson, Gettysburg, Blooms- burg, Georgetown and Johns Hop- kins, all of whom should be com petitive. The Bison will also be playing in non-league games against Gardner Construction and United Power, two teams from an in-town league to which they for merly belonged. The team expressed hopes that it can improve conditions for the spectators this season, as well. This will include a bus for fans to get to and from games. The Bison hockey team comes into the new season with a new look and a changed attitude. The squad hopes to intimidate teams with an aggressive style of play.

Breakin' Bison climb to 5-2 mark,
"Men's hoops tops Yale, Lycoming; foils to Fairfield","By Tommy Abel Staff Writer The Breakin' Bison improved their record to an impressive 5-2 as they trounced Lycoming (2-6) 97- 49 Wednesday night. This win gave Bucknell a 13-0 sweep in the now concluded series between these two teams. This was a game which fea tured no outstanding individual per formances, but rather a fantastic team effort. Three Bison broke into double figures in scoring, Mike Bright '93 with 11 points, Keith Fenton '91, 11 points, and Pat King '92, 10 points, while all 15 Bison broke double figures in minutes played. Head Coach Charlie Wool- lum commented, ""Last night was probably the easiest game we'll have by far. I was pleased with the way all the young players performed."" Peter Ho/The Bucknellian Co-captain Keith Fenton '91 evades a Yale defender as he drives for two of his 17 points during the Bison win. Fenton leads Bucknell in three-point field goals (made and percentage), and is the lone senior in the starting line-up. The Bison take on St. Francis of the Northeast Athletic Conference tomorrow in Davis Gym at 7:30 p.m. Bucknell was able to hold Lycoming to only 12 points while adding 48 of its own in the first half. The second half continued much the same as Lycoming was never able to get on track, shooting less than 30% from the field. The game served as a break for the Bison and as stated by Woollum, an excellent showcase of the younger, unseen talent on the team. Among the new contributors were Malt Clark '93 six points (2-5 from three-point land), Ray Brown '94 four points, one dunk, and Chris Simpson '94 six points and three assists. On Monday, a beleagured Bucknell team took on a pumped- up Fairfield University squad. From the opening tap the Stags took control holding the Bison to 46% shooting and outscoring them 47-37 in the first half. Positive spots for Bucknell were Bill Courtney '92 and Bright, who scored 14 and 10 points in the first period, respectively. Unfortu nately for the Bison the second half did not prove much better than the first. Bucknell shot 26% from the floor and was outscorcd by 17 points. Co-captain Courtney explained the outcome of the game stating,""I think it was just a case of us running out of gas."" Woollum agreed with Court ney's assessment stating, ""We had played six of the hardest games in a row we've ever played, and I think it finally wore us down."" On Saturday the Bison faced Yale (1-3), who was coming off a near upset of #15 UCONN. The Bulldogs were the pre-season pick to win the Ivy League, but that did not mean much when they played in front of a over-capacity Davis Gym crowd. The Breakin' Bisons started the game fast and furious going on an eight minute, 12-0 run. When the Bulldogs were finally able to pull it together it was too late Peter Ho/The Bucknellian Mike Bright '93 leaps skyward during the Bison's 72-63 victory over Yale last Saturday. Bright tallied 18 points in the winning effort. So far this season Bright has picked up right where he left off after last year's ECC All-Rookie campaign as a major contributor to Bucknell. because the Bison had jumped out to an 11 point, 34-23 halftime lead, behind the scoring of Bright and Fenton, both with 11 points. In the second half the Bison"

According to Courtney, ""A couple of times they got close but we pulled it out with tough defense like a team."" Courtney was instrumental in the team's impressive victory, netting 18 second half points to finish with a team high 21. Bright and Fenton followed with 20 and 17 points, respectively. ""We were in command pretty much from start to finish,"" explained Woollum. ""It was a good defensive effort."" The Bison will rap up their difficult pre-winter break schedule against Northeast Athletic Confer ence power St. Francis (PA). The Red Flash feature Playboy maga zines pre-season Academic All- America point guard Mike Iuzzo- lino, along with two other starters from last year's team. By Dave Riggs and Todd Bianchine Staff Writer The Bucknell women's bas ketball team, beaten twice this past week, will be searching for its first victory of the season when it squares off against Loyola, (Md.) tomorrow in Baltimore. Princeton traveled to Davis Gym last Satur day and held off a late rally by Bucknell to win 62-59, and St. Francis used a balanced attack to stop the visiting Lady Bison 89-83 on Tuesday. The losses drop Buck- nell's record to 0-5 this season, as the Lady Bison continue to struggle in close games. From the opening tip St. Francis took it to the Lady Bison, as the hosts jumped out to an 11-4 lead behind two three-point field goals from sharp-shooting guard Maureen Logan. Bucknell's Kelly Dec *94 then decided to show that she can deliver the long-range bomb as well, nailing 3 three- pointers to knot the score at 17-17 with 13 minutes remaining in the half. The two teams traded buckets for a while, and then St. Francis went on an 8-0 run, sparked by its center Vesna Drazetic, who tallied six points during the flurry. Buck nell was unable to respond with a run of its own, as the Lady Bison matched baskets with S l Francis for the rest of the half. Bucknell strolled to the locker room with a seven point deficit, 44-37. The first five minutes of the second half have proven to be a piv otal point all season for the Lady Bison, as they have either mounted strong comebacks or blown a big lead. This time neither happened, as the opening minutes were fruitless for both squads, with Bucknell only able to chop one point off St. Fran cis' halftime lead, making the score 53-47. The two teams continued to trade baskets throughout the remainder of the game, as Bucknell was only able to cut the lead to four at 77-73 with 3:27 left to play, with St. Francis sitting on top in the end 89-83. Once again Dee played strong for the Lady Bison, leading all scorers with 24 points. The Bucknell bench responded to Head Coach Lori Howard's call, as Juliet McGee '93 netted 10 points, while Heather Ross '94 and Anne McGovern '93 each had six off the pine. St. Francis mounted a bal anced attack, as it had six players scoring eight points or more. ""We couldn't get any momentum built up,"" said Dee. ""It wasn't one person in particular who killed us, I think it was more because we had trouble getting back on defense off the breaks."" It was a different story when Bucknell took on Princeton in Davis Gym last Saturday. Princeton came out firing with its big scorer, Julie Brackenridgc, out on the perimeter in the early going. She canned 11 points in the first seven minutes, helping Princeton open up a 19-8 lead. After a Bucknell time out, the Lady Tigers slowed the tempo and showed great patience against the Lady Bison zone. The tactic worked, allowing Princeton to build a 34-15 advantage with 6:10 left in the half. Bucknell then caught fire as reserve Monica Naw- arskas '94 put in four points, and center Kirsten Ellison '92 put in five of her own to cut the gap to nine at 37-28, to end the half with a"

Bucknell hopes to break into the win column tomorrow when it travels to face Loyola (MD.). 13-3 Lady Bison run. Bucknell came out of the gates strong for the second half, something it has had trouble doing in earlier games. Guards Caroline Shantz '91 and Joy Sandler '92 combined for eight points early to bring Bucknell within five of the Lady Tigers at 47-42 with 15 min utes remaining. Once again Brack- enridge was the answer for Prince- ton, scoring the next six points while holding the Lady Bison defense in check. Bucknell remained six to eight points down until they were able to cut the mar gin to four off a McGovern steal and basket with 3:16 left in regulation. Bucknell then pounded the See WOMEN'S HOOPS, page I7 Jamie Diaferia Staff Writer The Bucknell wrestling team finished second this past weekend in the James Madison Invitational tournament. The tournament was encouraging in that it produced two first-place and three second-place individual finishes. The excellent individual per formances by the Bison, however, were undermined by their disap pointing finish behind Bloomsburg, one of their main grappling rivals. The Bison went into the tour nament coming off a second-place finish to Bloomsburg in the Huskies own invitational tourna ment As a result Bucknell worked hard in hopes of redeeming itself in the second confrontation with Bloomsburg. Individually, co-captains Tom Marchetti '91 (167 lbs.) and Bryan Bums '91 (190 lbs.) both won their weight classes. Marchetti beat Tom Socker of Bloomsburg, while Bums defeated Brad Web ber, also of Bloomsburg, 11-3. Additionally, Marchetti was given the Outstanding Wrestling Award at the end of the tourna ment Ken Herceg '92 (177 lbs.), Chris Doukas '91 (134 lbs.), and Mike Van Doien '92 (142 lbs.) all finished second in the tourney. While Marchetti and Bums are currendy ranked seventh and eleventh in the nation for their respective weight classes, those standings could soon improve with the recent tournament Bums defeated Syracuse's Mark Kerr who is currently ranked eighth. Coach Ferraro was pleased with the Bison performance at JMU. While he felt that there were a few inconsistent matches, the team as a whole put in a good effort. According to Bums, the team had a lot to be happy about in terms of effort and results. ""We worked hard,"" he said. ""Of course we would have liked to have beaten Bloomsburg."" He added, though, that ""Bloomsburg is not a better team."" The Bison have a prolonged break until Jan. 11, when they face Millersvillc at home. As a result, the practice schedule has relaxed, with the team only wrestling on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. Following a meet against N.C. State on Jan. 12, the team will prepare for its trip to California on Jan. 17. The Bison wrestlers are hop ing that their success in the last two tournaments will give them the con fidence to perform well in the next phase of the season. Bums noted, ""We're a good team with a lot of talent. Right now we could compete with any team.'1 /"

Baghdad Radio announces,
Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait,
U.S. awaits concrete action; Iraqis rejoice in streets,"By Bob Ritter Staff Writer Baghdad Radio announced this morning that ""the Revolutionary Command Council has decided to accept United Nations Resolution 660, including Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait."" While the statement, which could signal the beginning of the end of the Gulf war, pledged the ""immediate and total cessation of all land, ground and sea action"" against the allied forces, it also called for the withdrawal of allied forces from Saudi Arabia, as well as an Israeli pullout from the West Bank and a possible Syrian withdrawal from Lebanon; it was unclear immediately whether these are hard conditions linked to the withdrawal. President George Bush, however, rejected the Iraqi overture, which he called ""a cruel hoax."" At the daily U. S. military briefing in Riyadh, Brigadier General Richard Neal announced, ""Our mission remains the same, and our forces will continue to execute that mission."" The radio announcement was met by relief and jubilation in Baghdad, as residents took to the streets and fired their weapons into the air in celebration. Allied forces, however, are more skeptical, and refuse to call a halt to the war until Iraqi troops begin to move. One Pentagon official quoted on the Cable News Network said he felt ""relief, not surprise, [but] let's wait and see."" The first official reaction to the announcement in Washington came from White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater, who read a statement this morning which said that while officials are still examining the proposal, ""it clearly contains conditions for Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait. Promises alone are not significant... [it] must be accompanied by concrete actions on the ground."" Bush was expected to stick to his planned schedule, visiting a Patriot missile factory in Massachusetts before traveling to Kennebunkport for the weekend. The announcement, which came over the air at 6:16 a.m. EST, sent Washington scrambling to interpret and analyze the statement, although the initial military reaction could be described as hopeful skepticism. Within an hour of the statement a British military spokesman announced that ""a mere verbal indication...would not be cause for stopping military operations."" United States military officials in Saudi Arabia said that ""nothing is changed until we hear from the commandcr-in-chief."" Reports from CNN correspondent Peter Arnett in Baghdad noted that even as citizens rejoiced in Baghdad, air raid sirens were sounded at about 7 a.m. EST. A pentagon official, estimating that 30 percent of Iraq's military capability has been destroyed in the month-long war, commented, ""If [Saddam Hussein] is serious, he did this at the point of a gun."""
"SPE fire causes $263,000",
"damage, destroys wing","By Tara Gilligan Staff Writer Students returned to the neatly repaired Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity house following the Dec. 13 fire which caused $263,000 damage. All 24 residents have returned to the house, although four students whose rooms were destroyed are living with friends until contractors complete repairs. The chapter's insurance covered approximately 80 percent of the loss but was not sufficient to cover the total cost of repairs due to depreciation. By the start of the spring semester, the house was essentially ready for its occupants. ""All the students were able to move into the house and into their rooms, except, I think, four students who lived on the first floor and those four weren't able to do so because the tile had not been laid in their rooms,"" said Gerry Commerford, assistant dean for housing. Several students who live upstairs have not been able to return to their rooms. The still unoccupied rooms need only minor repairs. The installation of built-in closets, shelves, and desks is not complete. Also, contractors still have to paint the rooms. Room repairs should be complete within three weeks. In the meantime, the students fpreed out of these rooms are living in other rooms within the house. Students moved into rooms occupied by only one fraternity member. ""In no case have we overcrowded any of the rooms,"" said Jim Orbison, SPE's faculty adviser and associate professor of civil engineering. Contractors have made final repairs to the living room, which Colin Bridgewater/The Bucknellian The fire, which started in the top right room pictured above, destroyed four rooms in the house and caused extensive damage to several others. was open for general use Wednesday. Just days after the fire, which started when a candle fell onto a mattress, CVC contractors began repairing the building. 'They had to remove about half of the roof straight down to the second floor ceiling,"" said Orbison. See FIRE, page 2"

Jenks proposes severing,
of university ties to ROTC,
"Faculty requests public fora, delays vote on motion","By Mark Leister Staff Writer Monday's faculty meeting ended with the postponement of a motion to sever ties with the University's Army Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) program. The delay hinged on the faculty's majority opinion that public fora should be conducted before any final policy decisions are made. George Jenks, collection development librarian and author of the motion, based his proposal on two primary principles. First, the University's non-discriminatory policy conflicts with the U.S. military's discrimination on gender and sexual orientation; second, the mission of the armed forces is ""to kill other human beings and destroy property"" -- principles often interpreted as incongruent with the University's mission. For these reasons, Jenks has proposed the complete severing of ties with the Army ROTC program as soon as legally possible. Jenks' motion also concerns the University'smonetary link to the ROTC program. Jenks explained that Bucknell should not ""go whoring m i' 4E E"

"Weddle, Greaves step down",
from administrative positions,"By Mark Abrahamsen and Darren Millman Staff Writers Two Bucknell administrators, Associate Vice President for Student Life Charlotte Jacobsen Weddle and Vice Presidentfor Academic Services and Planning Thomas Greaves, have announced their intentions to pursue other career interests after this semester. Weddle Weddle, currendy in her fifth year at Bucknell, described her decision to leave as ""the chance to spread my wings outside the realms of higher education."" Over the last two semesters, a University committee thoroughly has evaluated Weddle's performance. The committee issued its final report to President Sojka last summer. In addition to members from the student body, faculty, and administration, the evaluation committee included administrators at frame-of-reference schools who had experience in positions like Weddle's. Although Weddle explained that she has not seen all of the evaluation reports, she stated that the process took several months longer than expected. When asked if the evaluation process affected her decision to change careers, Weddle responded, ""My own agenda changed during the time period of the evaluation. The predominant impact was what is going to be the best foundation for a long-term relationship between my husband and myself, and where we can each have career opportunities."" Weddle is planning to relocate in North Carolina, and she labels the move a ""joint enterprise"" with her husband. She finds her options limitless, but hints that human resources management could be part of her future. ""I've really wanted to do consulting, and working with organizations,"" commented Weddle. While she has accepted a nomination to compete for the vice presidency at another prestigious university, no final decision has been made. She has also entertained the thought of returning to the classroom. During her tenure at Bucknell, Weddle made major changes within the division of student life. From the outset, she recognized that the division was ""grossly understaffed."" Bucknellian File Photo Thomas Greaves will be leaving his position as vice president of academic services and planning in order to assume the role of full time professor of anthropology. Greaves has been in an administrative role at Bucknell for nearly four years. Since then, she has worked to improve communication between students and administrators.

Fire,
------,"From page 1 The fire completely destroyed four rooms, according to Orbison. Six windows had to be replaced and ""the rest of the structure suffered water and smoke damage,"" said Orbison. Because SPE is a privately owned fraternity, the university did not pay for repairs. ""We have insurance on the structure and on the chapter contents,"" said Orbison. Due to depreciation, the insurance will not cover the entire bill for repairs. The fraternity will need a loan to cover 20 percent of the repair costs. Orbison said he has had a ""verbal agreement"" from the national chapter to supply the balance in the form of a loan. To pay off the loan, SPE may have to consider remortgaging its house. Individuals in the upstairs rooms, hardest hit by the fire, lost all of their personal belongings. According to John Ambrose '93, who occupied the room where the fire originated, seven students ""lost everything"" in the fire. ""Hopefully home ow ners insurance will cover it,"" Ambrose said. The William Cameron Engine Company has distributed copies of the fire report to students planning to claim damages incurred in the fire. ""Most of the brothers of SPE took copies of that report and used it to fill claim s for their home ow ners insurance,"" said Safety Manager Jim McCormick. College students are often covered by their parents' home owners insurance. Although the construction company worked through January, when most students left campus, the fire caused initial problems which had to be dealt with during finals week. Following the fire the University provided members of SPE with alternative housing across campus and meals in the cafeteria. Fire engines arrived at the scene at 8:35 a.m. on December 13 after ""a smoke detector in the hallway of SPE was activated"" and alerted dispatchers at the 'security office, said McCormick. Upon his arrival at approximately 8:30 Steve Chene, William Cameron assistant fire chief and Weis Center technical director, called for more trucks to fight the blaze which had already broken through the roof. In total, eight area f  re com pan ies responded to the three alarm fire. The fire, which destroyed many of the upstairs fraternity rooms, began as a smoldering mattress. The fire report attributed the start to a fallen candle. Tim Peterson, one of several residents who smelled smoke an hour before the arrival of fire engines, discovered the smoldering mattress and attempted to extinguish it. ""I went upstairs and the whole hallway was just filled with smoke, and I went up in the loft where the mattress was and it wasn't a fire,"" said Peterson. Peterson poured water on the mattress and, assuming the fire to be out, left for swim practice. ""I poured a pitcher of water over it and just thought it would be fine because all the embers were out and any kind of sparks were out,"" he said. According to one firefighter on the scene, a mattress can smolder for a long time before actually igniting. ""You can throw an ember in a mattress. It'll smolder for hours before it ignites. W hile it's smoldering it won't produce any smoke,"" he said. As soon as the fire was discovered, security evacuated the building. Residential Life staff members conducted a head count in which all but one individual was immediately accounted for; they soon learned, however, that the one unaccounted for student had left campus. The fire destroyed the contents of five rooms on the second floor of the house and three other rooms suffered major smoke damage. Losses of first floor contents came in the form of water damage. The section in which the fire began is a relatively new addition to the house, built about fifteen years ago. A fire wall, originally the outer wall of the house, still separates the addition from the main part of the house. ""None of us knew that brick wall was up there... so everyone was concerned that the fire was going to spread from that portion of the building into the center part and work its way over. However, that wall, the brick wall, is the thing that stopped the fire from spreading,"" said McCormick. Had it not been for the wall, damage would likely have been far more extensive, according to McCormick. The fact that SPE is not a university owned fraternity did not keep faculty from assisting students living in the house. ""The connecting thread is they're our students, regardless of where they live, they're our students so we think of our obligation as one to people, to students, and not to where they live,"" said Dean of Students, John Dunlop. Dunlop also pointed out that the university was under no legal obligations to provide help for the SPE students. Most students driven out of the SPE house resided for the rest of the fall term with friends off campus. Those who had no place to stay lived in the fifth floor of Trax Hall. The University provided students with meals during the final week of the semester. In addition, the bookstore gave members of SPE a 25 percent discount on supplies. The deans of both colleges worked with students to deal with problems arising because students' books burned in the fire. ""We were going to get them books, but the textbooks are sent back several weeks after a class starts so we didn't have any books left over,"" said Dunlop. The bookstore did arrange to borrow books from suppliers for some of the students. Other fraternities also helped the SPE students find places to live and eat ""Some of the fraternities offered to let the burned-out SPE's have their meals there and I think for the first couple of days those SPE's did have breakfast, lunch, and supper at several fraternities,"" said Dunlop. iv '-  )!

ROTC--,"From page 1 Susquehanna Valley. Major John Crafton of the ROTC military science department stated that of the approximately 60 Bucknell students enrolled in the ROTC program, more than 40 receive yearly scholarships worth well over $12,000 each. Larry Shinn, vice president for academ ic affairs, sees these scholarships as an integral part of ""the total financial aid picture,"" since ROTC's removal would represent a yearly budgetary burden of over $500,000. The faculty's vote to delay the decision, however, demonstrates their unwillingness to recommend a curricular change without full knowledge of the ramifications. William Becker, department chair and professor of religion, agrees with the decision to suspend action on the motion until public fora can be held. Becker stated that he hopes for a ""cross-fertilization"" of ideas with ""thoughtful discussion of the perspectives of the faculty"" as well as of ""the legal implications"" of the motion. A decision to remove Bucknell's Army ROTC program would have both local and national ramifications. Established in 1951 with the charge of educating and training future military leaders, Buckneli's program has achieved prominence as the ""east coast's outstanding small school program."" Public forums on the ROTC issue will be held this month so that the motion can be raised for a final vote at the March 4 faculty meeting."

100 compact discs stolen,
from student mail room,"By Steve Hoerter Staff Writer Approximately 100 compact discs and an undetermined number of cassette tapes were stolen from the Student Mail Room in the Langone Center early this month in what, Jim Muchler, director of administrative services, has termed an ""unfortunate incident."" According to reports issued by the Department of Security and Safety, employees reported the discs and tapes missing at 11 a.m. February 4. Following a search of the area, by employees and officers from Security and Safety, four empty cardboard boxes, which the discs and tapes were reportedly stored in, were discovered stashed under a counter in the mailroom. East Buffalo Township Police were called to the scene and the United States Postmaster in Lewisburg was notified of the incident. According to Vincent DcCerchio, director of security and safety, ""The incident's under investigation at this time, we believe it's an internal theft and we have some leads."" DeCerchio said that the area ""has been secured. Locks have been rekeyed and an alarm system has been installed to prevent any future attempted theft from the mailroom."" He added that area merchants, including the University Bookstore, ""have been notified of the thefts and have been advised to be on the lookout"" for anyone attempti ng to sell or return the stolen discs and tapes. Employees in the mailroom refused to comment on the incident, and directed all questions to Muchler, who is in charge of student mail services. Amid speculation that U.S. postal inspectors would be involved in the investigation, Muchler, in an interview Wednesday, stated that ""...the student mailroom is the equivalent of any institulion'sccntral mailroom."" He added, ""It is not a chartered post office like the one located in Marts Hall,"" therefore it does not fall under federal jurisdiction. Approximately 39studcntsarc believed to be victims of the theft. According to Muchler, ""We have 39 names, two of those share [mail] boxes -- we don't know for certain which of the 4 students would have been the receiver's [of the discs or tapes]."" He added that the list is ""rough"" and not wholly accurate. M uchler said that the University ""would like to offer any assistance to the students that we can; as much help as we can provide them to resolve the issue as quickly as possible."" He said that the compact disc companies involved were being contacted in the hope that they might be able to more specifically identify the victims of the theft Addressing the changes in mailroom procedure, Muchler said, ""We don't want to create a system of hassle. The policies we've invoked as a result, it is hoped, will not hamper the service of the mailroom. Students certainly don't need the hassle; hopefully with the measures we've taken, we won't see a repeat of the incident."""

SPORT,
SPREE,
OUTLET,"By Bob Ritter Staff Writer Despite the war in the Persian Gulf and the increased fears of terrorism both at home and abroad, Bucknell students studying abroad have been little-affected, according to Barbara Rowe, director of off- campus studies. She said that only four of the 103 Bucknell students scheduled to go abroad, or four percent, chose to drop out following the outbreak of Svar. Some January programs, however, were affected by the conflict Rowe said that the crisis did not catch her office off guard because off-campus studies departments across the U.S. have been ""talking about how to handle the situation since early November, [and] every program has contingency plans in place."" In addition, she said ""most programs have beefed up security,"" and have included lessons to students on how to behave prudently, by avoiding traveling alone or standing out as an American. There have been isolated incidents of threats to programs, specifically in Florence, Italy, but Rowe said that ""many [programs] have had [only] minimal withdraws."" Rowe said that applications for off-campus studies constituted ""one of ourhighestsemesters,"" noting that those applications were due before the Gulf crisis began. She added, ""most students arc going ahead as planned"" with applications for the fall semester. Although some students have been nervous about making such plans, Rowe summarized, ""I personally would encourage students to go ahead; we should all have a wait-and see-attitude."" While traditional off-campus studies have experienced only minor disruptions, tensions from the Persian Gulf war caused the students in one January program to cut short their stay in Europe. The eleven students in the ""Exploring the Alps"" program in Austria, who were accompanied by Tom Travis, professor of political science, had the option of returning on Jan. 20 or traveling for a week before returning on the 27th. According to Stephanie Cohen '92, one of the students on the trip, the entire party chose to return early because they ""heard it was difficult to cross borders,"" rendering their travel plans more difficult. She said anti-American feelings ""were not too much of a threat in the ski towns."" But the group did encounter anti-war protestors in Munich. ""We didn't like to be out in public a lot,"" she said. Cohen concluded that the increased tensions made the journey ""kind of scary but really exciting to be there at the same time."" Travis said that the class had discussed contingency plans earlier in the month, and following the fifteenth Travis said that he ""suggested generally that they might want to think about coming home,"" but that he ""didn't push"" the issue. However, after many parents contacted the students and Travis spoke to Barbara Shailor, January program coordinator, he advised students to leave, telling them, ""In a state of uncertainty it was best to be prudent."" Both Cohen and Travis said that there were many cancellations on their return flight to the U.S., as many Europeans put off plans to travel here following the beginning of the war. By Bob Ritter Staff Writer Temperatures arc scheduled to drop into single digits tonight and rise only into the teens tomorrow, accompanied by high winds, a combination which can cause a significant danger of frostbite on skin exposed to the elements for only a short time. According to Owen Anderson, professor of physics, the wind chill factor, an index which measures the temperature felt on the skin, could be between 15 and20degrcesFahrenhcil below zero tomorrow, due to winds between twenty and thirty miles per hour. He said that the wind chill overnight tonight could reach as low as 40 degrees below zero. Anderson explained that exposed flesh may freeze within one minute in wind chills below minus 25. Dr. J. Preston Hoyle, director of medical services, explained that ""a cold injury is much like a bum,"" and stressed the importance of ""being very careful to cover exposed skin and take the proper steps"" if frostbite occurs. In such cases, Hoyle recommends ""slow, gentle warming, something which encourages circulation, but not rapid heat,"" as well as seeking prompt medical attention. Hoyle also explained that alcohol consumption can cause greater risk of a cold injury, since ""it dilates blood vessels and one might feel very warm--that's a false thing."" Since the intoxicated person ""spends body heat very quickly, when that stageends you're more likely to have a cold injury."" He also noted the increased risk because the intoxicated person may not be aware of the potential danger or the precautions which should be taken.

U.S. bomb hits,
Iraqi civilians,"Iraq has claimed that two bombs dropped Wednesday from an American Stealth bomber landed in a reinforced concrete building housing hundreds of Iraqi civilians. Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz claimed 400 civilians died in the bombing. Later reports, however, indicated that the bombing killed as few as 65 civilians. American officials said they targeted the structure, because of evidence that it had been converted into a military command and control center. Iraq claims the installation had been a longtime civilian air raid shelter. Officials also said that Iraq may have purposely allowed civilians to use the building knowing that it was a likely target for U .S. bombing. In a televised appearance, White House Spokesman Marlin Fitzwatcr said Saddam Husscin"" timc and again, has showed a willingness tosacrificecivilian lives and property that further his war aims."" The attack has invoked considerable controversy within the Bush Administration, which insisted from the start of the war on accurately bombing only military targets. Bush has expressed a wish to spare civilian lives. The possible 400 civilian deaths would represent the largest single day casualty list since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on August 2. Baghdad officials have reported the deaths of 600 civilians in the four weeks of war. The American coalition faces strains within the allied alliance and possible pressures to hasten the start of ground war."
Chinese issue,
harsh sentence,"Two democracy advocates arrested during the Tiananmen protests received 13-year prison sentences by a Chinese court The sentences, which came Tuesday, arc the longest o f any announced in connection to the demonstrations of April, May, and June 1989. The trials seemed to be an attempt by the government to place responsibility for the entire uprising on only two men, Wang Juntao and Chen Ziming. The official New China News Agency broadcast that the two men "" wantonly incited some persons to subvert people's government and socialist system, gathered together some illegal organizations in Beijing and conducted a scries of activities to subvert the people's government."" Despite China's apparent attempt to use Wang and Chen as a warning to Chinese people,diplomats said the nation may view the men as national heroes. One Western diplomat said it was ""an absurdity"" that the Chinese government would attempt to place the entire burden of the Tiananmen incident of two individuals."

Japan reports,
nuclear mishap,"The company which operates the Minami nuclear power plant in Japan revised its accounts of a major weekend accident in which ""a small amount"" of radiation escaped into the atmosphere. The company now admits that workers waited 50 min utes before shutting down the plant The delays in plant shut down occurred because workers believed that the gauge showing increased radioactivity in a cooling chamber was registering false readings. Not long after the workers did begin reducing power, an emergency shutdown system proven ted a nuclear meltdown by injecting water into the core of the reactor. Japanese officials had said earlier that plant operators acted withouthesitation and that no nuclear fuel escaped. Reversal o f the statement may be an embarrassment to the government, which has plans to double its nuclear power capacity. Officials claimed a breach in tubes carrying water from the nuclear core was the probable cause o f the accident. Radioactive water leaked during the accident contaminating the water in the steam generator."
USAir lays off,
employees,"U SA ir, Inc. announced on Monday its plans to eliminate 3585 employees from its workforce, a decrease o f approximately six percent. The cuts, which include the dismissal o f 660 pilots, are the airline's attempts to deal with high fuel prices and a slumping travel industry. In addition the airline, one of the largest major carriers not planning to seek bankruptcy protection, will reduce its number of flights each day by 286 to 2,626. The east coast will be primarily affected, though flights will be cut in the west as well. British Airw ays also announced plans to elim inate employees. A  slow travel business caused by the war in the gulf forced British Airways to cut its workforce by 8.8 percent, a lay-off of 4600 employees. An additional 3.5 percent of its employees at half pay will lose their jobs. Many of the top airlines have had to take drastic measures in an attempt to survive the lag in travel business. Last week Pan American World Airways, operating under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code, revealed its intentions to reduce its workforce by 15 percent. British Airways, hoping to promote international travel, announced a 33 percent drop in the cost of a round trip ticket between the United States and Britain."
Wall St. rallies in,
wake of war,"A rally on Wall Street, the biggest since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, took place early this week. Trading was heavy and the Dow Jones Industrial Average reached its high point for the year, leaping 71.54 points, or 2.5 percent to 2,902.23. Since the start of the war on Jan. 17, the Dow has risen over 15 percent. Stock prices began rising in the early days of fighting and never receded, as in the days leading up to war. A sputtering economy, inflated oil prices, and the possibility of war had, for a time, caused stock prices to drop, but it now appears they arc on the rebound. By theeveof the war, the Dow, had dropped to2508.91. By Monday, the Dow closed at 2902.23 and showed signs o f continuing an upward trend. The sudden jump in trading seems also to indicate growing confidence in actions taken by the Federal Reserve Board to lower interest rates. The move is an attempt to pull the economy out o f its recession."
Bakker will get,
new sentence,"A federal appeals court Tuesday called for the resentencing of televangelist Jim Bakker,claiming that the original sentence of 45 years imprisonment was influenced by the biases of the judge, as indicated by comments made during the sentencing procedure. The three judges sitting on the United States Court of Appeals panel for the Fourth Circuit upheld the conviction Bakker faces on 24 charges of conspiracy and fraud. The charges came when Bakker bilked his followers out of $158 million, some of which he used to support his own lavish lifestyle. The next step, according to one of Bakker's lawyers, will be a hearing in Charlotte, N .C . to establish a resentencing date. Sources did not say whether the resentencing would result in a shorter sentence."
Brown expels,
student,"Brown University has expelled a student who violated an anti- harrassment rule by shouting racial epithets. The expulsion of Douglas Hann is the first of its kind at Brown, and it is possibly the first such expulsion in the nation. The university' s Under graduate Disciplinary Council found Hann, a junior, to have violated a ruling put into effect in the fall of 1989. Hann's "" hate crime"" was shouting anti-black, anti-Semitic, and anti-homosexual slurs in acourtyard. He was also under the influence of alcohol at the time. The incident was Hann's second violation including racial epithets. Neither the American Council on Education nor the American Civil Liberties Union, both organizations that follow campus hate crimes, knew of any other student expelled for similar actions. Hann did not deny the incident, but said ""I think it was just a political statement by the university."" Nearly two years prior to the incident, Hann attended a race relations workshop and counsel for alcohol abuse as punishment for aiming racial slurs toward a student at a fraternity bar."
Two named to,
alumni relations,"Dennis Banas and Kimberly Babcock have accepted positions at Bucknell in university and alumni relations. Banas, newly-hired director of major gifts, will plan, organize, and implement efforts by the university to secure capital gifts from alumni, parents and friends. Before beginning work in February, Banas was formerly the director of development at James Madison College, part of the Michigan State University system. Banas has also served as assistant to the director of the Michigan State University School of Criminal Justice. Babcock, a 1989 Bucknell graduate, was named assistant director of alumni relations in January. She will oversee the special events, including the Homecoming program, and will be staff coordinator for several Bucknell alumni clubs in the northeast. Bankers United named Babcock oncof its top ten salespersons in the nation for 1990."
TKE sponsors,
hazing lecture,"Eileen Stevens, founder of the Committee to Halt Useless College Killings (CHUCK), will lecture on Tuesday, Feb. 19 at 8 p.m. in the Weis Center. Stevens, whose son was killed during a hazing incident, will speak about the dangers of hazing. The lecture, "" Death by Hazing,"" is open to the public. Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity is sponsoring the lecture."
Bucknell plans,
war discussion,"Bucknell will host a public discussion of the Persian Gulf war on Sunday, Feb. 17 at 1 p.m. in Vaughan Literature Auditorium. The discussion will focus on the events leading up to the war. Faculty of the political science, econom ics and geography departments will give presentations at the discussion.

Administration,"From page 1 Greek life, improvements in resident assistant training, acting as an advocate for both women and gay/ lesbian student groups, and contributing to the community of Lewisburg. Looking back on her stay at the University, Weddle assessed, "" I generally have a sense that I do good work. President Sojka has always told me I have. I've never received any negative feedback, and I have always been well regarded."" Referring to the nature of her position, W eddle continued, "" Student affairs is a wonderful job, but also a killer. I believe my body needs a change."" Weddle leaves Bucknell at a time when she believes the University is on the upswing. 'There is a vitality on campus now that I feel has changed in my time here,"" she said. "" Students can find many different ways to make friends and be active rather than thinking there's only one way--the Greek life."" Nevertheless, isolated incidents have brought Weddle difficult times in recent years. "" Act 31 and the faculty vote [to abolish the Greeks] were body blows. The FUI-DU fight had one of the most profound negative impacts on the campus. That was one of the main instigators for the faculty vote."" Greaves Greaves leaves his post as vice- president after four years, but he will continue to be an integral part of the campus community as he assumes the role o f full-time professor of anthropology. "" It is with substantial relief that I will be able to focus all of my efforts into teaching,"" said Greaves. "" My first love is anthropology."" Greaves said a number of factors influenced his decision to step down, including the factthatBucknell is in the process o f reducing expenditures. ""I think the University itself is encountering more challenging financial situations than it has in the past,"" explained Greaves. ""We are going to have to reduce our spending in several areas, and as the president has indicated, and I certainly agree with him , the size o f the administration at the University is also going to have to be reduced."" Greaves was quick to stress that the administration's financial woes are minor compared to those at many other universities. President Sojka has asked Barbara Shailor, current special assistant to the president, to assume a yet-to-be-created vice-presidential position that will fuse many o f the responsibilities previously handled by both Weddle and Greaves. In addition tocurrently serving as special assistant, Shailor also heads Bucknell's Affirmative Action and Jan Plan programs. One of Shailor's most positive attributes is her strong ability to accept suggestions and advice from others. Shailor said, "" I want to hear what people have to say, and will be guided by their experience."""

"Asst. Professor of Music,",
"Lois Svard, to debut in NY","By Maria Glod Lois Svard, assistant professor of music, at Bucknell, will have her New York recital debut on Wednesday, Feb. 20, at 8 p.m. in Merkin Concert Hall at the Abraham Goodman House. Svard has received international acclaim for her performances of contemporary piano music. This recital will include the New York premiers of works by American experimental composers Jerry Huntand""Blue""GeneTyranny. Svard worked personally with the composers of many of the pieces she will perform. In 1989, producer and performer Tyrrany composed ""Nocturne With and Without Memory"" for her. In addition to playing ""Nocturne,"" Lois will perform ""Imaginary Dance,"" a piece written for her by Bucknell Professor of Music William Duck worth, as well as works by European composers Hans Otte and Gyorgy Ligeti. ""A lot of musicians are afraid to take a chance on a new piece,"" Svard said. ""I find it exciting to perform works that have never been played before and to have a chance to work on these pieces with the composers."" A native of Minnesota, Svard began her musical training at age five. She studied at the University of Colorado in Boulder and recently received a Doctor of Musical Arts in piano performance from the Peabody Institute of the Johns Hopkins University. She taughtatthc Eastman School of Music in Rochester, NY and has been at Bucknell for the past six years.

For more than a decade they have entertained audiences throughout the world. Many people like the radical approach their new vocalic sounds and massive sound system bring to their performance. A highlight of this concert will be a collaboration with the Rooke Chapel Choir for Benjamin Britten's ""A Hymn to the Virgin."" ""I'm excited about it,"" said William Payn, director of the choir. ""It is a great experience for the choir to participate with a vocal group."" The performance marks the end of Electric Phoenix's short residency hercat Bucknell. The group's artistic director, Terry Edwards, conducted workshops this week dealing with the musical trends of the twentieth- century. Students were given hands- on time with the group's electronic equipment. Electric Phoenix will also be performing a piece composed by music professor William Duckworth entitled ""Songs of the Pale Horseman."" This work, which explores the subject of death, is written in nine short scenes varying from song-like to dramatic. The four singers, mezzo- soprano Meriel Dickinson, soprano Judith Rees, tenor Daryl Runswick, and bass Terry Edwards, along with sound engineer John Whiting, have produced three albums. The first, released in 1982, was voted ""Record of the Year"" by London's Sunday Times. Tickets are still available through the Weis Center Box Office (xlOOO) and also at the door.

Butas he mentioned to his writing class, he is excited to begin working with writers at Bucknell. Courtesy of Public Relations Bucknell's Poet-in-Resldence, Louis Simpson."
Bloomsburg Theatre Ensemble,
presents,
Candida,
thru Feb. 24,
G.B Show's romantic comedy is a delight for oil,"By Laura Grisln Do your horizons need expanding? Have you not been satisfied with Lewisburg's cultural offerings? Perhaps you should consider a night on the town in Bloomsburg with the Bloomsburg Theatre Ensemble (BTE) and their latest production, George Bernard Shaw's Candida. As the third production in the BTE's ""Faces of Comedy"" season, Candida explores the relationships between men and women and, specifically, how men's idealization of women is the female race's biggest obstacle in their quest for equality. Shaw presents a humorous love story set in late nineteenth- century London. James, an energetic, genial parson and popular orator, perceives himself to be the master of his house and his wife. Candida, whom he has placed high on a pedestal. As Shaw explains, however, he is really ""a great baby"" because as James competes for her attention with Eugene, a shy, fragile 18-year-old poet, we see that Candida is truly the master of this house. Shaw once stated that he wrote Candida as a response to Henrik Ibsen's A Doll's House, because in his experience ""...in the real typical Doll's House it is the man who is the Doll."" Indeed, this play is a delight for men and women alike. Though the Bloomsburg Theatre Ensemble has acquired national acclaim, few Bucknellians are even aware of its existence. A definite exception is 1990 Bucknell graduate Jonathan Uffelman who is currently an intern with the BTE. Also, ensemble member Laurie McCants is currently teaching beginning theatre classes here at Bucknell. Later this month the BTE's Theatre in the Classroom tour will begin its thirteenth year by taking Land of the Rising Sun to schools in the Philadelphia area. In June, BTE actors leave for Africa to conduct discussions and workshops in American embassies. In the meantime, however, the BTE will finish out its ""Faces of Comedy"" season in Bloomsburg with Candida through Feb. 24, Tennessee Williams' OutCry (Mar. 21-Apr. 7),andGeorgesFeydeau's 13 Rue de LAmour (May 2-25). Performances are Thursdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m. and Sundays at 3 p.m. at the Alvina Krause Theatre, 226 Center Street, Bloomsburg. Tickets are $12 Thursday, Friday, Sunday, and $ 14 Saturday. Student and seniorcitizcn tickets are half-price. For ticket info call the theatre box office at 784- 8181."

Issues Versus Motives,
"ROTC Fulfills ""Diverse Education"" Criteria","M onday's faculty meeting w as filled with the conflict between the ideals of a liberal arts education and the dem ands of our society. The issue of abolishing Bucknell's ties to the ROTC program , when considered in the context of the Gulf crisis, should have provoked an open and spirited debate among our faculty. However, a current of anti-war sentiment appeared to be underlying this new movement toward a break from the ROTC program, and some members of the faculty were more interested in m aking an im m ediate and symbolically weighted statement against the w ar than with carefully weighing the m otion's ramifications. The most compelling argum ent made by those in favor of severing all ties w ith ROTC asserts that the program  discrim inates on the basis of gender and sexual orientation, practices in direct conflict with the University's express non-discrimination policy. George Jenks, author of the motion, also claims that the sole objective of m ilitary courses is to teach students to kill people and destroy property. While it is true and necessary that the courses include those lessons, students are also taught discipline, assertiveness, and leadership skills. Jenks' narrow  scope also fails to consider the need for an adequate defense in today's world society, consisting of well-educated officers and soldiers. Abolishing one of the A rm y's finest ROTC program s w ould clearly be a step in the opposite direction. Finally, the severing of ties with ROTC would have a devastating effect on Bucknell's financial aid program. While the need for financial assistance m ay appear to some as a dependence on ""tainted monies,"" it is nonetheless a very im portant practical consideration and one which w e cannot ignore. Merit-based scholarships are few and far-between, and their retention at Bucknell is of the utm ost importance to many. One further point to ponder: m any assert that the military courses are incongruent with Bucknell's focus on providing a liberal arts education. Is this not directly contradictory to common sense? By definition, a liberal arts education should include exposure to m any diverse perspectives and values. By deem ing the values of ROTC to be ""inappropriate,"" there appears to be a squelching of the very ideals of liberal arts education. A vote by the faculty to eliminate the ROTC program  would be a slap in the face to the true principles of a liberal education, eliminate one of the University's strongest leadership curricula and result in dire financial aid consequences for the University. Most im portantly, ROTC should not become a paw n to further the anti-war objectives of the faculty."

TO  (tm),
President Bush justifies,
U.S. role in Persian Gulf,"Presidential Letter to College Students: If armed men invaded a home in this country, killed those in their way, stole what they wanted and then announced the house was now theirs--no one would hesitate about what must be done. And that is why we cannot hesitate about what must be done halfway around the world: in Kuwait. There is much in the modem world that is subject to doubts or questions--washed in shades of gray. But not the brutal aggression of Saddam Hussein against a peaceful, sovereign nation and its people. It's black and white. The facts are clear. The choice unambiguous. Right vs. wrong The terror Saddam Hussein has imposed upon Kuwait violates every principle of human decency. Listen to what Amnesty International has documented. ""Widespread abuses of human rights have been perpetrated by the Iraqi forces... arbitrary arrest and detention without trial of thousands... widespread torture... imposition of the death penalty and the extrajudicial execution of hundreds of unarmed civilians, including children."" Including children. There's no horror that could make this a more obvious conflict of good vs. evil. The man who used chemical warfare on his own people - once again including children - now oversees public hangings of dissenters. And daily his troops commit atrocities against Kuwaiti citizens. This brutality has reverberated throughout the entire world. If we do not follow the dictates of our inner moral compass and stand up for human life, then his lawlessness will threaten the peace and democracy of the emerging New World order we now see: this long dreamed-of vision we've all worked toward for so long. A year after the joyous dawn of freedom's light in Eastern Europe, a dark evil has descended in another part of the world. But we have the chance, and we have the obligation, to stop ruthless aggression. I haye been in war. I have known the terror of combat. And I tell you this with all my heart: I don't want there to be a war ever again. I am determined to do absolutely everything possible in the search for a peaceful resolution to this crisis-- but only if the peace is genuine, if it rests on principle, not appeasement. But while we search for that answer, in the Gulf young men and women are putting their own lives on hold in order to stand for peace in our world and for the essential value of human life itself. Many are younger than my own children. Your age, most of them. Doing tough duty for something they believe in. Let me tell you about one of the soldiers over there, S.F.C. Terry Hatfield, a young man from Georgia. He sent me a Christmas card. And this is what he wrote. ""Mr. President, I just wanted you to know my soldiers and I are ready to do whatever mission you decide. Freedom as we know and enjoy has been taken away from another country and must be restored. Although we are separated from family, friends, loved ones, we will do what must be done.... We stand ready and waiting. God Bless you and the U.S.A."" Terry understands the moral obligation that has compelled our extraordinary multi-national coalition to make this stand in the Gulf. To look this international terrorist straight in the eye and say: no concessions. To proclaim for now and the future: no compromises. To bear witness by our presence to the fact that aggression will not be rewarded. Terry waits thousands of miles from the White Hose, yet we share the same thoughts. We desperately want peace. But we know that to reward aggression would be to end the promise of our New World Order. To reward aggression would be to destroy the United Nation's promise as international peacekeeper. To reward aggression would be to condone the acts of those who would desecrate the promise of human life itself. And we will do none o f this. There are times in life when we confront values worth fighting for. This is one such time. See BUSH, p. 10"
Parent urges Sojka to,
"limit activities of S.T.O.P,","Dear Dr. Sojka, I am writing to appeal to you to take a firm stand in front of your trustees, administration, faculty, staff and student body with regard to the antics of S.T.O.P. As a concerned parent, I was horrified to receive issues of The Bucknellian showing this organization defacing the grounds of Bucknell University without restraint, namely, the mock graves by the University Center and the chalking of sidewalks. As the president of a private institution, you have every right and the obligation to interpret and dictate those policies which best serve the University. My daughter, Janelle, '93, tells me that it is the University's view that ""freedom of speech"" is at the heart of S.T.O.P.'s ability to embark on these shameful displays. Has your desire to maintain an open campus where academic freedom and the exploration of knowledge is enkindled by any kind of expression clouded your vision? Dr. Sojka, it is somewhere around the age of seven that the philosophy of ""rights and duties"" is introduced to the human mind. If one fails to grasp the concept at that time, there is yet another chance some years later in Logic 101. Simply put, and there is no need to be otherwise, that concept states: an individual has every right to freely express himself in any manner he chooses so long as that expression does not infringe on the rights of others. With all due respect. Dr. Sojka, I would suggest that my daughter's rights and that of many others on campus are being infringed upon by S.T.O.P.'s antics. It is deeply upsetting to her to have to view these displays on a daily basis. It is offensive to her to be ""told"" that the only thing at stake in the Middle East is the number of Americans who will die if there is war. It is not right for her and others to be subjected to this kind of obscene behavior. She and others have the ""right"" to be protected from sanctimonious, See S.T.O.P., p. 10"
Faith helps overcome war worries,"To the Editor: The United States is currently involved in a war in the Gulf. However, I am more concerned by the inner turmoil that is occurring here at home. Everything has gone crazy. The world has exploded in war and people's brains have gone right with it. Personally, I have no problem with feeling out of control of the situation. Who am I to even begin to think that I have such power? God is in full control of my life. And God is in full control of the situation in the Middle East. I trust Him completely. ""There is a time for every purpose under heaven"" (Ecclesiastes 3:1). There is ""a time for peace and a time for war"" (Ecclesiastes 3:8). If now is the time for war, who am I to question God's judgment? It's not that I don't care, I do. I am afraid that the worst will happen. I am afraid that there will be a draft and I will see boys and men I love go off to Saudi Arabia and fight and die. I am afraid to'see the yellow ribbons replaced by black. So there it is: the worst case scenario. And if it happens, God will help me through it. What annoys me is that everyone is spending so much time thinking about the worst case scenarios (many fully justified) that they are not enjoying the time they are given now. Okay, perhaps you will have to fight or see those you love fight and possibly die (I offer no judgment on which is worse). But what good will it do to spend every minute until then worrying about it? If this is to be the last six months you spend with those you love, are you going to worry or are you going to savor every possible moment of time that remains? I would hate to see those I love die on the battlefield. But I would hate even more to see them die before they got there. We are a generation that grew up knowing nothing of war. Our lack of experiential knowledge only heightens our fears. But war is nothing to be afraid of if only we trust in the almighty power of God. Who else is best capable of destroying a madman like Hussein? I am surprised to find that I am more afraid of the chaos around me than I am of the chaos of the actual war. I am amazed at all the things-gone-wrong that people are See FAITH, p. 10"

Should the U.S. be involved in the Gulf war?,"By Stephen J. Leshinski After all the flag-waving and ribbon-wearing and hom-honking; after all the articles are written and speeches are made and songs are sung; after all the rubble's cleared and all the bodies buried, the questions will remain and if we're not prepared to answer these questions, honestly and thoughtfully, then we have to stop right now. Why is everyone so convinced that war is the only way to get done what we think needs be done? Our children will ask, weren't there other ways of doing it? Wasn't there an opportunity for diplomacy or economic sanctions? And although we will say we tried, can we say we tried hard enough? What do we risk to lose by using diplomacy and economic sanctions: the annexation of Kuwait? the domination of foreign oil by Saddam Hussein? Yet what do we risk to lose by going to war? Everything. Even now we watch the oil flood the gulf and the bombs destroy the houses and the bullets kill the people and we are hurt and scared. But the most frightening part of war is not what is known but what is unknown. Dwight Eisenhower said, ""Every war will astound you."" World War II led to the atomic bomb; Vietnam led to Agent Orange and still today countries all over the world are recovering from these tragedies. What will this one bring? Hundreds, thousands, millions of deaths? Chemical weapons? Environmental catastrophe?....Nuclear war? We will have to tell our children we thought of all this when we decided that war was right. That even though we couldn't begin to imagine the cost in human life or the environmental damage it might bring, we thought it was that important to us to fight. Even though our objectives were unclear and that Americans would make up to 90% of the casualties in this ""world-wide coalition"" and that anti-American demonstrations would tear apart already strained Arab-American relations, that all of us looked into ourselves and saw, with the clarity and resolve that a war demands, that our answer would have to be: yes, war. I think this war can and should be opposed on all levels. Right from the start our objectives have been unclear, and yet we decided that this was an issue of paramount importance. Right from the start the nation was divided and the Congress split right up the middle, but George Bush continued to insist that the nation was completely behind the use of force. Right from the start the efficacy of war was doubted. Right from the start no one knew for sure what they were getting into or why. Right from the start millions suffered from AIDS, homelessness, malnutrition, and illiteracy but still our government spends close to a billion dollars a day thousandsof miles away. If it doesn't make sense now, how can it make sense in ten years? By Richard Chew III This nation may take comfort in our reaction to the Persian Gulf War. Support for our troops has been near universal regardless of personal beliefs concerning the conduct of Operation Desert Storm by the government However, it must remain clear and indisputable, that support for our troops is not tantamount to support for the policies of the Bush administration in implementing United Nations resolutions to remove Saddam Hussein's dictatorial oppression of the Kuwaiti people. In the few weeks since the war has been joined by the forces of the coalition against Iraq, a number of significant phenomena have been realized that should convince all but the most stalwart isolationist or foolhardy pacifist that war represents the only option, the only reasonable choice. The strength of the allied bombing of Iraq represents an unprecedented display of air power in military history. Never before has a nation withstood so much destructive force in such a short period of time. Despite legendary air strikes against London, Dresden, Japan and Vietnam, air power on this level has heretofore remained unrealized. Allied forces have now flown close to sixty-thousand sorties, unleashing nearly half a million tons of explosives against Iraqi targets, raining an unstoppable fury of death upon the awaiting hell below. And Hussein has muscled down into Kuwait even further. It is a testimony to that dictator's extreme disregard for human life that he has not conceded when faced with annihilation, and should stand as proof that the continuation of economic sanctions alone would have been a fruitless and insufficient gesture. Allied forces have crippled the Iraqi economy, yet Hussein beckons to the West that the slaughter continue. Economic sanctions would have only succeeded in changing the angle of the gun that Hussein is holding at the head of the Kuwaiti people when it was desperately clear that the gun had to be removed from his possession. The forty-seven Democrats who voted in favor of sanctions, and anyone who sympathized with such an approach, must now realize that military action represented the only viable solution. Others complain that the bombing has been carried too far, that the United States has exceeded the United Nations mandates in seeking the destruction of Iraq rather than the liberation of Kuwait. Just as the American people have learned to support their troops despite the nature of the conflict, American leaders have learned that war must be massive and decisive. To have launched a direct frontal assault upon Iraqi positions in Kuwait would have been suicidal, and instead of having fewer than a hundred U.S. casualties and nearly a fifth of Iraq's fighting capability obliterated, there would have been tens of thousands of wasted lives with the unfortunate remainder faced with an enemy largely unscarrcd by the face of war. We have fought this war on our own terms, not Hussein's, and the systematic destruction of Iraqi war-making ability serves that purpose."
President Bush's naked lie,"By Rob Schroeder A few weeks ago, George Bush told the world a lie. Before millions of people, he claimed that the United States of America has ""worked long and hard to achieve a peaceful solution"" in the conflict between Iraq and Kuwait Now immortalized, his words are ringing in my ears like a bomb blast searing through a soldier's brain. I am stunned. Bush said he gave peace a chance. But the sound reverberating in my ears isn't a sonorous one, nor one that makes me proud of my President for trying his best The sound is sinister. I can't believe him, try as I may. And now, as the world and I watch the death tolls rise, I am desperately asking myself one simple question: ""Why is the U.S. in the Persian Gulf?"" Thanks to the mass media, all of us have heard the official arguments for the United States' military build up in the region. It's entirely about ""naked aggression,"" the White House would have us think; it's about freedom, emancipation, and righting the wrong of Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait. Mr. Hussein and Mr. Bush themselves have put it in even sim pler terms: their two countries are locked in Armageddon. It is a classic conflict of good versus evil; and each man thinks he embodies the good. The two men have made a moral spectacle out of the conflict in the Middle East, and have raced into solving it the hard and fast way: through force. War is now upon us. The United States is in the Persian Gulf for two reasons: to win that war, and to stand up for what it thinks is correct. The truth of democracy, say U.S. politicians, shall make Kuwait free. Day in and day out, we the people arc fed this passionate rhetoric...and it's pretty believable. Small wonder. Inspired and awestruck by Bush's televised daily lessons, the American people have been sapped of thcircritical thinking. We have almost no choice but to agree and cheer on. The media applauds Bush...and makes us forget that there's a flipside to reading his lips. We forget that the United States has ignored so-called ""naked aggression"" in the past, and forget that this country's war machine is running its fastest since the Vietnam era. We are forced to overlook the cries of ""No blood for oil!,"" and are cruelly made to watch the ""justified"" deaths of our country's soldiers. Indoctrinated by the government, we have lost sight of the harsh realities of the hell on earth that people call war. Some call it a just war. I call it a deadly mistake by the headstrong President of a hypocritical country. Why? Because there are things that Bush hasn't been telling you. Our president hasn't told us about Indonesia, Turkey, Morocco, or Israel. These countries respectively took over East Timor, northern Cyprus, the Spanish Sahara, and Southern Lebanon through the current rallying point of American foreign policy: naked aggression. Each invasion was unprovoked by military action, and every bit as brutal as the Iraqi's of Kuwait Yet each went virtually unnoticed by the United States, and went unpunished. Where were the passionate speeches then? Where was the concern for human rights? The United States' willingness to forgive our allies ought to make you wonder how concerned our policy makers really are with ""naked aggression."" This forgiveness should also make you wonder if there is something else that is keeping your friends and neighbors in the Persian Gulf. And it should ultimately convince you that US foreign policy revolves around much more than aggression. Oil is a big reason the U.S. is in the Gulf, whether you want to believe it or not. ""If Kuwait's main export was carrots,"" queried a New York Times editorial some weeks ago, ""do you think that the United States would be there?"" That's a good question. It's interesting to note that six of the twelve largest U.S. corporations are oil monopolies, depending on the region for its reserves of the precious fuel. And it is even more interesting to note whose way of life we are defending: profit-m aking corporations and oil-hungry countries without alternative energy policies. Bush might claim to be defending Kuwait's way of life, but when was the last time you heard that the U.S. supported monarchies so strongly that it was willing to kill for one? Kuwait and Saudi Arabia are no democracies. What they are is insurance. Insurance that oil is cheap and profits are high. Would we be there if there wasn't a threat to our high standard of living? Even as I hear the sounds of aircraft fire and bombs bursting over Baghdad, I can only answer to myself, dejectedly, ""no."" The patriot in me wants to believe that George Bush has not gone to war--in any way-- for oil. The realist in me, though, knows he has. George Bush and his administration have fooled us. They have tricked us, the citizenry of the world, into believing that the United States' commitment in the Persian Gulf is solely to democracy, and a free way of life for the Kuwaitis. ""The rights of liberty and independence should be granted with godspeed to all people on earth,"" I can imagine Mr. Bush saying with a tear in his eye. And for a moment, I can imagine myself thinking he's truly sincere. My heart would thump with a patriotic fervor as my President told me everything was ok; but not for long. Too much hypocrisy exists for me to believe Bush. Too many contradictions exist. It would not take me long to think of South Africa, for instance, where blacks still miserably struggle for democracy, and have been subjected to innumerable acts of violent aggression. It doesn't take a genius to figure out that the United States has economic interests in that country, and perhaps make the connection that heavy sanctions would be a suicidal move. The conflict in Israel would also come quickly to mind, along with the United States' reluctance to stand up for the rights of Palestinians in that country. We must remember, after all, that the U.S. has a free trade agreement with Israel. Investments, economics, free trade...it all adds up toone big contradiction: where there's money to be made, the United States will (or will not) stop ""naked aggression."" Clearly the U.S. is concerned with more than America's newest household term. There's money at stake. Every day, more American and allied planes are reported missing, and more soldiers are pronounced dead. Meanwhile, the $30 billion spent on Desert Shield increases, as the Desert Storm rages across the land of the Middle East. While the United States fights its overseas war for the American way, taxes are raised and services are cut at home. For soldiers, their families, and people like you and me, suffering is on the rise...and for what? This war is not just about ""naked aggression."" Bush is just plain lying if he says that oil and economics arc not major reasons the U.S. is in the Persian Gulf. His reassuring voice, the voice that told the world he gave peace a chance, has now receded from the depths of my brain. In its place are the cries of dying soldiers, and the fatal clock ticking down to the bitter end when the smoke clears and the tolls are added up. I've been lied to, and I feel pretty bad. Don't you?"

student life post,"To the Bucknell Community: It is with mixed feelings that I announce that I will be leaving Bucknell at the end of the spring semester. For personal and career reasons my husband and I have decided to move to the South to be nearer to our family roots and his professional network. This has been a difficult decision as this is a challenging and exciting time to be involved in reshaping student life at Bucknell and I have had much personal and professional satisfaction in being a part of it, but Jim and I feel that this move is the right one for us at this time and for our future. Bucknell has been a wonderful experience for me, and I have really enjoyed being a member of this very special educational partnership. I feel that 1 have accomplished my major administrative goals and tasks assigned to me by the President on arriving at Bucknell five years ago with assistance from many of you. I leave with confidence that the Division of Student Life's excellent staff will continue the fine programs and high quality services which are now in place for students. During the coming semester I look forward to working with the TIP groups to bring the planning efforts to fruition, to implement the Trustee decisions and to conclude any other projects in which I have a central role. Please call on me if there are ways in which I can assist you in any way before my departure in July. I look forward with enthusiasm to identifying specifically the right combination of needs and opportunities to engage my energies in the years to come, having already had two different and rewarding major careers in my life. I particularly want to complete some long- deferred research and writing before committing myself to anything on a full-time basis, but I am open to interesting career possibilities that the South may present My thanks to each of you for your invaluable cooperation and support in our work together. It has been a genuine pleasure to work with you and I am proud of what we have accomplished together. Best wishes for the future.

Faith,"From page 8 now blaming on the war. It's the old ""There's a war and life stinks."" I am more distraught by the attitudes of some of the people around me than I am by the concept of war. I do not think this war can or should be usedas an excuse for everything that has gone wrong in your life. It should not be ""Well, I lost my hamster, then my grandmother, I flunked a Bio exam, and now there's this stupid war!"" Obviously, different people will have different reactions to the war based on their own personal experience (or lack thereof)- Some people feel especially threatened because the war is one thing they have absolutely no control over. And it drives them crazy. And they in turn, drive me crazy. I got a shocked stare today when someone asked me what I thought of the war and I responded ""Oh well, we can just pray."" It's not that I don't care, but honestly, what good will it do to watch CNN twenty-four hours a day and just worry and worry and worry? I refuse. Besides, there are more than enough people worrying for me. But I will not let them disturb the inner calm, the inner peace I have found. There is a war and no one can be sure what will happen. The only thing we can do is wait and pray and trust that God will show the way. The world is wracked by the storm of war. But in the end, there will be sun, and in the rainbow will appear the earth. There will be a time for peace. ""Do not fear, only believe"" (Mark 5:36). Sincerely, Susan J. LaMaire '93 February 11,1991"

Faculty m em ber,
supports breaking,
ties with R.O.T.C.,"To The Bucknellian: On February 11, the faculty decided to delay voting on the motion to sever ties between the university and ROTC. The purpose of the delay is to allow a fuller discussion of this complex issue. The issue is complex because it engages both principles and persons, both abstractions and concrete human beings. Each member of the Bucknell community will have to find some way to make peace with these various parts of the question The principle at stake is our university policy against discrimination because of gender and sexual orientation. To the extent that the motion i$ a symbolic comment on the war, another principle at stake is our university policy of furthering human thought and discourse as the alternative to domination and violence. ROTC and its Army patron violate both of these principles. The people at stake are military personnel--our students currently in ROTC and those who might come to Bucknell because Bucknell can help them to take advantage of ROTC scholarships. And, to the extent that the motion is a symbolic comment on the war, the people at stake are American men and women fighting in the Gulf. What needs discussion is how each of us can juggle contradictory conclusions. For my part, for example, I oppose the ROTC in terms of principle, and yet I want not to assault or insult individuals for whom ROTC may be their only way to go to college. And I certainly oppose the war, as well as the politicians who made the policies that got us into it, and yet I want not to turn on those in the Gulf, caught up in the fray for patriotic reasons or because they believed the army would help them be all they could be. It is all very well for the faculty to pronounce its position on matters of principle, but this has to be accompanied by other kinds of faculty participation in Bucknell culture--to educate, persuade, listen, learn, teach our students, our friends on the support staff, alumni, and even parents. In the case of the Greek vote last year, the faculty voted on principle, then retreated to their offices, expecting to be taken seriously. But the Bucknell culture we are trying to change is complicated, and it requires more than pronouncement by way of faculty vote. It requires discussion, the give and take of opinion, feeling and fact. Let us use the time until the vote comes up, presumably in March, to do better by our constituents than we did before. Let us keep the conversation going. I shall support the motion to sever Bucknell's ties with ROTC, because I believe that is in fact the best way to support the people-- although I recognize this requires an argument That the argument happens, that we recognize and respect our differing opinions, that we agree to be bound by the outcomes in the spirit of patience and tolerance--these arc fruits of the discussion we can live on long after the vote.

Bush --,"From page 8 Each day that passes means another day for Iraq's forces to dig deeper into their stolen land. Another day Saddam Hussein can work toward building his nuclear arsenal and perfecting his chemical and biological weapons capability. Another day of atrocities for Amnesty International to document Another day of international outlaws, instead of international law. I ask you to think about the economic devastation that Saddam Hussein would continue to wreak on the world's emerging democracies if he were in control of one-fifth of the world's oil reserves."
S.T.O.P.,"From page 8 rhetorical images even while she and others perform their ""duty"" by examining the issues with clarity, emotional restraint, and level gaze. The members of S.T.O.P. have the ""right"" to express themselves, but they have a corresponding ""duty"" to do so with respect for the rights of others. If it were our son who was one of the armed forces who have died accidentally in the Persian Gulf, we would be offended and ashamed that his memory and honor in serving his country has been desecrated by these visual images. I do not mean to say that the issues of a potential war should not be discussed carefully and rationally, but it does mean that the hysterical, circus-like display that characterizes S.T.O.P.'s protests must be rejected and stopped. I will not debate S.T.O.P.'s purpose here, except to say that they arc not the first activist organization to wrap themselves in lofty principle to achieve a self- serving goal, and you, above all And to reflect on the terrible threat that a Saddam Hussein armed with weapons of mass destruction already poses to human life and to the future of all nations. Together, as an America united against these horrors, we can, with our coalition partners, assure that this aggression is stopped and the principles on which this nation and the rest of the civilized world are founded are preserved. And so let us remember and support Terry Hatfield, all our fine servicemen and women, as they stand ready on the frontier of freedom, willing to do their duty and do it well. They deserve our complete and enthusiastic support-- and lasting gratitude. else, should be able to discern that fact and not be intimidated by them. Jancllc and I and her father spent considerable time and effort finding the ""right"" university for her. Not the least in our parameters was a campus with a history of conservative values, and so it is disheartening to us after much time and money to see S.T.O.P.'s sacrilegious behavior in the name of peace go unchallenged by the University. It makes a mockery of our Constitution's freedom of speech protection. Therefore, I call upon you to take the steps to protect my daughter's rights and those of others, and immediately dismantle the display in front of the U.C. and prevent further such violations of the rights of my daughter and others. Thank you. Sincerely yours, Diane E. Oltorik December 6,1990 Editor's Note: The Bucknellian war sent a copy of this open letter to President Sojka."
Readers react to student,
criticism of BSG election results,"Dear Sir: Regarding the commentary by David Murray on the outcome of the B.S.G. election (Bucknellian , Dec. 7,1990), we have read The Bucknellian both on and off campus for many years and have never seen such a shameful display of ""sour grapes."" In any election there is a winner and a loser. The winner is decided by the voters (and if voter apathy is a problem on campus then this issue should be addressed separately). Who is ""better"" must be judged by time and performance in the elected position. Mr. Murray appears to be using his position as managing editor of The Bucknellian to engage in unnecessary name calling instead of in constructive criticism of actual policies or events. It is unfortunate for Mr. Murray that his preferred candidate did not win, but a display of good sportsmanship would be much more welcome than the childish tantrum that his remarks seem to reflect. Good luck to Ms. Mayo and her fellow B.S.G. officers. We hope that Mr. Murray's comments do not reflect the kind of support that they will receive from the student body whom they have been elected to represent. Sincerely, Merle Keifer Class of 1962 December 13,1990 To the Editor: I am writing in response to an editorial that appeared in the Dec. 7th issue of The Bucknellian concerning the election of Vanessa Mayo to the position of BSG treasurer. In this editorial, David Murray advanced several good points and a few unfair ones. Was attendance at pre-election speeches and forums pathetic? Yes. Was voter tum-out itself poor? Definitely. Is it an atrocity that Ms. Mayo was elected? I don't think so. Dave Fries was an excellent candidate to be sure. He was my special assistant and I am confident that he would have done an exemplary job. This does not mean that Ms. Mayo will not perform well in her new position. No one runs for a position, subjects themselves to scrutiny, accepts countless unpaid hours and takes on tremendous responsibility if they do not feel they have the dedication, the skill and the foresight to get the job done. Ms. Mayo's success in getting involved should be applauded, not criticized. I mean no disrespect to Mr. Murray; he spoke out on some important problems. Like Ms. Mayo, Mr. Fries and myself, Mr. Murray offered his views in the hopes that it would improve Bucknell; that's something we should all try to do. I wish Ms. Mayo and the rest of the Bucknell Student Government officers the best of luck in the coming year. David Skena '92 Former BSG President February 12,1991"
Student clarifies BSG,
election opinion,"To the Editor: Sometimes, even with good intentions and a valid point, one's message is lost when written down. Such is certainly the case with my December 7,1990 opinion about the results of the Bucknell Student Government elections. In my opinions piece, I unfairly and inappropriately singled out Vanessa Mayo '93. While I personally believe Dave Fries '93 was a better choice in the election for BSG treasurer, that was not intended to be my point. In fact, I am certain that Ms. Mayo will adequately perform her duties and am delighted that she cares enough about Bucknell to volunteer. The message I attempted to convey was simply this: there was inexcusable voter apathy. We did not educate ourselves sufficiently about the candidates before we voted for them, and many of us did not bother to vote at all. Unfortunately, I used but one example to substantiate my point, and while Ms. Mayo is a public figure open to public criticism, my characterization of her as 'incompetent' was not based on available, substantiated facts. Now, with the elections long- since passed, I can only repeat my wish of 'good luck' to the BSG. We'll be watching. David Murray '92 Managing Editor, The Bucknellian February 13,1991 tl"

Bucknellians go Navajo in January,
For,
20 years,
",",
students have experienced Indian culture in Jan Plan,"By Sue Basalla Senior Staff Writer A sleeper of a Jan Plan for the last twenty years, the Navajo teaching program offers students the chance to be a teacher's aide in a Navajo boarding school. This January, 31 Bucknellians travelled to four different boarding schools in Arizona and New Mexico: Tuba City, Shonto, Chuska-Tohatchi and Chinle. For three weeks, they lived in dorms, assisted teachers in the classroom, and participated in Boy Scout hikes, basketball games and school dances. While try ing out their teaching skills and rediscovering elementary school cafeteria cuisine, the Bucknellians also learned about the Navajo culture. Informal conversations with teachers, administrators and Navajo children provided the Bucknellians with an introduction to the world of the Navajo: its language, mythology and social customs, (see sidebar ""A Navajo Journal"") Although many students are unaware that it even exists, the Navajo Jan Plan has been a part of the curriculum since 1971. The program was developed in 1970, when Dr. J. Charles Jones, emeritus"
A N avajo Journal,"Editor's Note: Following are extracts from the journal Sue Basalla kept while living at Shonto this January. Jan. 8 - First day, had no clue what to expect. I was assigned to a 7th and 8th grade language arts class. Helped students with their autobiographical essays, good way to get to know them. Their language skills were surprisingly bad, then"
I,"remembered that for many of them English is their second language. The kids were fun to work with though- quick to laugh at any thing. Most of them just stare at us, talk about us in Navajo and giggle. Lots of giggling. Jan. 9- Responded to their journal entries today and learned more about their lives at home. Some empty Christmases, lots of travelling to sec relatives in Colorado or California. My favorite entry: ""It was a boring vacation. I chopped wood for my grandmother and played Nintendo. On New Year's Eve my mom had a baby."" An 8th grade girl asked me how it feels to be white. Tough question- I've never stuck out in crowd before the way I do here. She wrote that ""white women arc okay, but white men give me the chills."" Jan. 11 - The 7th & 8th grade reading teacher (great guy!) helped us through the somewhat long Shonto weekend. Some kids arc here but they don ' t do any th i ng but watch TV. We helped out with the basketball tournament and hiked into the canyon next to the school, beautiful place. Jan. 14-Must take a special breed of teacher to come out here. The teachers all complain about the red tape of BIA (Bureau of Indian Affairs)-1 would've thought the isolation would be their biggest gripe. But actually, Shonto is growing on me, too. It's so empty and quiet, only mesas and grubby little trees in every direction- no traffic, no Mini-Marts, no Burger Kings, no noise. Jan. 23 - Saw first real evidence of the poverty on the rez today. Helped a girl write a letter thanking her ""Save the Children"" sponsor for the $2.00 he sent. Strange, the kids wear British Knights but that's pretty much all they own. One teacher told me that when charities donate Christmas presents the kids all ask for Nike Pumps- that's how they can afford $90 sneakers. Jan. 25 - Our last night here- watched our93rd basketball game. At half-time they called all of us onto the court to say goodbye. The stud of the boy's basketball team put bright yellow ""Shonto Bears"" hats on our heads- little kids gave us necklaces of cedar beads which bring good luck and chase away bad dreams. Kids I've never seen before asked for my address- hey, mail is mail. Jan. 26 - The bus driver who took us back to Flagstaff today told us about the industries that have come to the rez. Even though the uranium mining etc. is destroying their land, the Navajos want even more companies to locate out here. They're so desperate for jobs that their poverty overrides their traditional respect for the environment. One more con diet between the traditional and the modem life... Courtesy of Wendy Shaver Bucknellians sport their parting gifts from the Shonto students: baseball hats and cedar beads. From left to right: Chris O'Lare '93, Brian Bastress '93, Wendy Shaver '92 and Sue Basalla '92. professor of education, travelled to Arizona to visit his son, a teacher at Tuba City Boarding School. Hearing Dr. Jones speak about his trip, a chemical engineering student, Peter Anderson ('77), wanted to see the reservation as well. The principal of Tuba City Boarding School agreed to house Anderson if he would help in the classroom in return. Anderson made ""quite a favorable impression,"" according to Dr. Jones. The next January, Tuba City Boarding School accepted fifteen Bucknell students who had heard about the experience from Anderson. Over the next few years, Shonto, Chinle and Chuska-Tohatchi were also persuaded to accept Bucknell students. These four schools have hosted Bucknell students for the past twenty years. During the early 70's, a fifth school, Toya Boarding School, experiemented with the Bucknell program. Toya refused to accept Bucknell students after the first year, however, citing problems with students bringing alcohol to the reservation. (The Navajo Tribal Council prohibits selling or consum ing alcohol on the reservation because of the Navajos' genetic predisposition for alcoholism.) In more recent years, the Bucknell-Navajo connection has been strained by the increasing bureaucracy of the federal government. In 1990, the Bureau of Indian Affairs mandated that all visitors staying in reservation schools for longer than three days must submit to a background check. The law requiring this 10-page form was prompted by concern about child abuse in the schools. Asked if any year of the program seemed particularly memorable. Dr. Jones, speaking from his home in North Carolina, recalled the year that two black students went to the reservation. Traditionally, the Navajo arc prejudiced against black people, but Harvey Edwards ('78) and Cynthia Jones ('79) agreed to try the program. According to Dr. Jones, the students were quickly accepted by the Navajo children. In fact, CynthiaJoncstaughtmodem African dance to the kids and, as Dr. Jones said, ""Confounded anthropologists for years to come."" Although Bucknell University and the Navajo schools have succeeded in bridging their cultural differences, the Navajo Jan Plan may not last another twenty years. According to Mr. Kee Dayzie, educational consultant at Shonto Boarding School, the schools arc teaching less and less of the traditional Navajo legends, language and customs. In three generations, he predicted, the culture will have virtually disappeared. And why would Bucknell students travel across the country to see just another typical American middle school?"
Bison Tales in quest of condoms,"By Marc Haimes Staff Writer The first time I bough t condoms Itookthcdircctapproach. I strode up to good-natured Dr. Bob at the prescription counter, looked him right in the eye and asked him politely for some ""Prophylactic Devices."" Unfortunately, Dr Bob, who was no longer a young man, thought I asked for ""Prophylaxis Devices."" I ended up leaving Drug-Mart with a Water Pick, Dental Floss, and three tubes of Tartar Control Crest. Well, Dr. Bob retired two years later, and during those 24 months, my dresser drawer might not have boasted a large suppl y of rubbers, but I did have strong gums and a hcalthy-looking smile. Now that I'm a self-secure college student I take the mature approach. I wait until 1:00 in the morning and buy them at a deserted 7-11. If the guy at the counter speaks English, I tell him they're for my dad. Let's face it, when it comes to purchasing embarrassing supplies, condoms rank right up there with Kayopcctatc and Mylanta. I think the general rule is that we are not even allowed to talk about condoms, let alone buy them. Interestingly enough, it is still perfectly acceptable to speak about the actual act of intercourse, as long it is with a large group of the same gender and you use colorful euphemisms. If the preceding logic confuses you, just glance at the following dialogue which can serve as an ""appropriate conversation"" guide. Note that Guys #1 and #2 exhibit proper sex-talk technique complete with original and witty imagery while Guy#3 has not quite caught on... Guy #1: Dudes, I had such a great time Friday. I picked up this percussionist-babe with bodacious bongos and we went back to my place"
AND DID THE BEDSPRING,"BOSS A-NOV A 17 times in one night. Everyone: Yeahh, alright, nice going etc. Guy #2: Well, I grabbed myself this slam-hound from Australia with really firm. . . Kangaroos, and she took me to her room and TOSSED MY BOOMERANG!!!! Everyone: Way to go, what a stud, cool etc. Guy #3: Well, I did meet a potential mating partner with a sizable bust, but I didn't have proper protection so wedidn'tgo all the way. Everyone: Booo, what a jerk, Loooooscr. Guy#3: Instead we chugged Kayopectate and played with my Tartar Control Crest. As you can plainly sec any mention or implication of the C word is strictly forbidden and definitely improper. That is why I'm so thankful that our ever-considcrate administration appointed a special task force to deal with potential condom-buying embarrassment when it was discovered that there were, in fact, two boxes of them being sold at the Bison Convenience Store right here at Bucknell! The ""Official Condom Committee"" in a brilliant top secret maneuver known as ""Operation Flaccid"" solved what could have been an embarrassing situation for all students by simply removing the condoms from the shelf and informing the manager that they should not be ordered again. Luckily though, the committee decided to do nothing about the 14 different brands of cigarettes stocked right next to the forbidden rubber sheathes. Which makes sense because even though cigarettes have been proven to cause violent gagging deaths where green slime painfully grows on your lungs and eats away at your vocal chords causing you to speak like a wooden hinge, it is still socially acceptable and not even slightly embarrassing for the convenience store to carry them. On the other hand, those nasty little condoms have been banished down to laundry rooms all over campus. However, even under ideal condi tions thi s d ispenser location can sometimes make life difficult .... Male Potential Sex Partner: Well, we have been engaging in stimulating foreplay for the past 45 minutes. I seem to be fully erect and I think it is now time for penetration to begin. Female Potential Sex Partner: Aren't we lucky that we havecondomsavailablcjust5 flights down? Male Potential Sex Partner. Yes, we certainly are. And even though our clothes are flung all around the room and we have worked ourselves up to a complete sexual frenzy. . . I just happen to have 50 cents in exact change right here to make my purchase. See you in a few minutes. Don't go anywhere. Female Potential Sex Partner: Honey, do you think you could buy... two of them? Male Potential Sex Partner: Oh no. Sorry dear, I don't have enough nickels. So the question remains: How can we obtain convenient access to a variety of condoms without having to face the humiliation of buying them at the Convenience Store? And the answer is... Next Week: The solution to the prophylactic predicament."

HBO features Lewisburg,"By Peter Lalos Staff Writer Home Box Office's ""America Undercover"" scries aired an hour- long special Tuesday night on the Lewisburg Federal Penitentiary. The producers of the documentary ""Doing Time: Life Inside the Big House"" received from the Justice Department unprecedented access to film inside the maximum security institution. From its opening scenes, the film seemed intent on depicting the harsh realities of prison life for both the men who work and arc imprisoned within the penitentiary's walls. This theme was captured best during a discussion with the prison's supervising officer in charge on the topic of home-made weapons. The officer explained to an incredulous interviewer that home-made knives (nicknamed ""shanks""), not fists, were the mostcommon modcof protection for most inmates. The officer even went so far as to display a reluctant admiration for the prisoners' ability to fashion such an array of lethal weapons. More telling about life inside the ""Big House,"" as the Lewisburg prison has come to be known, though, was the documentary's analysis of prisoner mentality-- if nothing else, the film exemplified the fact that no two arc necessarily the same. One inmate, who was incarcerated for his involvement in a France-based heroin smuggling operation and sentenced to life without parole, insisted to the interviewer that he was framed. He went on to use the film's interview as a forum for denouncing the justice system, in particular the courtroom pica bargaining of another convicted criminal which led to his current jail term. Another inmate, a dishwasher in the penitentiary, demonstrated the tendency of many prisoners to gradually accept the countless hardships and loss of basic liberties. He calmly described the widespread homosexuality amongst the inmate ranks. Despite the distribution of condoms in the facility, AIDS-rclatcd deaths in the prisoner population are an almost common occurence,an expected fact of life. A third inmate, a self-described ""nice guy,"" pointed to self-defense as the reason for his killing four fellow inmated. Another man, who was imprisoned for making multiple threats on President Reagan's life, claimed that he wanted to be jailed in order to conduct an ""undercover"" investigation of the nation's prison system. Despite such a questionable motivation, prison officials determined him to be sane after placing him under psychiatric observation. Undoubtedly, each man questioned during the film had his own way of dealing with his confinement. One of the last inmates to be questioned had received three life sentences for the triple homicide of his nephew, sister, and her husband. He asserted, however, that he had felt no remorse for his crimes and had completely forgiven himself since he had discovered religion. Ironically enough, the man said that it was a section from the New Testament that he read which fueled his desires to commit the murders-- he went so far, in fact, as to say that he envisioned his nephew as a ""new devil."" There is little wonder, then, as to why many prison officials are skeptical about the sudden discovery of God and the subsequent""reform""of such inmates. Despite the emphasis given to prisoner life in the penitentiary, which currently houses about 1,500 men, a considerable amount of the documentary's footage also focused b"

penitentiary,"on the institution's officals. A segment run at the midway point of the film keyed in on the role of the prison's warden, who was shown making his daily tour of Lcwisburg's cell blocks. He patiently stopped to listen to the concerns of the disgruntled inmates, all the while imploring them to go through the propcrchannclsof dialogue and ""put it in writing."" It grew increasingly evident that the warden had long ago mastered the ability to make concessions to his charges without giving too much ground. Similarly, the documentary displayed how the institution's hearings officer has grown accustomed to repeatedly handing down rulings on offenses committed inside the prison, often based on nothing more than the testimonies of cell guards and/or other inmates. In both cases, the officials were depicted as men who were being forced to smooth out potentially volatile situations on a daily basis. The final aspect of the film's emphasis on the routine of the institution's staff focused on the role of the penitentiary's Special Operations Response Team (SORT), an elite group of guards required at all high-security level federal prisons. SORT is utilized in the same manner as police SWAT teams, for riot or hostage situations. The special showed the team in two separate file tape videos released by the U.S. Justice Department, in which they removed violent inmates from their cells and transported them to other holding blocks. In an institution where the inmates outnumber the staff by a ratioof six to one, the SORTguards' aim is to insure the orderly handling of such prisoners along with the minimalizing of physical harm to both staff and inmates in the process. Fittingly, however, the documentary concluded with segments of yet more prisoner case studies, and one in particular seemed to sum up the inmates' overall plight. It dealt with a convict who fashioned himself as a top-notch rapper and was not hesitant redisplay his talents to the film crew. The message in his rap was thought-provoking enough, but the perfection in his rhythm and his fluid enunciation were more telling. He gave the type of lcttcr- pcrfccl delivery which, one would believe, could only be attained after endless, repetitive practice. Perhaps this perfection was attainable because, as the ""Doing Time"" documentary demonstrated, time is the inmates' only true companion. Editor's Note: The documentary ""Doing Time: Life Inside the Big House"" will be aired again on Channel20 this month on: February 17th at 10:30pm February 21st at 10:30pm February 25th at 3:30 am February 27th at 12:10 am i / page 12 The Buckneltian February 15, 1991"

The Bucknellian,"Page 13 By Mitch Benton Staff Writer Both of Bucknell's swimming and diving squads had outstanding showings at last weekend's inaugural Patriot League Championships. The women's team set five school records and finished the competition trailing only champion Army, 565.5-551.5. The men's team came off their disappointing season, in which they finished l-10on the year to trail only Fordham and Lehigh. Leading the women's team, w ich finished the season 6-4, was M irgaret Grunow '93, who was ru iner-up by one point to Army's C< Ueen Criscillo in the competition fo Outstanding Female Swimmer. Grunow won two individual events over the weekend, the 100 (53.08) and 200 (1:53.37) yard freestyles, and teamed with co-captain Kelly Appier '91, Kathleen Hartnett '94, and Andrea Falcione '92 to establish school records in the200-yard medley relay (1:50.02). Harnett, Grunow, and Falcione combined with co-captain Carla Banashek '91 to win the 400- yard medley relay in a school record time of 4:01.23. Falcione placed second in the 50-yard freestyle in 24.08, making her the second-best performer in Bucknell history. Harnett trailed Falcione in the event, placing third, and followed that performance with a new school record in the 50-yard backstroke (28.20), while swimming the lead leg in the 200-yard medley relay. The men's squad tallied 591 points over the weekend, 80 points behind Fordham and 26 behind Lehigh. They, too, were led by the outstanding perform ance of a sophomore, Jay Gross, who also finished second in the battle for Outstanding Swimmer. In addition, Don Steenson '92 tied for fourth for this award, while Rick Hutchinson '91 finished eighth. Gross recorded one of the Bison's numerous pool records in the 50 yard freestyle, with 21.06, the third best score in Bucknell history. Gross also won the 100-yard butterfly (50.84) and teamed with Steenson, Kevin Schroth '92 and Dietrich Conze '94 to place second in the 200- yard freestyle relay. The same team with Chad Farrell '92 replacing Conze came in second in the 400- yard medley relay, before winning the200-yard medley relay. Their time of 1:34.97 was the school's second- best ever. Steenson earned his ranking by taking two individual events, both in times ranking second in school history. His first win came in the 100-yard backstroke (51.80), while the second came in 200-yard backstroke (1:53.66), which also gave him Fordham's Lombardi Pool record. Hutchinson, one of Bucknell's co-captains, swam the school's second all-time best in the 400-individual medley, which placed him third in the meet He also finished fourth in the 500-yard freestyle. While both squads were led by many outstanding individual performances, both coaches cited total team efforts as the key to success at the Championships. All 17 of the women entered and 16of the 17 men scored points in the event. Gross and Grunow led the squads in scoring with 57 and 56 points, respectively. The championship marked the first time that that many Bison swimmers had ever scored in league championships (the team competed in the East Coast Conference Championships, before switching to the Patriot League this year). Many of the swimmers' times qualified them for competition in the Eastern Championships to be held at Princeton next weekend for the women and Feb. 28-March 2 for the men. Schroth, Farrell, Steenson and Gross will team together again for two relays, while Steenson and Gross also qualified for individual competition. The women will also send a relay team to Princeton. The foursome of Hartnett, Appier, Grunow, and Falicione will compete in the200and400-yard medley relays as well as the 200 and 400-yard freestyle relays. Individually, Falcione and Grunow also qualified for the 50 and 100-yard freestyles, while Hartnett will be in the 50-yard freestyle and the 100 and 200-yard backstrokes. Colin Bridgewater/The Bucknelllan Bucknell swimmers and divers turned in outstanding performances at the inaugural Patriot League Championships held at Fordham University last weekend."
Wrestlers rebound after trip west,
Grapplers to take on Delaware tomorrow following three victories in their last four matches,"By Jam ie Diaferia Staff Writer The Bucknell grapplers began the second half of their season by competing in twelve dual meets, including seven against teams ranked among the top twenty-five in the nation. The difficulty of the schedule resulted in the Bison losing eight of their matches, and winning only four. The schedule, intended to challenge the team, appeared to be somewhat overwhelming after a series of tough west coast meets. Coach Bob Ferraro rem ained optimistic despite the losses. He looks foward to having a successful record in the conference. On January 11th, the grapplers went to Millersville where they won their first dual meet of the year. However, the Bison went on to lose their next seven matches, against North Carolina State, Cal Poly-SLO, Fresno State, Arizona State, Cal State Bakersfield, East Stroudsburg and Rider. The trip to the west coast included meets against some of the toughest schools Bucknell will face all season. Bryan Bums '91 thought the trip was still productive. ""The west coast trip prepared us well for the rest of the season against conference teams,"" he said. The loss to Rider College was the most heartbreaking thus far because the rivalry between the two schools has grown to be one of the fiercest of any Bison sports. On February 8th, the Bison turned things around by defeating Lycoming at home. They would end up winning three of their last four matches. Lycoming entered the match ranked seventeenth in Division III but proved to be no contest for the Bison. Bucknell won the dual meet 46-4 to raise their record to 2-7. The loss was just the second of the season for Lycoming. Bucknell thoroughly dominated the meet winning in nine of ten weight classes, seven of those coming by pin or technical fall. After Lycoming, the grapplers headed to Navy. In their firstmatch- up against nationally-ranked Navy, the Bison came up short, 23-12. Bucknell won three of the matches including apin by 150-pounder Mike Van Doren '92. Bucknell bounced right back and defeated William and Mary, 27- 18. The highlight of the win was in the 167-pound weight class when Tom Marchetti '91 pinned Bill Hagner in six seconds to set a Colin Bridgewater/The Bucknelllan Tri-Captain Bryan Burns '91, who is currently ranked eight in the nation, will put his 24-6 record on the line tonight against Delaware Bucknell school record. The previous with 14 falls for the season which is fastest pin was recorded by Bill good enough to be ranked eighth Cressler when he recorded a pin in 18 seconds in 1974. The pin was Marchetti's 36th of his career and 99th win. The win put him at 24-4 best in his weight class in the nation. Bucknell also recorded a win in its last dual meet of the day when it defeated Coppin State by the score Colin Bridgewater/The Bucknelllan Mike Van Doren '92 struggles to pin his opponent from Ryder earlier this season. Van Doren's season record now stands at 16-9. of 35-9. Bucknell was victorious in eight of the ten matches. The Bison victories in three of the last four matches came in the wake of their matches on Friday the 15th and Saturday the 16th against Delaware and Drexel. While Ferraro would not comment on specific upcoming matches, he seemed optimistic based on the team's performance of late. In the next two weeks, the Bison will head to Central Connecticut and Hofstra, and Ferraro believes that Bucknell has the ability to win the remaining meets this season. ""Ifeelgoodaboutourchances of winning all four meets,"" said Ferraro. ""We want to gear things towards our national schedule so that we will be ready for our conference schedule,"" including the ECWA Championships at Drexel and the NCAA Championships at Iowa. Ferraro added that the team would pursue its original goals from the start of the season, which include, most importantly, winning the conference. With victories in the upcoming matches, the Bison could conceivably accomplish this goal. Obviously the most important and difficult match in the tournament will come against Rider. ""With a victory against Rider we can still make nationals,"" Burns commented. ""People are dropping weight for the Rider match. Chris Doukas ('91 ) will be wrestling at 126. People are making sacrifices."" Individually, Ferraro would like to see the team have at least two All-Americans. Presumably, Marchetti, Burns, or Ken Herceg '91, could end the season in the top ten in the country. Bums is also currently ranked eighth in the nation and Herceg is 23-8 with 11 falls. Despite a record of 4-12, the Bison grapplers remain optimistic after victories in three of their last four matches. With four close matches coming up, Bucknell wrestlers look to improve their record to 8-12, while setting their sights on the conference championship."

Women's Hoops,"From page 16 desperately need to do. We have a big game coming up against Lehigh next Saturday, who only has one win in the league as well."" The Bison entered February aftcrabrutal month of January. They dropped all nine of their games to run their losing streak to 16 straight games. But the streak was broken in the women's first game of the month as BuckncII upset Lafayette in a conference match-up, 61-60. The women's team continued to cruise as it won its next game, an 82-71 victory over Howard, The team was led by Dec, who netted 17 points on 7-11 shooting. She also pitched in with four assists and four steals. The streak ended as the Bison lost their next contest at Holy Cross 94-68. The win gave the Lady Crusaders their eighth straight conference win to go along with an 18-5 season total. Holy Cross was led with four women in double figures. The Lady Crusaders ran away with the game as they shot 56 percent from the field. Dec led the Bison losing effort scoring 15 points while grabbing four rebounds. She was named the Patriot League Rookie of the Week for her efforts in this game as well as the game against Howard. BuckncII will have two more chances to improve its league record before running into Lehigh next Saturday. The Lady Bison will take on Fordham tomorrow. Bucknell will be looking for its first win in its tenth attempt on the road this season against the conference's second best team. Then the team will travel for another Patriot League match-up Wednesday against Colgate before they come back home to play Lehigh. Women's ""Tip-Ins"" Julie Bachman GR leads the Patriot League in three-point shooting (.49 l)...Caroline Shantz '91 needs 23 assists to pass Jen W altz into fourth place on BucknclI's all-time list."

unpredictable season,
Buckle Up For Spring Break '91,"By Jennifer Walsh Staff Writer In the world of college athletics, playing a club sport can be a pretty unpredictable experience. If you happen to play club ice hockey for Bucknell, the case may be extraordinarily so. If you do indeed play ice hockey for Bucknell, you may, for instance, find yourself and your teammates having to push a broken- down Zamboni off the ice before you can start a game. You may find yourself trying to skate through more than an inch of ""snow"" over a rut- scarred ice surface that is supposed to serve as your home rink. You may have to settle for not getting proper respect and having game's cancelled on you at the last moment. Or you many find yourself setting a bounty on an opposing team's obnoxious head coach. All of the above were the colorful events that set the scene for the Bucknell hockey team during the successful month of January in which they accum ulated a modest record of five wins and only one loss, including two very impressive late comebacks against teams from Bloomsburg and Dickinson. Playing a newly-adopted, physically-intimidating style, the team took advantage of their aggressiveness as well as a schedule laden with home games in order to create their victories. ""We got off to a really good start,"" said team co-captain Carl Zuckerberg '91, ""but lately we've been having a lot of problems getting enough guys together for games."" As a result, their record has suffered. During the month of February, Bucknell's hockey team has gone just 1-3, their only victory coming from a forfeit by Johns Hopkins University on Tuesday. It is a far cry from January's performance, in which the team's only loss came on the night of the broken-down Zamboni incident, which left the ice in such poor condition that BuckncII ' s skating ability was useless. However, that problem may soon be rectified with the very real possibility that BuckncII will be building its own skating rink on campus. Aside from that, the team's already-hurting offense was further impaired by the loss of its previously leading scorer Ben Johnson '94, who had totalled three goals early in the season before going down with a dislocated thumb and shoulder. And to compound their lack of goal-scoring, Bucknell has also had to deal with troubles in the area of goaltending. ""Our goalie [Alec Ultman '94] has been a little shaky,"" remarked team member John Guelchcr GR. ""But that's mostly because he hasn't played in four years, and that's one thing that most other teams seem to have this year, really solid goaltending."" Guelcher now finds himself leading the team in scoring with four goals and eight assists, while teammate Jamie Abrahamson '93 leads the team in goals, with eight. He is second on the team in total points with eleven. Yet despite all the team's self- criticism , the players do give themselves credit for having at least a few really strong points. ""We play very well together as a team, and we have a lot of good young players to work w ith,"" commented Zuckerberg. Aside from that, BucknclI's current record of 6-4 is good for ""about second place"" in the league, which is not bad considering that the top four out of the nine teams that make up the league will enter the playoffs for the Tournament Championship. But for Bucknell, the toughest problem they might have in making the Tournament will not be either goal-scoring or nctminding; they may have to worry the most about just staying out of the penalty box. Team members Brad Houston '93 and Bob Hauser '93 have each received two game misconducts resulting in ejections, and the entire team has taken more penalties this year than last season. But from the players' perspective, the fault is not their own, but the fault of the referees. ""We've been really unhappy with the officiating this year,"" agreed both Zuckerberg and Guelchcr. ""B ut the penalties are partly the results of playing a more physical game. Hopefully, it won't hurt us and we can still make the Tournament."" ""We'll need to come up with a very strong finish,"" add Guelchcr. ""All of the rest of our games will be big games--the league is really tight this year."" But for now, the hockey team will be concentrating on the games in the immediate future. This afternoon, Bucknell will be facing off against a talented squad from Loyola, and the hockey team will be playing their last home game of the season on Monday. ""Loyola should be tough, but beatable,"" said Guelcher. ""They have a couple of really good individuals, but they're weak defensively, and they don't play really well together."" However, the Johns Hopkins match should be an even tougher one forBuckncll. Like Loyola, Johns Hopkins has several very talented players, but they are having trouble working as a team. Yet unlike Loyola, Johns Hopkins is a proven strong checking team, which could be a problem for BucknclI's ailing offense. They have already stated a clear wish for vengeance upon Loyola, threatening to set a bounty on Jeremy Altman, Loyola's infuriating head coach. ""It should be a pretty interesting game,"" said Zuckerberg. February 15, 1991 The Bucknellian Page 15"

Bison track teams,
remain undefeated,"By Scott Brown Staff Writer With the Patriot League Championships coming up in just eight days, both the men's and women's track teams will hope to continue their winning ways. The men's team has been flawless in its four scored meets while the women have recorded two wins in two attempts. Lynette McBride '91 was pleased with the women's effort so far this season. ""I think we've done all right, but the true test will come at conferences,"" she said. The men had several spectacular performances in their last competition, the Bucknell Winter Classic, last Saturday. In a field of over twenty teams, the men were able to win three events and two Bison ran times that will qualify them for the IC4A's. In the 60-yard high hurdles, Jean Simon '94 finished just ahead of Mark Barolo '93 inatimeof 7.6 seconds. That time is the second best by a runner in the Patriot League this season. NorbertBerenyi '91 continued to run well in the mile and finished first with a time of 4:08.8, which qualified him to compete in the IC4A's. The performance was Berenyi's career best and the fifth- best mile time in Bucknell history. The Bucknell two-mile relay also won with a time of 7:58.7. Matt Deardorff '92 ran the three-mile race in 13:59.7, which only placed him in second but was still good enough to qualify him for the IC4A's. In addition Paul Austin '91 finished second in the shot put with a throw of 49'-5 3/4 "" , just four inches shy of his career best. The throw was the best throw by anyone in the conference thus far this season. The women ran tenaciously as well, winning eight events. The highlight was McBride's first place time in the 60-yard dash. Her time of See TRACK, page 15 defeated the Crusaders in Massachusetts during their winter homecoming. The back-court trio of Courtney, Fenton and Peyton combined for 50 points including a career high 13 for Peyton. Foward Mike Bright was named the game's MVP by Holy Cross officials for his 17 point, ten rebound, four steal performance. This marked the first time a non-Crusader had received the honor. Bucknell kept the momentum going with a 98-81 victory over Mount Saint Mary's on Monday. Bill Courtney tallied 30 points in the victory and Keith Fenton tied a school record with five three-pointers. The Bison led from tip-off to final buzzer. Co-captains Courtney and Fenton tallied 48 points on 12 of 19 shooting from the floor. Pat King and Paul Olkowski '93 pulled down eleven and seven rebounds, respectively. Point guard Malik Malone '91 chipped in five point in just two minutes of play. Defensively the Breakin' Bison held their opponents to under 40 per cent field goal shooting for the second straight game. Only tomorrow's opponent, Fordham, has a better defensive field goal percentage in the Patriot League. Before each game, the chalkboard in the team's locker room reads ""Defense is the key to our success."" While the defense has contributed significantly to the team's success, the Bison lead the Patriot League in scoring offense. Tomorrow, the Bison will try to keep their winning streak alive in the Bronx against Fordham. The Rams are undefeated in conference play. The Bison, however, are not intimidated. ""We're finding different ways to win. The team is starting to come together,"" remarked Fenton. If the team keeps finding ways said Kelly Dee '94. Dee led the Bison with 20 points and four steals. ""No matter how much pressure we put on their guards they were able to throw it into their big people and it was just too hard for us to defend. I think once we went to our full court pressure we were a little more successful, but we may have waited too long to do it"" Earlier in the week the Lady Bison lost a close game to Canisius 74-70, despite an 18 point performance from Julie Bachman GR. Bucknell trailed Canisius at the half 37-27, and were able to pull to within six points down the stretch, but just couldn't come up with the big play after Juliet McGee '93, who had 15 points for the game, fouled out with three minutes left to play. Again Bucknell was plagued with poor shooting and turnovers. The team shot just 33 percent for the game and have 21 turnovers. Dee chipped in with 14 points in defeat. ""Everything was in our favor,"" said coach Lori Howard, ""we had more rebounds, shots, steals, but we justdidn t shoot well. It's hard to win games when you only shoot 33 percent from the field."" ""Right now our goal is to get out of the basem ent in the conference,"" she added. Realistically we could get up to sixth in the conference, which we See Women's Hoops, page 14"
Breakin' Bison win third straight,"Ashley Chertkof/The Bucknellian Mike Bright '93 nets two of his sixteen over Mount St. M ary's John Miller. The win was the Bison's second in their current three-game winning streak and fourteenth for the season. By Dave Riggs and Todd Bianchine Staff Writers By Kirk Peters Bucknell's men's basketball squad increased its current winning streak to three games with a 69-51 thrashing of Army on Wednesday night in Davis Gym. The win lifted the Breakin Bison'soverall record to 15-10 and put them in a third-place tie with Holy Cross in the Patriot League at 5-3. The game featured two vastly different halves. In the first half, Bucknell jumped out to an 8-0 lead behind a Mike Bright '93 three- pointer and one-handed jam and another three-pointer from Bill Courtney '92. After this strong start, however, Army began to control the tempo with a deliberate offense and physical inside play. ""We got out to an eight point lead and we thought we were going to shoot it out. You can't do that against somebody as physical as they are,"" remarked head coach Charlie Woolum. Dave Ardafiyo led Army's charge with ten points, and seven boards in the first half. Mike Bright's tenpointsforB ucknell kept the B ison close and they went into the locker room with a 26-24 deficit. ""We knew they were going to be deliberate,"" said co-captain Keith Fenton '91. ""We played well enough defensively, but we were too impatient when we got the ball on offense. At half-time, we talked about being more patient and getting better shots."" The half-time strategy proved effective as the Bison exploded in the second half. Two free throws and a three-pointer by Fenton knotted the score at 29. Then, over the next seven minutes, the Bison went on a 17-2 run to which all five starters contributed. Two threes by Fenton and a thunderous dunk by Bright highlighted the rally. After taking a 48-33 lead, Bucknell never looked back. Mike Bright had a tremendous all-around game with 16 points, three rebounds, three assists, two blocks, and seven steals. Keith Fenton finished with 13 points, all in the second half. Patrick King, in yet another solid effort, collected 14 points and 10 boards. While most of the students were beginning their classes back in Lewisburg, the Bison were learning ACC basketball in Winston-Salem, NC. After a quick five point run to start the game, Bucknell found itself down 43-26 at the half. Wake Forrest's bigger and faster athletes, such as ACC Rookie of the Year to-be, Rodney Rogers, built up its lead to as much as 29 points. ""He's everything thateveryone says he is,"" commented Woollum at the post-game press conference. The Bison, led by Courtney's 31 points, managed to cut the Deamon Deacon's lead to only nine with just under three m inutes to play, bcforeWake went on a 9-2 run to close out the game 83-67. Since returning north, the Bison are playing some of their best basketball of the season as they head down the stretch. The team has rebounded from some early conference losses, including a tough one to Fordham and a heart-breaker at the buzzer to Holy Cross. The Bison avenged that earlier loss to Holy Cross last Saturday as they The women's basketball team suffered another tough defeat last Wednesday as they took a 72-52 drubbing at the hands of Army led by three players who scored in double figures. The loss drops Buckncll's record to 2-19 with a 1-7 record in Patriot League play. Army jumped out to a 6-0 lead and never looked back. Paced by a dominating offensive attack in thepaintandanextremely aggressive man-to-man defense, Army exploited the young backcourt of Bucknell, who turned the ball overa total of 30 times throughout the game. The Lady Knights' tenacious play led them to a 43-28 halftime margin. Army was sparked at the midway point by Jennifer Hankes who came off the bench to score ten points. The turnovers were the difference at this point. Only Bucknell's 53 percent field goal shooting was keeping them in the game. Army went on an 10-0 run early in the second half getting 6 points from Hankes and four from Christine Chandler. The Bison continued to turn the ball over and also began to get cold from the file. They only connected on seven of 26 shots in the second half. ""They were a really big team,"" Peter Ho/The Bucknellian Co-Captain Caroline Shantz '91 penitrates past a Canisius defender during the second-half of the Lady Bison's 74-70 loss last Monday night. Shantz's reverse layup with only 27 seconds lifted her team to its first victory of the season over Lafayete, 61-60, on Feb. 2."

"Alumni must raise $ 150,000 by May 1 to keep house","By Sue Basalla Staff Writer As a part of the guest preacher program, Martin Luther King spoke in Rooke Chapel on April 23,1958. Although described in the April 17, 1958 Bucknellian as ""one of the most admired religious leaders of the world in a recent gallup poll,"" King was billed on the chapel program as simply the President of the Montgomery Improvement Association (MIA). King organized the MIA in order to co-ordinate the Montgomery, Alabamabusprotests. This 381-day boycott of the bus system stemmed from Rosa Park's now-famous refusal to sit in the ""black"" section of a public bus. The protests resulted in the desegregation of Montgomery's public buses and the MIA later evolved into King's Southern Christian Association. Focusing upon religion rather than civil rights, King delivered a sermon entitled ""The Three Dimensions of a Complete Life"" at the weekly Wednesday morning chapel service. The May 1,1958 issue of the Bucknellian summarized King's speech as calling for the integration of personal fulfillment, altruism and spirituality. Courtesy of W. W .

Vandalism plagues campus;,
DeCerchio ponders causes,
"It's become kind of a pasttime, coming",
back to the dorm at two or three in the,
"morning and pulling the fire alarm.""","By Tara Gilligan Staff Writer According to Vince DeCerchio, director of security and safety, incidences of campus vandalism have risen in recent months. The noticeable increase frustrates DeCerchio, who is unable to determ ine reasons for the growing numberof vandalisms. ""We have a higher _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ incidence of vandalism on campus than usual,"" he said. T h e c a m p u s v a n d a l i s m comes primarily -- - in two forms: broken windows and falsely activated fire pull stations. The most recent exam ples of vandalism occured over the weekend. ""There were quite a few windows broken just last weekend,"" said Bob Millward, manager of buildings. In addition to breaking windows, vandals tore down two plexiglass signs in the Bertrand Library. The cost of vandalism may be what affects students the most ""I would say vandalism at Bucknell runs about $ 15,000 to $30,000"" in a period of nine months, Millward estimated. Millward said part of the University's budget includes money to cover vandalism. However, the budgetary figure covers less than a third of the costs incurred by vandals each year. As incidences of vandalism increase, the cost of repairs ""has to be tacked on to the yearly operating cost of the university and it has to be tacked on to students' tuitions and benefits and resources,"" said DeCerchio. The cost of replacing broken windows, a common form of campus vandalism, varies. Replacing small window panes runs about $11, including labor. On. Jan. 15, vandals broke four large plate glass windows outside the Boswick dining hall of the Langone Center. M illward estimates that to replace each broken pane will cost $850, for a total of $3400. Without knowing the motives which lead to acts of vandalism, DeCerchio finds it difficult to reduce incidences. ""Part of my job is to apprehend the students who are doing it, but I don't know if punishment in itself can really change people,"" he said. ""We'd have a better chance of resolving these types of problems if we really got at the source. What is it that causes people to do that?"" he said. DeCerchio suggested that resentment of authority, being away from home, and alcohol abuse may be at the source of the problem. One thing that statistics do clearly indicate, however, is that ""the majority of cases involve underclassmen - freshmen and sophomores - who are intoxicated,"" said DeCerchio. DeCerchio cited a study done by Cornell University about 10 years ago which revealed that most campus vandalism, throughout the nation, has been committed by students under the influence of alcohol. The same Hi seems to be true today on Bucknell's campus, according to DeCerchio. ""There's a statistical basis for connecting alcohol to vandalism and I'm concerned about it,"" he said. DeCerchio also said he wondered ""what it is that affects these people so that when they get drunk they become destructive. I think that as they get older they may want to examine that behavior."" D eC erchio classifies a large number of incidents as ""very angry vandalisms."" He cited, as an ""  example, one student who tossed ""a rock or a brick through a large plate glass window of the [Langone Center]."" One of the most common types of vandalism comes in the form of falsely activating pull stations, which alert security of the possibility of a fire, as well as the expending of fire extinguishers for apparently no"
--Vince DeCerchio,"reason. See VANDALISM, page 2 By Bob Ritter Staff writer The nearly three-year battle among the Bucknell alumni of Phi Kappa Psi fraternity over whether to sell the Pennsylvania Gamma chapter house to the University will be resolved by the end of the current semester. As the long-running battle among Phi Psi alumni in and out of the courts winds to a close, f r a t e r n i t y representatives are also beginning their efforts to -- recolonize the chapter. Paul Pigman '56, president of the Phi Kappa Psi Alumni House Corporation, acknowledged this week that the alumni group wishing toblock the sale of the house to the University has been granted a final extension on their deadline to raise $150,000 for the house's restoration. Following a campus meeting of the two sides Monday, Pigman said that the House Retention Committee ""is insisting on another 60 days to raise the money"" demanded by the Corporation to halt the sale. With thenew May 1 deadline, Pigman admitted, ""I have no faith we have any chance to get ready [for occupancy] for the fall."" Pigman explained that ""negotiations are complete, and ' Bucknell is patiently waiting until the Alumni Corporation decides what it's doing"" to sign an agreement which would turn ownership of the house over to the University at a repair cost not to exceed $350,000. Barry Maxwell, vice president for administration, said that under the best circumstances ""it is conceivable"" that the house could be occupied next fall, but ""that would depend on how quickly forces were mobilized, and how quickly the [Phi Psi] decision is conveyed"" to the University. If the common areas were completed by September, but the residential rooms were not yet available, Maxwell said it was ""unlikely that anyone, Phi Psi or Bucknell, could occupy part of the house"" while construction continued"
"""If you own something you take better",
"care of it, you respect it, it becomes a part",
of you. If the University owns it it just,
"becomes a boarding house.""",
-- Dale Shuggart '69,
House Retention Committee chairman,"in other areas. Negotiations were repeatedly held up during the last two years as Phi Kappa Psi national and individual Penn Gamma alumni attempted to take the Alumni Corporation to court to block the sale. As a result of the court action, the Alumni Corporation has set the May 1 deadline for the group to have ""a minimum of $150,000 in the bank--not pledged--in the bank,"" Pigman explained. He ""suspects they will"" fail in their efforts, and believes that ""we may very well know by April 1 "" that the group will be unable to raise the necessary funds. Dale Shuggart '69, chairman of the Penn Gamma House Retention Committee, explained that the drive, which ""started justovera month ago,"" has netted $30,000 in pledges to date. Shuggart said ""it is impossible to tell"" if the effort will be successful, although hedoesbelieve""most people favor keeping [the house], it's just a question of whether the money is there."" He explained that the House Retention Committee's plan calls for the money raised to cover ""about half the repairs,"" and to be accompanied by ""a continuing fund raising effort over the next two years,"" while ""everything else would balance out"" financially if the house is fully occupied. Colonization efforts begin When the chapter was closed in 1988 the University declared that the group would be allowed to reorganize this past fall; because of the intra-chapter squabble and the present overhaul of the social/ r e s i d e n t i a l system, the starting date was pushed back to the beginning of this year's fall semester. Ron Richard, Phi Kappa Psi director of chapter services, explained that officials from the national office will be on campus ""to recruitan interest group.. .throughout the spring."" Richard, who is ""very positive"" about the effort, added, ""I think we're going to have a lot of success."" He explained that the fraternity was not allowed to have any contact with students until the beginning of this semester, although several students had contacted the Office of Residential Life to inquire about the chapter. Richard held an informational meeting with these students on Feb. 13 to explain the upcoming process and because ""we wanted it to be clear we are founding a brand new group."" He wanted to hold the meeting before the end of rush to give ample opportunity to students ""who decide they want a more traditional fraternity experience,"" rather than helping to recolonize the chapter. Richard explained that a ""national leadership party"" will be on campus for an ""initial process [which] takes about three weeks,"" and See PHI PSI, psge 2"
Academic dishonesty increases,
"Faculty, administration view problems as minimal","Ashley Chertkof/The Bucknellian While Director of Security and Safety Vince DeCerchio admits he does not understand the motivation behind acts of vandalism, he explains ""the majority of cases involve underclassmen...who are intoxicated."" By Bob Minnich Staff Writer The number of academic dishonesty cases for this semester has increased marginally but not by enough to cause alarm according to Larry Shinn, vice president for academic affairs. The Board on Academic Responsibility reported that a total of 67 cases of academic dishonesty were addressed first semester. The mostcommon offense was the signing of false statements by students. Forty-one students charged were found guilty and received as punishment a course grade reduced by one-third. Other cases of academic dishonesty involved cheating on exams, copying class assignments or lab reports, inappropriate collaboration irresponsibility, and plagiarism. Of the nine incidents of cheating on exams, one student was found not guilty, one received a zero for the exam and consultation with Psychological Services, and one received a class grade lowered by one grade letter. Three individuals were given a ""W"" for their course grades. The Board of Review on Academic Responsibility is the University's official body which decides whether the students charged are guilty or innocent of any charges of academic irresponsibility. Three faculty members and two students comprise the Board. The faculty members are elected by Bucknell's Student Government (BSG) for staggered three-year terms. The two student representatives are chosen by the BSG. The disciplinary process involves the Board, the student, the professor, and the deans of thecollege of arts and sciences and the college of engineering. In assigning penalties, the Board of Review considers precendents set by similar cases. It is assumed that repeated offenses result in increasingly severe punishments. The Board may assign punishments from a list ranging from the rewriting of an assignment or exam without the lowering of a letter grade to the permanent expulsion of the guilty student from the University. Despite the cases of cheating and plagiarism, faculty members indicate that academic dishonesty is the exception among Bucknell students. Ralph Droms, assistant professor of comuter science, acknow ledged ""We don ' t spend a lot of time worrying about academic dishonesty among the students. We don't spend a lot of time devising mechanisms to avoid academic dishonesty problems."" Droms did, however, exper ience academic dishonesty within one ofhisclasses. A student handed in an assignment that was obviously not the student's own work. Droms indicated that this incident was rare, stating that ""I haven't changed anything that I've been doing based on this one problem."" Martin Sklar, professor of history, said that academic dishonesty has""rarelybeenaproblem."" Bucknell students are ""intelligent and honest."" Sklar stated that he encourages a ""collaborativeeffortand interchange of ideas"" as important for scholarship. Maureen Murphy, associate dean of the College of Arts and Sciences, remarked that ""there's a need for awareness of the issues of what is involved with academic responsibility."" Murphy remarked that cheating is not frequently See DISHONESTY, page 2"

Vandalism,"From page 1 When vandals expend fire extinguishers without cause, they endanger the lives of others around them, according to DeCerchio. Fire extinguishers cannot be recharged immediately, leaving a hall vulnerable to fire until the following morning. Even more of a concern to DeCerchio is the ""unbelievable amount"" of falsely activated pull stations. Between Jan. 1 and Feb. 5., security responded to 32 false alarms in residence halls. ""I'm afraid to talk about them. Sometimes when you talk about a problem and you note that it is a problem, for some reason some people get really egged on to do it m ore,"" he said, justifying his hesitancy to discuss the issue. Although in the immediate picture, the false alarms are simply a nuisance to residents and to security, danger comes when students choose to ignore fire alarms which might be signalling a real fire. ""The problem with false fire alarms is that after a while people... become conditioned to the fact that there are a high number of false fire alarms and after a while, occupants of a residence or a dormitory won'tevacuate anymore,"" said DeCerchio. Rather than evacuate the building each time the alarm sounds, DeCerchio says some students put on headphonesorgo back to sleep. Some even wait until they see smoke, he said, which is dangerous because smoke alarms will detect smoke long before students would be able to see it."

Phi Psi,"As with other types of vandalism, DeCerchio attributes the activation of pull stations to intoxicated students. ""It's become kind of a pasttime, coming back to the dorm at twoor three in the morning and pulling the fire alarm. I'm sure that persons whodoitmaynotal ways have malicious intent; they think they're funny,"" he said. Students who are caught activating pull stations will be turned over to the police for arrest and prosecution. Persons who commit other campus vandals are dealt with by the University judicial system, DeCerchio said. In addition to problems with broken windows and activated pull stations campus vandalism has taken other forms as well. ""People drive their cars all over campus,"" said Mill ward. Also, DeCerchio pointed out a problem with people shooting BB guns at windows. He referred specifically to an incident which occured on Feb. 3 in which a BB punctured the windshield of a car parked outside Smith Hall Mill ward spoke of other minor vandalisms, such as the breaking of vending machines. In December, USA Today reported Bucknell as having the highest campus crime rate in the state per 1,000 students. Vice President for Administration Barry Maxwell and DeCerchio called the report misleading because it counted vandalism and petty thefts, which other universities may not have included in their crime statistics. From page 1 involves ""one-on-one interviews with interested parties"" to determine their suitability for ""the kind of fraternity experience we want to offer."" Richard was unconcerned about the possibility that the house may not be livable by September, explaining, ""Certainly we consider the chapter separate from the house. We are not recruiting to fill the house."" Sale triggers alumni dispute The sale of the house has been an extremely controversial issue within the ranks of the Penn Gamma alumni, and was the cover story of the Fall 1990 issue of The Shield of Phi Kappa Psi, the national alumni magazine. In that article, a poll of Penn Gamma alumni revealed that 97 percent of those surveyed preferred to have the alumni corporation retain the house, while only three percent supported the sale of the property to Bucknell. The national fraternity attacked the transfer cost, which it estimated as four percent of the house's actual replacement value, as ""giving [the property] to the University."" This is essentially the case, as Maxwell explained that the Alumni Corporation would transfer title without com pensation to the University, which would then pay for all repairs necessary to make the property available to the new Phi Psi colony. Maxwell said that the University has estimated it would have to spend $335,000 to complete repairs on the house; he also explained that the Physical Plant estimate is from fall 1988, and would probably have to be scaled upward. According to Maxwell, a number of repairs are needed to bring the property to University standards because the current condition of the house is due to a slow process of deterioration which includes ""damage done by theactives at that time [1988], coupled with damage from neglect [in upkeep] and problems over the last two years"" in which the house was unattended. In an interview last fall, Pigman justified the sale by explaining that ""Bucknell will be able to manage the facility in a more prudent manner"" because administrators are in close daily contact with the fraternity, and ""it was the [unchecked] behavior of the students that caused the whole problem in the first place."" Shuggart believes that keeping"
Dishonesty,"the house in the control of the fraternity is essential because ""if you own something you take better care of it, you respect it, it becomes a part of you. If the University owns it it just becomes a boarding house."" While acknowledging that ""I understand where they [the Alumni Corporation] are coming from,"" he believes that a repeat of the problems which led to the loss of the charter could be prevented by a more attentive alumni. He said, ""Most of us feel that if you've got a group of people who have graduated and done well, they can do something to supplement the University. If we stay closer, maybe we can enhance the educational and social opportunities of the University."" The national organization has charged that the proposed agreement offers no firm guarantee that the chapter can occupy the house. Phi Psi chapters at Stanford University and Dickinson and Franklin & Marshall Colleges have lost their houses because their property transfer agreements did not contain explicit renewal options. In the Shield article, the executive council said that the University could remove the house on four months' notice if it decides on a non-residential use, and that there is no renewal option following the initial ten-year lease. Pigman, however, explained that Phi Psi's right to the house can only be revoked by a vote of the Board of Trustees. Legal battles delay action The Phi Kappa Psi house has been closed since May 18,1988, when the national organization revoked the Penn Gamma chapter's charter following repeated disciplinary problems. Pigman and the Alumni Corporation first approached the University about purchasing the house the following fall, but negotiations were halted when other Penn Gamma alumni went to court to block the transfer of the house. The legal hurdles were cleared in August of last year when a petition by aPenn Gammaalumnus to dissolve the Alumni Corporation was dismissed by the courts. The national executivecouncil, originally a party to the suit, continued to support the action after it was dismissed from the petition in March 1989, when Union County Common Pleas Judge James F. McClure ruled that the council had no legal interest to initiate the action. From page 1 intended, and referred to the ""heat of the moment"" in an act of academic dishonesty. The pressure does not excuse the cheating; students must recognize this pressure and plan their time better so that any pressure may be minimized. Lany Shinn, vice president for academic affairs, echoed Murphy's comments concerning the scope of the academic dishonesty issue. Shinn says dishonesty is a concern for two reasons. First, ""honesty is at the heart of what we assume when we enter academic covenants with students."" ""The lifeblood"" of the University involves ""a free exchange of ideas"" resting ""upon the pillars of honesty and free speech."" The second issue involves university funding from agencies. Shinn mentioned that Bucknell instituted a formal procedure of how to deal with academic responsibility last year in order to receive research funding from the National Institutes of Health. In response to the problem, the University community has altered certain practice to stress the importance of honest scholarship. Shinn stated that there is now agreater stress about academic dishonesty at orientation and an increased attempt to define academic dishonesty in the Student Handbook. The faculty is also clarifying cases of what they consider acceptable within their own classes. Shinn said that incidents of plagiarism and cheating are always a concern but that ""there are marginally more cases, butnot enough to concern us."" Trudy Cunningham, associate dean of engineering, linked the problem at Bucknell with the larger problem faced by all college campuses. Cunningham said that Bucknell does not experience as much academic dishonesty as other campuses, but the cases that do occur disturb the sense of community. Professors consider incidents of cheating a ""personal offense."" Cunningham characterized Bucknell's academic disciplinary system as ""more educational"" than those of other universities. The goal is to educate the student to the seriousness of the incident and to ensure that the student will remain an honest member of the Bucknell community."
Correction:,"In the December 7th issue of The Bucknellian, a news brief entitled Police fine TKE for Vrelations"" claimed that MarkRoessler was charged with and plead guilty to providing alcohol to minors, the article should have read that TKE was charged with providing alcohol to minors and Mark Roessler plead guilty on behalf of the fraternity. The Bucknellian R egrets the error. ______________________________________________ ^"

Environmental lawyer,
to discuss Clean Air Act,"By Julie L. Shurilla Environmental issues have been brought increasingly to the forefront of our awareness, and environmental laws will affect people in industry and business as well as those involved in politics. In his lecture entitled, ""Policy and Political Implications of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990,"" attorney Jeffrey Miller will discuss the effects of new environmental legislation. The lecture, which is sponsored by the Environmental College, will take place at 7 p.m. on Monday in the Gallery Theatre in the Langone Center. It will be followed by a reception at 8 p.m. in the Faculty Lounge. Jeffrey M iller, an environmental lawyer, is currently a professor at Pace University School of Law, one of the leading institutes for the study of environmental law. A graduate of Harvard Law School, Miller has worked for various private law firms and for the federal Environmental Protection Agency. He has published a book and several articles on environmental law issues, and he has become one of the most respected authorities on environmental law. Last fall, the Clean Air Act Amendments were a hotly debated issue. The amendments will produce an immeasurable effect on the environment. According to Stephen Stamos, professor of international relations, the amendments will also have a tremendous economic effect. Stamos said that the cost for businesses to adhere to the new amendments could be enormous, although the degree of its influence on our economic system could be minimal. Penny Puskarich '92, a junior fellow with the Environmental College,commented that this legislation is a test of President Bush's campaign promises to address environmental concerns. Since the Carter administration, Puskarich said, there has been almost no action on environmental issues from the executive office. Environmentalists hope that increasing awareness of these issues throughout the U.S. will lead to a greater amount of protective legislation, but there is some doubt as to how effective that legislation will be. Miller's lecture will focus on the political impact of the 1990 amendments, and the reception will provide an opportunity for students and faculty to talk personally with him about Pace University and the field of environmental law."
"DeCerchio, students draft",
alcohol enforcement policy,
Build your resum e-,
write for,
The Bucknellian,"By Tommy Abel Staff Writer Vince DeCerchio and the Student Security Advisory Committee have completed their revisions of Bucknell's new Alcohol Policy Enforcement Procedures for Special Events and Social Activities. This new policy addresses many aspects of such events, including event registration, the enforcement procedures, the nature of the complaints and violations check sheet, reasonable cause to enter an event, and a statute of limitations regarding the filing and disposition of charges. DeCerchio commented that he ""built this draft within the context of reasonable guidlines from a security and police viewpoint."" The revised pol icy is the result of student concerns over equitable and fair dealings between the University organizations sponsoring social events in which alcohol is served. DeCerchio sent the original draft of the revisions to 14 student leaders and campus organizations. DeCerchio stated, ""I sent a memo out to all student organizations, the IFC officers, and to m ost of the administrativedepartmentsasking for their input and for their participation with the advisory committee."" Each then returned the draft, including their input and criticisms, to DeCerchio. After receiving their comments, he met with the Student Advisory Committee to finalize the draft. He believed student input would help ensure the validity of Security's proposal. And he added, ""Every member of the community agreed that the guidelines were reasonable."" Under the new rules, on the night of an event, security will perform two checks: one between 11 p.m. and midnightand another be tween 2a.m. and 3 a.m. When the security officer arrives at the event, he or she will request to see the ""event sponsor or organization officer."" The event sponsor will then accompany the officer to the segregated area ""where the officer will evaluate the area, occupants, and monitor."" As in the past, alcohol service is to stop at 2 a.m., all indoor music (live and recorded) is also to stop at 2 a.m,, and the event should be completely concluded by 3 a.m. While, the above situation refers to a fraternity-type party, the policy clearly states that ""the same enforcement procedures will apply to all student-sponsored events serving alcohol, including residence hall events."" DeCerchio's new policy also defined 'reasonable cause' for the Bucknell community. DeCerchio stated that ""those guidelines arc ones used by most police departments."" He went on to state that he believed the problems of the past were due to ""unfortunate breakdowns in communication."" Again, the definition of reasonable cause was created by DeCerchio in conjunction with other student leaders and organizations. Reasonable cause is defined in six parts as follows: 1. To respond to a fire alarm or fire emergency. 2. To respond to a physical plant emergency. 3. To respond to an excessive overcrowding situation. 4. To respond to a crime in progress, a crime which has occurred, or activities indicating that a crime occurred or is occurring at an event or in a house. 5. To respond to a disorderly conduct situation or inappropriate behavior visible from outside the Professional Cleaning Services C le a n in g  h o m e s , a p a rtm en ts, fra ts, e tc .

Bush rejects,
Soviet proposal,"President Bush said Tuesday that Gorbachev's formula for the Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait is inadequate. Bush did not outright reject the letter, but sent a detailed response to Moscow. He did claim, however, that the formula ""falls short of what would be required"" to end the war with Iraq. Baghdad did not publicly reply to Moscow's formula for ending the war. Tariq Aziz, Iraq's foreign minister, reiterated the proposal Baghdad announced last Friday to withdraw from Kuwait. He again listed the conditions allies have called unacceptable. Aziz called Friday's offer ""a serious step on which we still insist."" Aziz is expected to return to Moscow on Wednesday. Until an official response comes from Baghdad, allied forces may decide not to engage in ground combat. The Soviet Union's foreign minister, Aleksandr Bessmertnykh, warned that a ground war could complicate matters. Bush said the negotiations would have no effect on the war. ""As far as I'm concerned, there are no negotiations. The goals have been set out. Therewillbenoconcessions,"" he said."
Yeltsin demands,
Gorbachev's,
resignation,"In a nationally televised address Tuesday night, Boris Yeltsin, president of the Russian republic, called for the resignation of Soviet President M ikhail Gorbachev. Yeltsin reminded the Soviet people of Gorbachev's ""tendency toward political power."" After much negotiating to establish a time for Yeltsin to appear on nationwide television,he delivered a speech which ripped into the Soviet president and his ""anti-people policy."" Yeltsin also asked the Soviet public to support his demands that the Kremlin power be turned over to the Federation Council, which is dominated by republics striving to secure independence. Yeltsin called for Gorbachev's resignation after the leader relied on traditional Kremlin support and military might to maintain control in states leaning towards self sovereignty. Last month, Gorbachev defended the use of army tanks in Vilnius where 15 armed persons died while demonstrating for Lithuanian independence."
I.R.A. bombs hit,
London stations,"Two bombs, placed by the Irish Republican Army (I.R.A.), exploded in a central London railroad station Tuesday, killing one man and wounding 40 others. One bomb exploded at 7:40 a.m. in Victoria Station, crowded with commuters headed into the city from London's southern suburbs. The bomb had been hidden in a trash can and sprayed glass and shrapnel when it exploded. Another bomb had exploded several hours earlier in Paddington station, but caused no casualties. Government officials say the recently increasing threat of IRA terrorist acts marks an intensification of the group's attempts to force Britain out of Northern Ireland. Tuesday's bombings, which caused the first civilian casualties inflicted by the organization in seven years, came just 11 days after the mortar attack on 10 Downing Street which missed Prime Minister John Major and his war cabinet"
Drug makers,
refuse discount,"Congress recently passed a law which requires that Medicaid be given the same discounts drug companies grant to other businesses. Rather than reduce the rates of drug prices to Medicaid, drug companies have chosen to circumscribe the law by drastically raising the prices of drugs they sell, even to big customers. Large prescription drug buyers have sometimes negotiated 25 to 60 percent reductions in prices from suppliers. In the last decade, however, Medicaid, the federal-state health program for indigents, has paid significantly more for prescriptions. Drug makers have increased the price of prescriptions, affecting such groups as the Department of Veterans Affairs. The new law, which went into effect Jan. 1, requires drug makers to offer state Medicaid programs the lowest price charged to any of their customers. The Congress Budget Office estimated in October that discounts to Medicaid would save the federal government $1.9 billion over five years. Itestimatcdthatslates would save $1.4 billion in that time."
States debate,
governor terms,"VermontandRhode Island, two of three states which still hold gubernatorial elections every two years, have renewed debates over the length of governors' terms. One former Vermont governor, Thomas Salmon, claims two years is not a long enough term; governors barely settle into the office before they must begin campaigning again, he said. ""You've got to have time to do strategic thinking and planning and two years is a tiny time frame to deal with major issues,"" he said. Others argue that the short terms keep governors in touch with voters. One advocate of the present two year term said that the issue would be resolved by better planning on the part of the governors elected. A change in term lengths in either state would require a constitutional amendment which includes both legislative approval and a voter referendum."
Congress may,
cut spending,"Congress will have to cut spending on domestic programs to offset the costs of new benefits for veterans of the Persian Gulf war Richard Darman, director of the Office of Management and Budget, said Wednesday. Darman told Congress that it will have to find means of financing new benefits for the veterans. His warning may lim it Congress's enthusiasm for generous new benefit programs designed to show support for the troops in the Middle East. If Congress does not come up w ith al tentative funding for these new programs, the budget law, signed by President Bush on Nov. 5, would require across-the-board cuts in many domestic programs such as Medicare, farm price supports, and guaranteed loans for college students."

Tribal art included in Gallery exhibit,"r . By Ted Sterling Wandering down the short corridor on the third floor of the ELC to the entrance of the Center Gallery, there is a sense that one is entering a different and exciting world. This effect is achieved by the assorted religious and spiritual artworks from several South American countries that are seen on both sides of the hall. There is much more in store, though, for those who pass through the doors of the Gallery, for the South American works are only the preliminary step in a journey through place and time. Just before entering the gallery, one reads a quote by Carl Jung which states, ""All cultures have tried to record the immemorial. Because there are innumerable things beyond the range of human understanding, we constantly use symbolic terms to represent concepts that we cannot fully comprehend."" These words are the basis for the current exhibit in the Gallery entitled ""Divinations -- Transcendent Images from Africa, South America, and the United States."" Stepping into the gallery, one stands before an assortment of contemporary artwork by various American artists. On the opposite side of the gallery, enclosed in glass, is the heart of the exhibit. Here is a wide range of tribal and ritualistic art from Africa, what has historically been labeled ""prim itive"" art. However, in recent years it has been argued that the word ""primitive"" is misleading, since, as stated by Center Gallery director Robert Metzger, this African art stems ""from systems of belief and value patterns which are not primitive."" A more accurate and genius of African artists is one of the widely accepted term for African highpoints of art history."" It is tribal and ritualistic art is difficult, however, to experience the ""humanistic."" full spiritual and mystical effect of"
"""All cultures have tried to record the",

--Carl Jung,"Courtesy of Public Relations ""Divinations--Transcendent Images from Africa, South America, and the United States"" is on exhibit in the Center Gallery through April 14. This is a unique exhibit in the respect that the art comes from so many different places and times. According to Metzger, the common thread between all the works, alluded to in the words of Jung, lies in the shared values of all the artists including ""the search for beauty and order in life, personal communal prestige, [and a fascination by] the mystery of death,"" among others. In a few cases, one can even see the influence on contemporary U.S. artists by their hum anistic predecessors in Africa. The African pieces, mostly ceremonial statues and masks, represent only ""the tip of the iceberg of the brilliance of African art,"" says Metzger, who also believes that ""the"
Alum returns for playwriting residency,"By Maria Glod Playwright David Hancock has been conducting playwriting workshops this month as a guest anist-in-residence with the Dept, of Theatre & Dance. An alum of Bucknell, Hancock graduated in 1984 and then went on to attain a master's degree in Fine Arts from the University of Iowa play writing program. A public reading of material from his workshops will be presented Thursday, Feb. 28 at 8 p.m. in the University Theatre at Coleman Hall. Hancock began his college education as an animal behavior major, but his ever-present love for the theatre pulled him toward a career in playwriting. He feels that the Bucknell Theatre Department provides a unique experience in that it allows undergraduate students to actively take part in major productions. The fall of his senior year, Hancock himself staged an original work, Chevy Death, with the support and guidance of his professors. Hancock'splays deal with his own life and personal experiences. He believes writers should be ""sensitive about their own intuitions and memories."" Based on the life of a drifting folk artist, his play, The Conventions of Cartography, will be performed the first weekend in March with performances Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m., and Sunday at2 p.m. and 8 p.m. in the University Theatre at Coleman Hall. Tickets are $3.50, $2.00 with a student discount."

One gets the feeling that the works should be seen as they were intended to be not in a college art gallery, but in a ritualistic ceremony held by an African tribe. The exhibit, due to the predominant role of the African art, coincides with Black History Month. It should also beduly noted that much of the African art has been supplied by Pulitzer Prize-winningplaywright and patron of the arts Edward Albee, without whom the show might not have materialized.

Electric Phoenix satisfies,
adventurous audience,"By Michael Boatwright The British vocal ensemble Electric Phoenix presented last Friday's Weis Center audience with a performance rooted in immense virtuosity, yet delivered with incredible sensitivity, emotion, and fun. This statement holds great import for Elec trie Phoen ix because they specialize in the often unappreciated avant-garde music. New music is often considered difficult to understand and enjoy due to its complexities and abstract qualities. Yet, Electric Phoenix dispelled this myth with a performance that was extremely fascinating and quite satisfying. Of particular interest to the Bucknell members of the audience was the inclusion in the program of the Rooke Chapel Choir under direction of William Payn, as well as the performance of a piece by Professor of Music William Duckworth, Songs of the Pale Horseman. The Rooke Chapel Choir stood in the balcony as it participated in the extremely sensitive performance of Benjamin Britten's A Hymn to the Virgin. This effective placement of the Choir served to highlight the call and response aspect of the piece. Both Electric Phoenix and the Chapel Choir maintained impeccable intonation and balance even separated by the length of the Weis Center. One of the more memorable pieces of the evening, Songs of the Pale Horseman is Duckworth's exploration of Death as one of the Four Horseman of the Apocalypse. Duckworth's collage of diverse music and textprovided an excellent stage for Electric Phoenix's a cappclla virtuosity. Using a variety of vocal techniques ranging from the simple falsetto to strange vocal inflections, the quartet effectively painted a musical picture of the many aspects and emotions of death. The perform ance was entertaining in spite of the common criticism associated with avant- garde music. Labeled as remote from more popular forms of music, some claim that, in the Classical sense, twentieth century music is not ""music"" at all. Other critics also complain that one almost needs to be a pure connoisseur in order to appreciate the music's subtleties. It is up to the individual, however, to determine the validity of these criticisms. What cannot be argued is the superior ability of Electric Phoenix to present this controversial art form in a pleasant manner. The group richly rewards the adventuresome audience willing to invest the energy required to experience an evening of New music."

'Master Harold'... and the,
Boys,
to be performed tonight,
Black History Month festivities include intense drama,"By Laura Grisin The Asolo Theatre Company will present 'Master Harold'... and the Boys, an award-winning play by South African Athol Fugard, tonight at 8 p.m. in the Weis Center. This powerful drama centers around Hally, a white South African boy, and the two black tea-room waiters, Sam and Willy, who work for his parents. The servants have established a significant relationship with the boy as surrogate fathers since his natural father is hospitalized as a crippled alcoholic. The relaxed atmosphere suddenly turns tense when Hally hears that his father is returning home from the hospital. He dreads the inevitable clashes that will result, and, unable to vent his confusion and anger at his father, he lashes out at Sam, thereby jeopardizing one of his most meaningful friendships. As described by Frank Rich of The NewYorkTimes, what occurs is ""an unstoppable, almost unwatchable outpouring of ugliness, in which Hally humiliates the black man he loves by insisting that he call him 'Master Harold,' by mocking their years of shared secrets, by spitting in his face."" He adds that the play is written so that ""you don't know you're entering the center of a storm until you're there."" Set in South Africa in 1950, the play is ""already a classic, though very contemporary and timely,"" said William Boswell, director of cultural events. ""It presents a compelling perspective not only on relations between races, but between adults and children and people in familial relationships."" The play's presentation coincides with the annual celebration of Black History Month. The playright, Athol Fugard, has spurred anger and resentment both inside and out of Africa and has occassionally been described as a spokesman for black South Africa. ""I have been told that as a white man, I cannot fully comprehend or appreciate what black reality is,"" said"

Cam pus cultural offerings expand,
with the Bucknell Opera Com pany,"By Lisa Spodak If you walked through the Langone Center during lunchtime last week, you may have heard something totally unexpected mixed in with the noon chatter--Opera. Well, those people sitting at the table with the video were members of the Bucknell Opera Company, and if you stopped to listen, you may have been surprised at what you heard. Todd Griffith, the acting manager of the company, told me that ""many people have misconceptions about opera."" They think that alloperas are heavy Italian undertakings that were written a hundred years ago. What they don ' t realize is that there are also many modem American operas and that a lot of them are funny. The Bucknell Opera Company ""strives to present a variety of styles of opera,"" according to Dr. Catherine Payn, director of the company. For example, Douglas M oore's Gallantry is standard soap opera material, complete with a hospital, doctors, a love triangle and commercials. Griffith also pointed out that many people who like musicals don't realize that they would probably also enjoy opera. Trouble in Tahiti, an American opera, was composed by Leonard Bernstein, the same man who composed the music for the popular Broadway show and movie West Side Story. It was in response to student interest that the Bucknell Opera Workshop was transformed into the Bucknell Opera Company. The company meets once a week and members receive a quarter credit for their efforts. Griffith was quick to add that anyone can join, not just music majors. ""Most people think you have to sound like an opera singer to join the company, but that's not so. It's a lot broader than people think,"" he said. ""Dr. Payn incorporates all different voice types and kinds."" The scenes which the company produces for its performances are not simply showcases for operatic singing. They are chosen for their dramatic content and character development, and members have the opportunity to act as well as sing. ""The Opera Company is a good experience for theaterpeoplebecause opera is as much a theater experience as it is a musical experience,"" Griffith said. When the company meets, Dr. Payn coaches them not on vocal production, but on characterization; she then meets individually with people to work on vocal production. The Bucknell Opera Company had its most recent performance last Saturday in Rooke Chapel. They performed five scenes from the American operas of four composers. The scenes were from Leonard Bernstein's Trouble in Tahiti, Aaron C opland's Tenderland, Gian-CarloMenotti's Amahl and the Night Visitors, and Douglas Moore's Gallantry and Ballad o f Baby Doe. The performance will be repeated Mar. 16 at 2:30 p.m. in Bucknell Hall. The Bucknell Opera Company's spring production will be a complete one act opera entitled The True Story of Cinderella, composed by Warren Martin. The May4 show will also consist of four scenes from Mozart operas, including the first work that the company will be doing that is not in English."
Gallery Series presents,

The Unseen Honesty Problem,"All faculty and administrators at Bucknell need to visit an optometrist! Too many are blind to the extent of academic dishonesty which occur at Bucknell. The time has come for Bucknell to enact a Honor Code to alleviate the problem caused by the current lax system. During the past semester, the number of academic dishonesty cases has increased to 67 cases which made their way to the Board of Review on Academic Responsibility. Numerous others never made it to the Board because they were handled by individual faculty members, and worse still, most violations are never even uncovered. Clearly 67 is a gross underreporting of the problem; the captain of the Titanic probably thought he was at fust encountering an ice cube rather than an enormous iceberg. The administration denies that academic dishonesty is an acute problem at Bucknell. Perhaps they really are that naive, or maybe they are trying to protect the reputation of the University. In either case, the status quo has clearly failed to provide an adequate deterrent to cheating. Most Bucknellians do indeed uphold the ideals of academic honesty, but a substantial minority does not. Students know that cheating pays off. The chancesof getting caught are minimal and the punishments often negligible. For these reasons, students often procrastinate and then find themselves plagiarizing, collaborating inappropriately, or cheating. Too many go unpunished. An honor code would reduce the instances of academic dishonesty in two important ways. It would, by necessity, educate students about the punishment associated with dishonesty. When students have to sign sworn statements after taking exams or writing an essay, they will at least be reminded that acts of dishonesty will be punished. Secondly, it would require that students report any cases of academic dishonesty of which they are aware Reporting will increase the chances of catching those who cheat, and the policy should go a long way to erase the ""snitch"" syndrome. It should be the duly of students to report cases of dishonesty to maintain the integrity of their own work. Some people argue that an honor code would make Bucknell a ""cut-throat"" school. If the administration were to draft a code which allowed a fair degree of collaboration while clearly defining the bounds of acceptable behavior, this would simply not be the case. An honor code can adequately stifle cheating while at the same time allowing for the free communication of ideas. Moreover, the success of honor codes at schools such as Haverford, Smith, and William & Mary is testimony to the deterrents created by such policies. It is time that the administration reconsidered instituting an honor code at Bucknell. In the meantime, the faculty should be reminded that every time they let students off easily, they are encouraging the continuation of this problem. If the University is really serious about giving students more responsibility, why not make them more responsible for their own actions?"

S.T.O.P. responds,
to readers' views,"To the Editor; Since January 16th and even before, political theorists and social analysts all over the world began their deliberations on determining the ""origins of the War in the Persian Gulf;"" yet one needs go no further than the Bucknellian editorial pages to pinpoint the exact dilemma in the United States today. Referring to Ms. LaMaire's letter to the editor, ""Faith helps overcome war worries,"" while each individual has the right to her or his own religious beliefs and perspectives, certainly the success of any republic would be in question if each of its citizens were content to sit back and watch as others decided their fates for them (which, assuredly, others would be willing todo). As for Mrs. Oltorik's letter to the editor entitled ""Parent urges Sojka to limi t acti vi ties of S .T.O J*.,"" S.T.O.P. recognizes that many share Mrs. Oltorik's view and would be glad to see the prohibition of S.T.OP. and its activities. But think of all the lives that were saved by the end of the Vietnam War that was brought about by the protest and opposition of that anti-war movement. Or the rights that women and people of color now enjoy because of the strength and force of the civil right movement. Clearly, the quality of life and protection of freedom that Mrs. Oltorik enjoys, as all of us enjoy, owes itself to the courage and strength of those who have raised their voice of dissent in the past For these reasons, S.T.OP. will continue its anti-war activities. And whereas some displays or activities may be seen as ""offensive"" to some, perhaps what is more ""offensive"" is the general acceptance and disinterest that many in our community seem to have as the lives of hundreds of Iraqis are wasted everyday. Citizens m ust question government and make it responsible for the potential consequences of its actions. S.T.O.P. formed with the initial goal of informing itself and the campus about the Persian Gulf War. We wanted to open dialogue and discussion about the questionable legitim acy and hypocrisy of fighting a war in the Gulf. After the careful research and discussion, S.T.O.P. is convinced that the government is inundating the American public with inaccurate ""facts"" and inform ation of questionable truth. S.T.O.P.'s activities have been numerous and controversial, but the objective was to oppose the war. The Bush Administration has rushed into this war too quickly; alternatives were not given the time needed to work. Basically, S.T.O.P. refuses to believe that the use of brute force is the only option: ""Why do we kill people who kill people to prove that killing people is wrong?"" Recently, President Sojka sponsored a ""Day of Reflection and Discussion."" Eight faculty members spoke on topics and considerations related to their areas of expertise. There were, at the most, thirty students there and at least half of them were S.T.O.P. members. How does the rest of the campus feel? Why is there so little interest in the See S.T.O.P., p. 10"
Events director urges public to,
accept programming diversity,"To the Editor: Soon after the performance by the British vocal group Electric Phoenix last Friday night at the Weis Center, a letter was hand-delivered to the Center. Although the author chose to remain anonymous, die unsigned letter raises important issues. I hope you will see fit to print excerpts and my responses contained herein. The letter states in part: ""Having great appreciation for Arts and Music, I must say that I've never before been subjected to such deranged 'entertainment'. Although the few people who were able to tolerate the performance would argue that it was an expression of man's artistic nature and a display of the range of human vocal capacity, the wide majority in attendance viewed it to be senseless noise and gibberish, and a waste of their time and money."" I find it gratifying that the author of this complaint had such a strong reaction: there are many who feel strongly that it is the duty of art to create in the observer/audience an emotional response; that too many are too complacent about art; that as a society we need more art that challenges, educates, uplifts, awakens, and, yes, even disgusts us. Art should make us feel and think, not lull us with the predictable and familiar. Life is not all happiness and comfort, and art, if it reflects or intensifies life, can likewise not all be beautiful. As a reaction to art, anger may not be pretty, and I suppose it can be dangerous if misdirected, but it's preferable to apathy. To neglect the opportunity of the Weis Center challenging its audience would reap the same consequence as Bucknell only booking uncontroversial speakers and lecturers: this would be a dull place and legitimately open to extreme criticism for neglecting its educational responsibilities. We are not in the business of defining or dictating taste, and I hope I made it clear before I was hired to my position that I have no interest in presenting to the lowest common denominator or scheduling only events which will appease and appeal to the largest possible audience. It is, however, exigent to offer opportunities for expansion of artistic horizons. For some this means exposure to the classics, for others it may mean introduction to what is current. What is paramountin making descisions about presentations on the Weis Center Series is quality, and Electric Phoenix is, to my my mind, unquestionably one of the best groups doing the kind of music they do. I am not at all sorry we presented them; I'm not sorry that some of the audience left at intermission; I am sorry that more people didn't give themselves the chance to have the experience and react. Let me go no further without saying that I, too, did not like someof the concert, though admittedly my reaction wasn't as strong. Still, I often prefer challenging, even maddening, musical experience to being pacified by concert performances of elevator music. Nobody says I have to like it, but I am a poorer person for having denied myself the chance to decide. I am often surprised by what I take away from unusual artistic adventures, especially if I can leave my preconceptions, and bad moods, at home. To more concretely respond to some of the letter's implied criticisms, let me note that there were those who enjoyed the performance. Electric Phoenix was on campus for a four- day residency in the Department of Music, and I am told it was a wonderful experience for the students lucky enough to work with them. It is"

My second reaction was to take it out of the recycle box and consider whether it was worthy of a important to me to coordinate as many as possible of the programs emanating from the Center with departments of the University, particularly the arts departments. 1 am pleased that we can offer masterclasses, residencies, and chances for our students to work with and appear on stage with recognized professionals.

Does ROTC belong at Bucknell?,
"The university should not recognize ""a training ground for killers.","* By George M. Jenks, collection development librarian The issue of ROTC has been with Bucknell and the nation for many years. ROTC was established by the National Defense Act of 1916 to provide officers for the Army. Why is it inappropriate for Bucknell to carry our the Army's objectives? First, there is the matter of discrimination. The Army discriminates on the basis of sexual orientation and gender. Bucknell's stated policy forbids this. ROTC cadets could find that after four years in ROTC, their commissions would be denied. Second, the University does not have the same control over the personnel of ROTC as it has over other programs. We let the Army appoint, evaluate and fire its personnel on out campus. Programs approved by Bucknell should support Bucknell's mission. The Army uses ROTC for its purposes, not Bucknell's. Third, and the most important reason is that the Army is a training ground for killers. This may sound like emotional rhetoric, but we must face reality. That's what armies do: kill and destroy. The tools used by the Army have only two purposes: death and destruction. They persuade in the gunslinger tradition of the Old West. National defense is the euphemism most often used to cloak the Army's actions. Of the many wars we have fought, few were defensive. We were attacked in the Second World War. The Mexican and Spanish-American wars were naked aggression on our part. Our incursions into other countries, form Mexico to Nicaragua to Haiti to Korea to Iraq and several countries in between, were to maintain our interests, not to defend ourselves. On the other hand, the University is a place of ideas, dedicated to discovery, discussion and debate, to the force of argument, not the forceof arms. Such an organization as ROTC, because of its peculiar way of imposing its will, has no place in a university. We should not serve as a military base. I hope that Bucknell's values do not include killing as a policy-making tool. Some say that, by training future officers at a university, rather than at the professional school at West Point, we can expose them to liberating and civilizing influences. This may be true (though unproven), but using this logic one can justify any program at Bucknell, the more reprehensible the better. Others say that ROTC scholarships enable students, particularly lower-income and minority, to attend Bucknell who might otherwise be unable to. It is not clear that this is true. Even if it were, this is a cynical view that says that the end justifies the means, and is institutional prostitution, a Faustian bargain of which we should be deeply ashamed. Someone said that my motion to sever our ties with ROTC was in bad taste because of the war in which we are engaged. I wonder if bombing Baghdad is in good taste?"
"""There is a  role for a  university such as ours in providing well",
"trained, ed u cated  an d  responsible officers...","* By Michael Chiaruttini '93 and Brian Selmeski '92 Since 1981, the Department of Defense has subscribed to a policy whereby homosexuals are prohibited from military service on the grounds of ""incompatibility,"" despite a lack of evidence to this end. ROTC has complied with this policy by only commissioning heterosexual men and women as Army officers. Homosexuals are clearly denied some of the benefits of the ROTC program. We consider this policy to be indefensible, and as Mr. Jenks points out, it is in direct conflict with Bucknell's non-discrimination clause. However, we do not believe that it is ground for severing university ties with ROTC. One reason is the high level governmental review of this policy currently being conducted by the General Accounting Office (GAO). It would be most unfortunate to end the mutually beneficial relationship between the Army and Bucknell, if in the near future this policy may be reversed. Those who believe that such an action would ""send a message to the Pentagon"" are sadly mistaken. This is not the first challenge to this policy. In fact, this type of discrimination has been upheld as legal in the Supreme Court. Furthurmore, the Department of Defense has made it clear that ROTC programs nation-wide will be scaled back considerably in the near future, as a result of shrinking defense expenditures. Losing the twelve to eighteen Lieutenants Bucknell ROTC commissions annually would mean very little in the big picture. The other basis Mr. Jenks gave for the severance of ties was that the ""mission of the armed forces is to kill other human beings and destroy property,"" which he sees as irreconcilable with the goals of Bucknell. We resent being characterized as such, and see this as an idealistic and narrow point of view. In his analysis, Mr. Jenks has confused the result of military action with the purpose of the military. It is important to understand that the armed forces do not define their own mission, rather they are an instrument of a civilian government who may utilize them in a number of different ways, of which war is but one. The idealist is lucky, not having to confront the ugly reality that war may indeed by necessary in certain circumstances. However, if we accept this premise, we see the obvious necessity of maintaining a military. Contrary to what many believe, there is a role for a university such as ours in providing well trained, educated and responsible officers, which are crucial to an effective and professional army. One need only refer to the University Mission Statement which states that Bucknell should emphasize ""the preparation of its students for the exercise of high responsibility in all phases of society."" We find it rather pretentious of Mr. Jenks to have decided for us, on the basis of his principles, that a liberal education should not include courses in Military Science. To insulate the university community from the military perspective provided by ROTC would be doing the students an injustice. We bear no malice towards Mr. Jenks personally, but we feel his idealistic approach fails to address many of the complex problems and realities surrounding this important issue. These opinions in no way represent the views of ROTC or the US Army."

J,"When I was four years old I had blocks. Everyone did, and they were fun. We would lovingly make boats, and houses with secret passages, and airplanes. They were the settings for countless creative action-figure adventures. Today four year olds have Nintendo. A convenient TV video- game system where kids can ""plug in"" a variety of adventures which all seem to entail guiding a muscular kung-fu barbarian through countless ""worlds"" until he single-handedly kills all the bad guys and rescues the beautiful princess. Usually he has three lives to do it. Individual games for this system cost about fifty bucks a pop and come with colorful manuals which graphically depict the bulging biceps of the warrior and the throbbing cleavage of the princess. Also, detailed stories are presented which set the unique scenario... Welcome to the dark world of ""Steel Barbarian."" Once upon a time there was a young Kung-Fu Master,Bladeftrm, who protectedthe land ofHarmonia where all the good people of the Universe livedin peace. But one day, when B ladefirm was out fighting evil, the dark wizard, Softdroop, and his tribe of Limpsies attacked Harmonia and kidnapped Voluptua, Bladefirm ' s faithful girlfriend and princess ofHarmonia. Now equipped only with his Phazer- Hammer and three sonic blasters, (which destroy all the enemies on screen with their high-pitched sound) Bladefirm must single-handedly mutilate all the Limpsies and dismember Softdroop in a one on one confrontation. Then Voluptua will come out and cling submissively to Bladefirm s pectorals as they both victoriously dance The Lambada. Nintendo has became a raging fad for kids of all ages, and I feel the negative effects of this vile machine on children are much worse than the punishment Justin and I got for accidently chucking a block through the kitchen window. I have worked as a swim counselor for a summer camp* for the past few years, and in that short time have noticed that the physically sedentary and mentally stifling conditions that Nintendo creates has caused at least three drastic changes in children's behavior. 1. Young children are no longer as willing to take risks. Perhaps in the dreamy video game world kids don't mind jumping across scorching flames or braving enemy gunfire, but in the real world of the camp swimming pool children seem increasingly reluctant to deal with non-video oriented obstacles. When I first began teaching swimming I remember ""The Tadpole"" group as adorable kindergartners who were delighted at the prospect of blowing bubbles or kicking with their hands on the wall. However, this past year when I enthusiastically urged the little tykes into the pool, they preferred to run around the deck like hyperactive mosquitos claiming that they were some guy named M ario who obviously didn't need swimming lessons. After about a week, I was tempted to lure the crazed vidiots into the bath-house where I would threaten to give them lethal doses of Riddylin unless they, at least, put their feet in the water. When the first six weeks of camp concluded, only a few of ""The Tadpoles"" had succeeded in getting their bathing suits even slightly damp. And that was just because they drank too much Bug- Juice for lunch. 2. Children are more violent. It seems that during ""free- swim"" kids are no longer able to play in a non-aggressive manner. Instead of pretending to be deep sea explorers or agile fish, the youngsters just sort of stand there, thinking of games that involve blasting and killing... Sammy: Boy this sucks! I wish I was home playing Super Mario Brothers XXV. Matthew: W ell... Ya wanna play Sharks and Minnows? Sammy: Why should I play thatdumbgame when I have""Deluxe Submarine Destroyer"" at home! Matthew: Well, lets make up a game then. Sammy: I know. We can pretend that we're Bladefirm and all the Swim Teachers are Limpsies... and we can use these kickboards here to mutilate them. Matthew: Yeah!!! Then we'll steal there whistles and blow them real loud in people's ears! Just a few short years ago these kids were placidly playing Marco- Polo, and now they are running around trying to decapitate lifeguards with flotation devices. Later that afternoon, Matthew told me that ""Steel Barbarian"" was a lot more fun at home because in HIS version of the game Limpsies didn ' t pull you out of the pool and call your parents when you attack them. 3. Children are less creative. It seems that kids never ""play act"" anymore. Many even lack the ability to keep themselves amused outdoors for more than a few minutes, unless, of course, there's a portable ""Nintendo Game-boy"" around. In Nintendo games, the task is simple and clear with the rules spelled out: If Mario touches a killer snail it will bite him and he will die. But now it seems that kids are incapable of playing games where they might have to use their imaginations to make up rulesoftheirown. Also.theNintendo system seems to capitalize on kiddie- trends by turning characters such as the Teenage Ninja Turtles and Bart Simpson into video game stars. Now kids can emulate their hero without using dolls tocreate their own creative stories and adventures, but merely by pressing buttons. In risk of sounding like H.G. W ells, Nintendo is becoming increasingly popular and I predict a dim future for our younger generations as they evolve into cowardly violent, boring people with no sense of imagination and overdeveloped thumbs. People who might be more inclined to look towards war with an ""evil"" enemy as a glorified solution to all problems, rather than attempting to create and explore. And build. Now we wouldn ' t want our children to be like that! Would we? Editor's Note: This column will appear every other week in this section of The Bucknellian."

Professor,"From page 8 which they have collected in support of their position. I am not naive enough to believe that professors have not in the past, and will not continue in the future, to abuse their position by using their classroom as a forum in which to advance their own political, moral and religious positions. I am sure all of us have at one time or another sat through such sessions and felt repulsed, angered and cheated. I feel quite strongly that the classroom is a forum for the dissemination of material germane to the subject at hand. 1 do not feel I have the right (no matter how strongly 1 may feel) to abuse my students and the power entrusted to me by trumpeting personal and political issues. I am not advocating that political issues are inappropriate to discuss in political science classes or that it is inappropriate to discuss the environmental impact of the war in Geology classes. In some classes I would hope that the Persian/Arabian Gulf issues are thoroughly discussed from all angles and viewpoints. They arc clearly appropriate topics in some classes when discussed in the appropriate light. My concern is that the membersof S.T.O.P. (both faculty and student alike) seem incapable (or unwilling) to make any distinctions between what is and is not appropriate in the classroom. That they have no difficulty with the first meetings of my mathematics classes being spent in these discussions says a lot about their judgment. Not only is this an inappropriate use of the classroom from the point of view of one perspective, but it is quite likely that an activediscussion of topicsevoking strong opinions and emotions will polarize groups within the class. Undoubtedly some of these group will be alienated against the faculty member. In any event such behavior would affect the range of options available in teaching the class. Were I a student or parent, I would lodge complaints at the highest levels and stronglyconsideratransfer to another class. No one has said that S.T.O.P. docs not have the right to express its views in public forums or meetings. Nor am I asserti ng that current events and diverse political views are not to be disc ussed in appropriate classroom settings. There is a line, however, where the appropriate becomes inappropriate, and I think most would agree that in this case that line has clearly been crossed. With power and freedom there also goes a degree of responsibility and restraint. If responsibility and restraint are not exercised, then the rights and freedoms of all are endangered. It is my feeling that this group has perverted the nature of academic freedom and free speech to a point where it puts these principles at risk. I am further outraged by the fact that Ernie Keen is the chair of the University Review Committee. Is this an example of what he believes makes a good teacher? How does he react to those of us who do not share his views on how we should conduct our classes? If this is an example of his good judgment, then what can we expect in a difficult review case? Were I a faculty member coming up for review, I would be writing this letter with trepidation. No matter how may verbal assurances are offered of his objectivity, this lack of it in the classroom speaks far louder than words. Ernie Keen's position will not and has not gone unnoticed by the junior faculty. In the past many students have reacted with incredulity and surprise that political issues and stands on University policies not in line with the current powers to be (whether in the faculty or administration)can putjunior faculty at risk. Examples such as this serve only to destroy what little faith is left. Does the rest of the committee share his views on teaching? Paul McGuire Asst.

And an audience truly ""sickened to the core"" would not have laughed so heartily at the humorous juxtapositions in the John Cage work.

ART,
The right choice.,"diverse artistic sensibilities on this campus or anywhere else. My sincere hope for the author of the letter, and for all with similar reactions (be they students or not), is that you will continue to risk experiencing art you may not like but might leant from; will cultivate your intellectual curiosity; will fight for the moral right of artists and all others to express themselves in any way, no matter that some may be offended or worse. Whoever you are, you have nothing to be ashamed of in writing your letter. Had you signed your name I could identify you as I applaud your concern and attempt to dissuade you from too narrow a view of what is good or what it art. When you try a new flavor of ice cream and don'tlike it, do you never try another, demand your money back, or expect the company to cease making it? You can and should continue to experiment, and to vote with your dollars, with your letters, and, as they say, with your feet From scant evidence, I daresay you are an intelligent, active student of the kind who make Bucknell exciting for me and others on the faculty and staff; I imagine that as a graduate you will be an example of the best of what Bucknell is about. Please continue to attend events of all kinds, comfortable and weird, known and new, obvious and odd. Promise me that and I'll promise to try to provide varied and interesting programming.

S.T.O.P-,"From page 8 Gulf issue? How is it possible that a million women and men in Saudi Arabia stand ready to sacrifice their lives while not even one hundred Bucknellians are willing to sacrifice their Sunday afternoons? In political theory we learn that the framers of the Constitution held strong to the belief that the history and policies of a nation could be determined by the people. The notion of a predetermined fate was leftbehind when humankind entered the Age of Reason and Enlightenment. As citizens we have the obligation and duty to educate ourselves and make our voices heard. With rights come responsibility. At the very least we have the responsibility to get involved and stay involved with the War in the Gulf. We owe it not only to the women and men fighting this war, but also to ourselves."

Let's Do Lunch,"By Julie Bachman and Steve Hoerter Staff Writers Lickety Split Ice Cream Parlor and Cafe 328 Market Street Lewisburg 524-0115 Open weekdays 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. t weekends til 9 p.m. It is common knowledge that Lickety Splitisoneof the best places for ice cream and frozen yogurt in Lewisburg. But, as Julie and Steve found out this week, Lickety Split is also a nifty place to do lunch. Croissant sandwiches, quiches, soups, salads, bagels and homemade cookies highlight a menu perfect for satisfying even the most finicky appetite. Excellent service and a relaxed atmosphere complement the varied lunch menu. Julie dined on a cup of minestrone soup ($1.25) and a slice of broccoli and cheese quiche ($2.50). The soup was hearty, spicy and refreshing on a cold winter's day. The quiche was delicious- light, yet extremely satisfying. For dessert, Julie had a swirl of Old World Chocolate and Tropical Banana frozen yogurt wi th chocolate chip sprinkles ($1.15) What a treat! Steve sampled a cup of the Bowtie Chicken Soup ($1.25) and a turkey and swiss cheese croissant sandwich ($3.25). The soup was flavorful, and contained healthy chunks of chicken and tasty pasta. The croissant sandwich, served hot, was simply delicious- an excellent choice for any lunch stop at Lickety Split. Steve, lacking any sense of adventurism, also tried a swirl of OldWorldChocolateandT ropical Banana frozen yogurt ($1.15) The yogurt, as always, was fantastic. Julie and Steve highly recommend Lickety Split for lunch or any other occasion. Check it out!"
Bison Tales,"By Marc Haimes Staff Writer So the question remains: How can we obtain convenient access to a variety of condoms without having to face the humiliation of buying them at the Convenience Store? And the answer is...CONDOM VENDORS!!! That's right. These entrepreneurs can order their diverse selection of condoms in bulk and then sell for maximum profit. The operation would be simple. When couples enter a room with the intention of eventual sexual activity, they could place money (bills or change) in a special ""Condom Vendor Request Envelope"" TM which they would leave outside the door. On the front of the envelope, they would specify the following information: 1. Number of condoms needed. 2. Type of condoms desired. 3. Approximate time of fornication. As the Condom Vendors make their rounds, he or she would collect these envelopes. Then, at the desired time, the vendor would return to the room, perform the special ""Condom Vendor Knock"" (Shave and a Haircut), and slip the correct number of condoms under the door. For those of you who are a bit more spontaneous in your bedroom activities, do not fret; just keep your ears open. As the Condom Vendor strolls the halls he or she will perform the following ""Condom Vendor Jingle: - sing to the tune of ""Piano Man"" by Billy Joel Oh, I'll help you stay protected I'm the Condom Man ___ Yes I' 11 give you some rubbers for cash. Oh were all in the mood for some romance. But if you're not careful, you could develop a rash. (Harmonica Solo) Copyright 1991 Now keep in mind that this wouldonlybethechorus. Theverses could go into greater detail as to the benefits of ribbing and lubrication. What's that you say?!? This idea is ridiculous?!?

Collegiate Perspective,"By Peter Lalos Staff Writer After months of intensive undercover investigation, ""The Collegiate Perspective"" will this week explore the currcntcondi tion of the historically controversial independent system of Bucknell University. This often volatile coalition, whose mere presence on campus has been steadfastly denounced by members of the university's faculty as of late, has even more recently come under fire due to allegations of elitism, sexism, anti-intellectualism, and excessive individualism within their ranks. Events in this situation came to a rather ugly head last week when a member of a campus fraternity attempted to be deactivated from his organization, only to be denied admittance into the independent system by an overwhelming vote from independent brothers and sisters. The dispute is to come before a university hearing committee in early March. Even before the fallout over the independent system's latest abuses of power, there were cries from independents that their entire system was being made the target of a seek-and-destroy mission by members of Bucknell's faculty, adm inistration, and Mary Macintosh service; indeed, it is swiftly becoming apparent that an anti-independent movement is rapidly gaining momentum on campuses across the nation. Tomorrow evening, the Inter- Independent Council plans to hold a public forum in the Vaughan Literature auditorium in the hopes of creating appropriate channels of dialogue for... aw, poop. This is no way to run a column. Results of Student Requalification Exam, Fall Semester, Bucknell University (see Dec. 7 column): - 74% achieved passing grade - 11% failed to achieve passing grade (readmittance denied) 8% could not find registrar's office to turn in exam - 4% sat down in the street and began singing ""Give Peace a Chance"" - 3% never made it past Question # 5, asking, ""Who the heck is Nolan Johannes?"" ' A f t e r t h o u g h t s department: Clinical studies have uncovered that, as a rule, the university's ""Cash for Books"" policy dictates that a student will receive a percentage of his/her textbooks' original cost proportional to the amount of information which he/she can still remember from them after exams are over... namely, about 0%- 25%. *l've had an interesting problem in my dorm this winter; maybe those of you who inhabit the more ancient buildings on campus can identify with me. It goes like this: the heating system in my dorm operates in such a fashion that rooms on one side of the hallway are fired up to an almost unimaginable heat, while the rooms on the other side of the hall receive relatively little heat by comparison and thus remain markedly colder, both sides have been like this for as long as I can remember. Although it is a mystery to most men of science, thermal physicists have at least lent it an appellation: 'The Me DLT Syndrome."" *Bo knows your MAC number. ' After taking an exam, why is it that when you check with a friend about a test response in order to salve your fears about answering it incorrectly, he/she always happened to put down an answer different from yours, thus making both of you nervous? Where docs the law of averages figure into that? Maybe M urphy's Law is more applicable. *""New... potatoes""? What the... * Is it me, or do the sponsors of all comedians appearing at Bucknell try to get the person in their organization who is the most uncomfortable in front of a crowd to introduce the stand-up comics? *How privileged is Buckncll's student body? We don't use Xerox machines to make copies-- we use Laser printers. Now that's classy. Next week: Holds no interest for me. This column runs very other week. _____________"

Multiculture Center traces roots,"By Shirln Kambin Question: What office is located on the second floor of Roberts Hall in rooms 200 E and F? Answer: This is the location of the Multiculture Center, which was established in the fall of 1986. The center is, according to the 1991 Student Handbook ""intended to be a focal point for learning about and developing an appreciation of the arts, beliefs, customs and institutions of other cultures, especially those comprising the heritage of black, Hispanic, and Native American students and those of Bucknell's international students."" While the Multiculture Center has expanded over the past five years, its creation was sparked by a student ""talk-in"" in the spring of 1985. On Friday afternoon of Spring W eekend '85, a group of predominantly black students and several faculty members gathered on the terrace in front of the Bison snack bar to tell of their experiences at Bucknell, and what Dean of Students John Dunlop described in his 1986 report to be a perceived lack of concern about the ""welfare and education of black students."" The meeting was considered to be an emotional one in which the rhetoric was not only com pelling but provocative as well. Following the ""talk-in,"" the group presented a list of goals they hoped to achieve, one goal being an expansion of the support system already in existence. At that time, Judy Jackson was employed part-time to serve the needs of both foreign and A frican-Am erican students. While she was a strong voice of support as well as an assertive woman, the university needed more. In other words, the students needed to have a place they could go where their concerns and interests would be addressed. Instrum ental in the establishment of the Multiculture Center was Vemese Edghill '87, a Dana Scholar, assigned to the Office of the Vice President for Plannning and Administration. In the summer of 1985, she traveled to several campuses investigating how other institutions addressed the needs of minority students. What she came to discover was that many schools had ""cultural centers"" where black students and others could turn. Upon returning to Bucknell in the fall, she compiled a report of her findings and sent copies to the members of the President's staff and other appropriate individuals on campus. After a series of administrative m eetings, the students again expressed the strong desire to have a cultural center. As a result, they presented a petition and letters of support to President Sojka calling for the establishm ent of a Multiculture Center here at B ucknell. Mr. Sojka agreed that there was genuine interest and support for such a center and soon thereafter, in October 1986, the Multiculture Center opened under the leadership of Rebekah Mitchell. The center currently serves as the core for such groups as the Bucknell International Organization, The Pakistan-India Association, the African-American Cultural Society,"

This year, the Multiculture Center is administered by Tim Clark, D irector of M inority Student Development, and Adrienne Jones, Director of Multicultural Programs. Mr. Clark's primary responsibilities include assisting students in making a successful _ _ _ _ _ _ _ transition to the B u c k n e l l campus, as well as providing support services designed to e n h a n c e ---- -- -- a c a d e m i c perform ance, promote personal development, and stimulate creative social involvement in campus living. Ms. Jones' responsibilities, on the other hand, include assessing the need for various programs on campus, and then making these programs a reality. Programming includes bringing such personalities as poet b.f. maiz, civil rights commissioner Dr. Mary Frances Berry, and speaker Lonise Bias to campus. Jones also represents the force behind the plan ni ng of K wanzaa celebrations and programs for Black History Month. Certainly no one office on campus can achieve goals on its own- the support of other students and the institution as a whole is needed. As a result, the Multiculture Center, while making great strides, can serve solely as a catalyst on campus. It can attempt to both support and educate, but simultaneously, each and every element of Bucknell has to be open and responsive to cultural diversity before Bucknell can truly be considered multicultural."

Track heads to conference finals,"By Chris Drowne Staff Writter Today and tomorrow Bucknell will try to bring home the inaugural Patriot League indoor track and field championship, but both the men's and women's teams will have to turn in strong performances to emerge from a talented field at Colgate University. On paper, each of head coach Art Gulden's squads has posted top times in eight of the 16 events. However, Fordham has also boasted some impressive results and should provide each squad with stiff competition. All runners should benefit from Colgate's track, which Matt Deardorff '92 calls, ""an excellen t running surface."" The men's team, which won nine straight East Coast Conference indoor championships before changing leagues this year, will have to call on its dominant distance runners for the bulk of its points. Norbert Berenyi '91, Jeff Loomis '92, and Deardorff, who all helped Bucknell to a Patriot League Cross Country title in the fall, have dominated these events all winter and should provide those points. men expect to ao well include the 55 meter hurdles and dash, along with the weight and shot put Jim Bock '92 and Matt Barolo '93 have posted impressive marks in these two events. Bock is also expected to do well in the 200 meter. When it comes to the 35-pound weight and shot pul, Paul Austin '91 has no peer. No Patriot League thrower has come within two feet of Austin in either event. Like the men, the Lady Bison will look to the sprints and hurdles for important points. Karen Shimomura '91 has yet to be challenged by any non-Bucknell runner this winter. Lynette McBride '91, who is undefeated in the long jump this winter, and Tricia Plasko '92 are expected to score in the 55- and 200-meter dashes. The 4x400 meter relay team, along with jumpers McBride, Lynda Rose '91, Jenny Thomas '94, Dawn Ellery '94, Jen James '93, and Ella Episcopo '92 all need to contribute if the Lady Bison are to win. Both teams dominated last weekend's non-scoring home meet against Lock Haven, Bloomsburg, and Susquehanna, winning 21 of the events. Michael Klemen/The Bucknellian Kris DeardorfT '93 leads the way in the 880-yard run as numerous Lock Haven women follow. The Lady Bison took first place in ten events, including the above race."
Tom Marchetti '91,Tom Marchetti '91 is honored as Athlete of the Week for becoming the first wrestler in Bucknell history to record over 100 wins in a career. The Easton native got his milestone victory by pinning Delaware's Chris Wagner in the third period last Friday night. His season record now stands at 26-4 with 16 pins. Marchetti is also Bucknell's all-time pins leader with 38. The East Coast W restling Association recognized these accomplishments in naming him its Wrestler of the Week.

"Ice hockey hits the skids,",
seven skaters for last two,"By Jennifer Walsh Staff Writer Playing against a tenacious bunch of skaters from Loyola University of Maryland, the Bucknell ice hockey team racked up its seventh victory of the season last Friday in a game that started out as a romp and ended in a squeaker. After jumping out to a huge 7- 0 lead in the first two periods, Bucknell allowed Loyola to come back to within two goals of a tie, just holding their opponents off the scoreboard long enough to hang on for a crucial 7-5 victory. The win boosted Bucknell's record to 7-4, good enough to keep the ream in close running for a spot in the upcoming Mason-Dixon Leauge playoffs. Playing their last home game of the season, the Bison got off to a flying start on the scoreboard as well as on the ice. Right from the drop of the puck, Bucknell set the tone of the game with rapid skating and agressi ve forechecking that quickly punctured the Loyola defense. The Bison's first goal of the game came off the stick of Jamie Abrahamson '93 at 6:04 of the first period, when a Bucknell shot from the point found its way to the net through a haze of players. Loyola goal tender Justin Kistelac managed to make the initial save, but could not control the rebound before Abrahamson had put the puck away for his first of what was to be a three- goal night, lifting Bucknell to a 1-0 lead. With the exception of a two- on-one play that almost resulted in a short-handed goal for Loyola, the Bison completely shut down all of the opposition's offense for the entire period. Loyola had a mere six shots on goal while the Bison managed twice as many of their own at the other end of the ice. ""We were really pleased with first and second periods--that was probably the best we've played all year long, both offensively and defensively--but we kind of let up in the third,"" said Bucknell co-captain John Guelcher '91. Not only did Bucknell let up in the third period against Loyola, they just about let go. The tight defense and aggressive offense virtually disappeared during that final segment, gone with the icy wind that so inhospitably gusted across the outdoor rink, just about carrying the puck off with it and freezing to death the few brave souls who remained to watch the disappointing third period. Actually, the down-hill slide for the Bison began in the very late stages of the second period, when they allowed Loyola to score the goal which broke the shutout with only four seconds remaining on the clock. At the time, this seemed to hold little concern for Bucknell, who still had a nice six-goal cushion to ride on going into the third. However, to the credit of the Loyola players, they did not fold as perhaps the Bison had expected them to in the last period. Instead, they took advantage of Bucknell's slacking off and cashed in on four more goals to pull within two of a tie. Loyola even pulled their goaltender in order to put an extra skater on the ice for the last few minutes of play in hopes that the extra man would help them score. Luckily for Bucknell, the clock ran down faster than the goals could add up for Loyola, and the Bison managed to hold on for the win 7-5. Sometimes you hang on for a win, sometimes you lose a close one, and sometimes you just wish you hadn't even bothered to show up especially when more than half of your teammates decided not to. The latter was the disheartening case for Bucknell in a game against Johns Hopkins University this past Monday, where the Bison were shelled by their opponents, losing 12-2 to a team that co-captain Carl Zuckerberg '91 said ""we could've easily beaten with a full team."" Bucknell's depleted ranks left them with only seven skaters as opposed to Johns Hopkins' twenty, notonlyenoughfortwofulllines. To make matters worse, only one skater from Bucknell's top three lines showed up for the game. Hopkins, a fast and physical team, wasted no time in taking advantage of the situation. ""We played pretty good for the first five or ten minutes of the game, but after that, there was just no way,"" said defenseman Guelcher'91. ""They pretty much had their way with us."" The game turned completely disastrous for Bucknell as the Bison were forced to play exhausting five- minute shifts out on the ice with very little time to rest in between. Under the circumstances, it was quite incredible that Bucknell scored at all, even more so that both goals came in the third period. By that time, the Bison must have felt like they were skating on legs made of lead, but they still managed to get the puck in the net, one goal coming from Mike McClean '92 on a rebound, the other on a surprising shot taken by Guelc her from inside the Bucknell blue line that travelled at least 70 feet before finding the net behind a stunned Johns Hopkins goaltender. Unfortunately for Bucknell, the next game provided no help in the wins column, as the Bison dropped their second in a row, this time in a heartbreaking 3-2 loss to Gettysburg on Wednesday night. Again left with only seven skaters on the team, Bucknell played perhaps its grittiest game of the season in a valiant effort to salvage a much- needed victory, despite their horrendous lack of manpower. The Bison matched Gettysburg stride for stride throughout the first two periods, battling to keep the score even at two on pretty goals from Guelcher and John Werring '93. Werring scored after making a nice play at center ice to strip Gettysburg of the puck and break in on the opposing goaltender, where he was then able to stash it in for his first goal of the season. Guelcher, a good puck-carrying defenseman, deomonstrated his offensive abilities as he took the puck end-to-end on a solo rush that resulted in Bucknell's other goal of the night. But in spite of both the marvelous individual and team efforts, Bucknell eventually fell to Gettysburg after"
just,
games,"allowing the game-winning goal in the third period. Teammate Zuckerberg pointed to Bucknell goalie Alec Altman '94 as one of the reason for the closeness of the game, saying that Altman had played ""a very good game."" Altman himself commented, ""I think I played well--I was satisfied. They didn ' t get any easy goals on me, and I made the saves I needed to. The guys that did go [to Gettysburg] just played a really great game. Everybody gave at least 200percent. "" But as for the guys that didn't go, their dedicated teammates were highly critical. ""It just seems like some guys have better things to do than play hockey,"" remarked Guelcher, alluding to the fact that, while some of the Bucknell players were truly unable to make the last two games, a vast majority were simply making up flimsy excuses to get out of playing. This, of course, is a practice unpopular with any sports team, let alone a team playing a game taking as much hard work and dedication as ice hockey.

Hockey,"with a new-found confidence. The team will be looking to put their success on the line this weekend in two tough matches against Central Connecticut and Hofstra. Central Connecticut, according to Ferraro, is a ""strong, well-balanced team which gets national exposure. They have had 4 or 5 guys at the national championships in the past We are capable of beating them, but we will have to wrestle well."" Ferraro is confident that Hofstra can be beaten as well, ""depending on how well we match up. They have no balance on the team, and should be easier to handle."" f ""Takedowns' N\ Mike Van Daren '92 has won eightof his last nine decisions...Ken Herceg '92 is only one pin away from moving into second place on the Bucknell All-Time pins list..Five of the grappler's eight losses have come at the hands of nationally ranked opponents From page 13 team's chance of making the playoffs at the end of the season. The Bison must now wait and hope for the right teams to win and lose if they are to gain a berth in the competi tion for the championship, and chances appear to be slim. But perhaps the most ironic part of the situation is that Bucknell, if it makes the playoffs, would have a very good shot at the championship. That is, providing that enough of the team shows up for the games. Peter Ho /The Bucknellian Russ Parker '93 pins his Delaware opponent during Bucknell's victory last Friday night."

Wrestling,"From page 16 Doren, Ken Herceg '92, Marchetti, Bums and Meyers. One of the key points of the match occurred when Van Doren pinned Drexel's Dan Hrothka, ranked seventh in the nation in the 142 lb. weight class. Hrothka had been moved up to 150 lbs. for his match in anticipation of the Drexel second team wrestler defeating Elliot. This, however, did not happen, and Drexel's strategic maneuver failed. Coach Ferraro was pleased with the team's effort over the weekend. ""The team is coming on at the right time,"" he said. ""We had two very excellent matches."" The turnaround comes on the heels of the challenging trip to California in January where the team was on the receiving end of some difficult defeats. There was some speculation that the severity of the defeats could possibly demoralize the team. Ferraro lends no credibility to that theory, and, in fact, says the truth lies in the other extreme. ""The reason for our success at this point in the season is because of the competitive non-conference schedule. We are better prepared as a whole."" He feels this philosophy will spill over into the NCAA tournament- ""Barring injuries, we will be better prepared than the competition"" While the grappiers enjoyed their success over the weekend, the big story was Tom Marchetti's 100th career victory. The next closest man has eighty-nine wins, indicative of the greatness of his achievement. As Ferraro noted, 'T o win 100 is to really distinguish yourself. It's a great feat."" In Marchetti's four years in Lewisburg. the wrestler has become one of the dominant forces in the country in his weight class, and the achievement puts the finishing touches on an excellent career. After the victory, the distinction was announced over the speakers and was followed by an extended standing ovation. Later, a reception was held for the senior. As co-captain Bums said of his peer, ""After Tom achieved All-American status sophomore year, he became the first person at Bucknell to do so, the University did nothing to acknowledge his feat. It was nice to see him receive some gratification for his efforts and achievements. He deserves the attention."" The B ison grappiers are com mg off a successful weekend of wrestling Peter Ho/TheBuckneHian Heather Ross '94 puts up a shot against Canisius earlier this season."

Bison to face Lehigh after 1 -1 week,"By Kirk Peters Staff Writer On Saturday night, Bucknell's men's basketball team will renew its long-standing rivalry with Lehigh University. Once again, a team will travel to Lewisburg from Bethlehem and no one will know whether to call them the Brown and White or the Engineers. Once again, two bus loads of Lehigh fans will make the trip to Davis Gym (Get there around 6:30 so that our dear friends from Steclland won't have anywhere to sit). The event itself will be as physical and intense as always. The only factor left to chance is the outcome. Forward Pat King '92 says there is ""definitely"" a score to settle with Lehigh. The Engineers (after hours of exhausting research 1 have determined that to be their official nickname) have won the last four meetings with the Bison. The streak includes a victory in the semi-finals of last year's East Coast Conference Tournament and one on January 30 in Bethlehem. In the encounter earlier this season, the Breakin' Bison stampeded to a 45-32 half-time lead. However, Lehigh stormed back by shooting 62 percent from the field in the second half. The Engineers were led by Dozie (buy a vowel) Mbonu with 18 and Bob Krizansky with 16. The Bison got 22 from Bill Courtney '92 and 20 from King, but shot only 35.5 percent in the second half. The Engineers are consistently led by the front line of Mbonu, Krizansky, and Jay Hipps. Senior Mike O'Hara provides a three-point threat for Lehigh. The Bison need to play solid interior defense and control the boards to beat the Engineers. The Bison should take an emotional advantage into the game from the pre-game senior recognition ceremonies. Keith Fenton, Steve Leshinski, Mike D iver, Malik Malone, and Rob Joy will be honored. A win by the Bison would mean more than just a nice finale and bragging rights for the seniors, it would also give them a chance to finish in third place in the Patriot League. Several tie-breakers are involved, but if the Bison could beat Lehigh and then Lafayette, they would have a legitimate shot at the third seed in the upcoming Patriot League Tournament. The Bison enter tomorrow night's game coming off a hard- fought victory at Colgate on Wednesday night. The Bison erased a five-point second-half deficit en route to a 70-67 victory. The win insured the Bison their ninth straight winning season under head coach Charlie Woollum. After the game, Woollum expressed his relief to be leaving Hamilton with a win. 'The kids played really well in the last five minutes. We're happy about it We just want to get home now."" Trailing 42-37 early in the second half, the Bison went on a 15- 4 run to take the lead for good. Courtney, who led the Bison with 19 points for the game, had nine points in that stretch. Courtney was 8 for 10 from the charity stripe including some clutch bucketsdownthestretch. Good defense in the Red Raiders final two possessions sealed the game for the Breakin' Bison. With Bucknell up by two with 25 seconds left, Leshinski forced a three second violation with solid defense in the paint. Then, after Courtney hit one free throw, Fenton stole the ball from Jay Armstrong as he was going up for a three pointer that could have tied the game and sent it to overtime. King also had a strong game with 15 points, 10 in the second half, and 9 rebounds. Mike Bright'93 and Paul Olkowski '93 with 14 and 8 respectively, joined King to give the Bison the front court scoring they needed to win. The results from last Saturday's encounter with Fordham were not as rewarding for Bucknell. A scrappy Bison team cut a 12 point second- half deficit to 2 before finally falling to the powerful Rams 69-63. Bright and King led the Bison with 20 and 18 points respectively. The Bison held Damon Lopez to ten points, but were burned by the outside shooting of Dave Buckner, who finished with 16. Peter Ho/File Photo Patrick King '92 and Mike Bright '93 controll the rebound during a game earlier this season against Yale. The two have dominated the boards, ranking fourth and fifth in the League, respectively. Men's ""Tip-Ins"" ' Tomorrow at 1:00 p.m,, Alumni of Bucknell Basketball will play their annual game.

Women s hoops,
drops two more,"By Todd Bianchine and Dave Riggs Staff Writers The women's basketball team dropped two more games in Patriot League play last week, bringing their overall record to 2-21 with a 1-9 conference record. The losses put the Lady Bison in last place in the league; Lehigh was able to come up with a victory over Lafayette to get out of the cellar. Bucknell will square off against Lehigh tomorrow at 5:15 in Davis Gym for the last home game of the regular season. B ucknel 1 took on Fordham last Saturday, hoping to come up with a big upset over the second place team, but a dry stretch in the second half ended up costing the Lady Bison the game,84-72. The firsttwenty minutes of the game were evenly played between the two squads; the biggest lead held during the half was four points by the Lady Rams. Bucknell went into the locker room down by two and with high hopes of pulling off the upset. ""We just went back and forth in the first half,"" said coach Lori Howard. ""Nobody was able to pull away from each other and we knew we had a shot at winning the game."" The second half started out much the same as the first, with the two teams taking turns leading the ball game. After a Joy Sandler '92 freethrow with 8:23 left to play brought the Lady Bison within four points, the Lady Rams took off, scoring the next nine points to make the score 71-58 with 5:11 left to play. Kelly Dee '94 broke the scoring drought by nailing a three-pointer but it proved to be a little too late as Fordham cruised the rest of the way to take the game 84- 72. ""That scoring drought really killed us,"" said Howard, ""we just couldn't put the ball in the hoop, it was like there was a lid on it or something. If it weren't for that lapse it would have gone down to the wire."" On Wednesday Bucknell took on third place Colgate in Hamilton, N.Y. The Lady Red Raiders were definitely up to the challenge as they jumped all over the Lady Bison early and wenton to a96-82 victory. Colgate ran up a 12-2 lead in the first five minutes, forcing Bucknell to use a timeout, and then they scored 10 more points to make it 22-2 with 12:34 left before Bucknell used another timeout Colgate held the 20-point margin at the end of the half by a score of 52-32. ""We just never got off the bus,"" Howard commented, ""we were just slow and were not play ing really well."" Bucknell played much better in the second half, outscoring Colgate 50-44 in the final 20 minutes. Dec ended up with a game-- and career-- high 25 points, including 3 three- pointers. Julie Bachman GR netted See WOMEN'S HOOPS, page 15 By Jamie Diaferia Staff Writer The B ison grapplers capped off a successful weekend by defeating Delaware on Friday and Drexel on Saturday. The victories give Bucknell a record of 6-8, though coach Bob Ferraro noted that the team is wrestling better than it has all year. The weekend was also highlighted bySeniorTomMarchetti's '91100th and 101st career victories, making him the first person in Bucknell history to break the 100 win barrier. The Bison headed into the Delaware match coming off a string of tough competitions in California over the past month and a half. The losses left Bucknell with a record of 4-8, numbers that, according to Ferraro, are hardly indicative of the truecaliberoftheteam. Thegrapplers proved this by soundly defeating Delaware 49-3 in a meet that included six victories by fall. Wins were recorded by Russ Parker '93 (112 lbs.), John Walizer '91 (126 lbs.), Tim Mead '91 (142 lbs.), Mike Van Doren '92 (150 lbs.), Mike Salone '92 (158 lbs.), Tom Marchetti (168 lbs.), Chris Harvey '91 (177 lbs.), Bryan Bums '91 (190 lbs.), and Ben Myers '92 (heavyweight). The trouncing of Delaware apparently set the tone for Saturday's matchupagainsta tough Drexel team, in which the Bison won 33-13. The match featured wins by Phil Elliot '93, Walizer, Chris Ducas '91, Van See WRESTLING 'atm Captain Bryan Burns 91 pins his Delaware opponant in the 190 lbs. weight class match-up of last Friday'] Peter Ho/The Bucknellian s 49-3 victory."

1 seed Fordham In tourney semis,"By Andrew Cohen StaffWriter A ""Bring Your Own Booze"" (BYOB) policy will be in effect at Bucknell as early as next semester, according to Denis Maguire '93, president of the Inter-fraternity Council. ""It comes right down to li ability. Each national fraternity is a corporation that needs to be insured. The direction which lawsuits are going means that all fraternities are becoming liable for all guests,"" said Maguire. Ed Dadez, associate dean of residential life, explained that the push to BYOB is a result of the risk management policy of Fraternity Insurance Purchasing Group (FTPG) and pressure from nationals. Eleven of the twelve fraternities in IFC are under FIPG or similar risk manage ment policies, said Dadez. The FIPG risk management policy man dates: ""No alcoholic beverages may be purchased through the chapter treasury nor may the purchase of same for members or guests be un dertaken or coordinated by any member in the name of or on behalf of the chapter. The purchase and/or use of a bulk quantity of such alco holic beverage, i.e., kegs, is prohib ited."" Dadez explained that if frater nities violate this policy, although they will be covered, they will most likely be sued by their insurance company if a claim is made. There fore, nationals are exerting a great amount of pressure because they ""are very serious about limiting their liability in alcohol situations."" Maguire noted that ""some houses are getting more pressure than others,"" and that ""nationals are being patient"" for a time.

future of Bucknell ROTC,
University declines to take,
position on incinerator issue,
Sojka encourages campus-wide discussion,"By Bob Ritter StaffWriter Following the recommenda tion of the University Council, President Gary Sojka has decided that the University should not take a policy position on the construction of a hazardous waste incinerator in Gregg Township, in northern Union County. Sojka, however, did make it clear that other organized units of the University are free to articulate a po sition on the controversial project. While Sojka has publicly ad mitted ""real serious personal con cerns"" about the impact of the pro posed project, he believes the critical issue at stake is not the incinerator itself, but whether ""Bucknell should have a stance, and who should make the decision what it is."" Defining the question as ""a matter of figuring out how to proceed,"" Sojka highlighted the University's inclination ""for procedure, and protecting the rights of the individual"" in his emphasis that ""any of the entities"" on campus, such as the faculty, the students or the support staff who wish to take a stand ""should feel free to do so."" Sojka admitted that he ""would wel come discussion on the floor of the faculty, and I would participate in that discussion as part of the fac ulty."" Explaining the complexity of choosing a broad position for the University, Sojka asked, ""What does it mean if you [as an employee] feel different,"" since the University has no overall structure to determine the opinions of the community's mem bers. As an example, Sojka ex plained that, in a faculty vote, dis senting votes are still recorded, while the University does not have such a vehicle available to it. Sojka also questioned the ef fect of a University decision on the issue, questioning whether there is ""more or less impact if Bucknell does it"" than if several groups take independent stands against the project. He also expressed con cerned about the impact on future issues, saying, ""If you start a prece dent, its worrisome."" Charles Sackrey, associate professor of economics and an active member of Organizations United for the Environment (OUE), the citi zens' group opposing the incinera tor, believes that the University has already set a precedent. Noting that the Board of Trustees voted in 1986 to divest from companies doing business in South Africa, Sackrey said, ""On the level of political issues, its perfeedy analogous. In principle, what's the difference?"" Like the apartheid contro versy, Sackrey called the current question ""a decision to join a politi cal struggle on one side instead of the other. There have to be things in the external world the University See INCINERATOR, page 2 Colin Bridgewater/The Bucknellian President Gary Sojka explained that the University would not be tak ing a stand on the incinerator issue out of concern for ""the rights of the individual.'' By Bob Minnich StaffWriter Students, faculty, and admin istrators discussed the future of the Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) program at Bucknell in two public forums this week. Discussion focused primarily on the military's policy of not allowing homosexuals into the armed forces and the finan cial impact of losing ROTC schol arship money if the University sev ers ties with the organization. Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Maclver, head of the University's ROTC program, addressed the issue of scholarships, stating that ROTC scholarships pay 80 percent of a cadet's college tuition and fees. At Monday's forum, Maclver stated that ROTC pays over $600,000 an nually to Bucknell, money that pro vides scholarship funds to students who have agreed to enter the armed forces after graduation. Richard Skelton, dean of en rollment planning and a ROTC graduate, added that while 44 of the 63 Bucknell cadets receive financial aid from ROTC, only six get supplementary forms of aid from the University. The cost of replacing the potential loss would be approxi mately $75,000. He saidthe loss would be a ""drain"" on the Univer sity. Skelton expressed concern that the loss of any student because of the inability to replace scholarship funds would hurt middle income families the hardest. The diversity of the stu dent body would be diminished if any ROTC students had to transfer for financial reasons and, according to Skelton, Bucknell could not re place them with students of an equal academic caliber. Skelton said he ""feels that the loss of any student is inreplaceable."" The second major issue ad dressed at the public forums was the Department of Defense's policy against admitting homosexuals into the armed forces. Susan Zingale, assistant director of residential life for developmental programs, said that she and other members of FLAG (Friends of Lesbians and Gays) be lieve that the Defense Department policy is a ""blatant act of discrimi nation."" Zingale said that despite the policy, FLAG does not advocate disassociation from ROTC. Two ROTC cadets also spoke, giving their opinions of the program. Joseph Locascio '91 and Amanda Stone '91 spoke of the importance of the program to them and to the Bucknell community. Locascio stressed the leadership qualities en couraged and developed through ROTC, saying that he has ""learned See PUBLIC FORUMS, page 2 Colin Bridgewater/The Bucknellian Larry Shinn, vice president for academic affairs, along with Barry Maxwell,vice president for administration, attended the ROTC public forums this week. By Chris Drowne StaffWriter Behind a stifling defense, the Breakin' Bison shut down fifth- seeded Army yesterday, 67-49 to advance into the second round of the Patriot League Tournament at Holy Cross. For the twelfth time in 15 post-season tournaments, Head Coach Charlie Woollum has the Bison in the second round. The defense held the Cadets to just 31 percent field goal shoot ing. At the other end of the court, Bucknell shot 53 percent and built up as much as an 18-point lead. ""We were patient on defense, and we did not try to steal the ball,"" commented Woollum. The only concern the Bison had coming into the game was whether or not Army Head Coach Tom Miller could pull off another post-season miracle. As Colorado's coach last season, Miller took the Buffs, who had not won a conference game all season, to the Big Eight Conference Finals. No such luck this time. When Army's leading scorer, James Collins went down with a knee injury midway through the second half, the Cadets looked to Patriot League Rookie of the Year Dave Ardayfio for their points. But, Steve Leshinski '91 held him to just eight points. After the game, Bill Courtney '92 explained that the key to the Bison win was that ""we kept our composure, we were patient, and we played our game."" Courtney's 16 points led four Bucknell players in double figures. He was also one of six Bison to record a blocked shot. See MEN'S HOOPS, page 16"

New energy system lowere,
campus electricity costs,"By Timothy Amman Bucknell has recently in stalled a new $500,000 cogenera tion unit saving the University an estimated $200,000 per year in en ergy costs by using excess steam to generate electricity. The excess steam is a byproduct of the University's steam heating system, which is run by the physical plant and heats campus buildings. Although Bucknell has used cogeneration since the early 1950's, recent technological im provements in the process now al low the University to provide up to 25 percent of the campus' electric ity needs. This new cogeneration sys tem can also keep the campus self sufficient during brief power out ages. The process which creates cogeneration starts when Bucknell's coal -fired boilers pro duce steam for heating and absorp tion air conditioning. The steam is generated at 175 pounds per square inch (psi) and must be reduced to 11 psi to be put to use. The excess steam from this process is fed through a turbine/generator unit to produce electricity. The two individuals most in- \ ________"

Hawley and Noll worked on the project de sign along with outside consulting firms to create the system best fitted to Bucknell's needs. Hawley graduated with a bachelors degree in mechanical en gineering from Bucknell in 1972, and later went on to receive his masters degree. Mike Noll gradu ated with a bachelors degree from the Williamson Free School of Me chanical Trades and also attended the John Wannamaker School of Artisans. Although cogeneration in creases Bucknell's output potential, the University still must buy elec tricity from Pennsylvania Power and Light (PP&L). This is because, in regard to electrical power, ""We don't have enough steam to supply the campus,"" according to Hawley. However, he adds that ""our effi ciency is greater than PP&L's with cogeneration because they lose much of their output as steam."" Bucknell's ratio of energy out per unit of coal burned is 2:3, while PP&L's ratio is closer to 1:3."

BYOB--,"From page 1 ability would be moved to the indi vidual student, said Dadez. Maguire said that he and a group of fraternity presidents will develop of viable mechanism for implementing BYOB. According to Maguire, he and Kristine Elliott '92, president of Panhel, have already developed a draft of the policy, with the amount of beer allowed to be consumed still to be resolved with the administration. Under the University's current alcohol policy, only one beer may be consumed ev ery hour, allowing a student four beers for a registered party. Maguire said, ""We'd like it to be a six-pack for a registered party."" Students ""will come in with X beers, give them up to brothers, and receive X tickets....[To redeem a beer] you go to the 21 year old sec tion, they card you, and you ex change a ticket for a beer,"" Maguire explained. He also noted that the policy ""is so cut and dried that it limits flexibility."" Maguire noted that this policy will change the face of Bucknell's social life. ""I can see the University not liking it. The University has put the social burden on the fraternities which has set us up for criticism by the faculty...but that is where the University would like the social burden to lie."" Maguire predicted that ""people will drink downhill and maybe consume more hard alcohol. There will be greater pre-partying, and it will definitely change the so cial atmosphere of the school."" Although Maguire realized that implementation will ""take a couple semesters at least, but we'd like at least one trial weekend some where towards the end of the se mester."""

Incinerator,"From page I takes a stand on....We've already crossed that bridge, it's a question of which things we are willing to do this about."" Clyde Peeling, local reptile specialist and OUE task force coor dinator, said that he understands the University's decision, but that ""I wish they would [take a stand]. I think a prestigious university would carry a great deal of weight."" Sackrey concurred, calling colleges and universities ""part of what cre ates moral leadership in society....W hat would it say if Bucknell took a stand? It would be standing with its community. Unlike Sojka, Peeling said ""I think it would have a greater impact"" if the Uni versity took a stand,"" and agreed with Sackrey that ""there are times when it is important to take a posi tion."" However, Peeling was quick to note that ""President Sojka has been very supportive in a lot of ways. We really appreciate that."" Both Sojka and Peeling did agree that the community's fight against the incinerator is looking more promising. Sojka said he was ""more hopeful...today than I was a few months ago"" that the project can be blocked; he believes there was ""a small underestimation"" by USPCI, Inc. on the amount of opposition their project would meet. Peeling echoed those comments, saying, ""I think it's going well. Just by the way they [USPCI] react, I would say we have them nervous."" Peeling noted that company officials have recently been ex tremely defensive at public meet ings, and that company officials threatened a lawsuit after a USPCI official attending a recent OUE meeting was asked to leave and al legedly physically threatened. Last October USPCI, a unit of the Union Pacific Corporation, first announced plans to construct a $ 100 million hazardous waste incinerator on 700 acres in Gregg Township, north of the village of Allenwood. Since then, the story has gained na tional attention and OUE has gained over 12,000 members in their efforts to oppose the project, and over 50 organizations and individuals, in cluding most municipal govern ments and state and federal legisla tors, have publicly stated their op position to the process. The permitting process which USPCI must follow with the state Department of Environmental Re sources is expected to take two years."
Public forums,"From page 1 more from ROTC than from any other course I've taken in college."" Stone agreed, adding that ""by sev ering ties with ROTC, the University will be limiting options to students."" President Gary Sojka spoke from the audience during Monday's session. Sojka stated that the De fense Department policy barring homosexuals from the military ""seems to be a gratuitous and un necessary stance,"" and that he is working for change. According to Sojka, if Bucknell remains associ ated with ROTC, the University will be better able to pressure the mili tary for change. Janice Butler, director of the Women's Resource Center, also noted that the ROTC policy runs counter to the University's stated policy against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Butler said that students from middle and working class families ""are economically pressured into ROTC,"" and that it is an unjust trade to be pressured to sacrifice one's life for an education. Mollie Janota '91, represent- ing the Umbrella Organization agreed that there is a ""fundamental conflict"" between the University's policy against discrimination and the policy of not allowing homosexual students to receive ROTC scholar ship funds or to enter the armed forces with a commission upon graduation. While she indicated a personal belief that Bucknell should disasso ciate itself with ROTC, the Umbrella Organization does not advocate that policy. Nevertheless, Janota ques tioned how long the University must wait for the policy to change and as serted that ROTC has no place at Bucknell. ""If the organization was discriminating against anyone else, it wouldn't be allowed on campus,''she said. Brian Selmeski '92, a ROTC cadet attending Wednesday's public forum, commented that he was upset ""that there's little attendance at these meetings,"" and that he was ""dis couraged at the approach to recon cile the conflict,"" saying that there is some room to reach a compromise and work for change within the ROTC policy.

Women's Resource Center launches,
sexual assault awareness campaign,By TaraGilligan StaffWriter
Shailor appointed to new,
vice presidency position,"The Women's Resource Center and Psychological Service in an attempt to infor m students about sexual assault, has launched a campus-wide awareness cam paign which will consist primarily of mass mailings and posters. The campaign began Tuesday when students received informational brochures about sexual assault, especially as it relates to college campuses. The heightened campaign against sexual assault is ""not a women's issue. It's a social issue that men and women work to gether to solve,"" said Janice But ler, director of the Women's Re source Center. Butler and Arlyne Hoyt, director of psychological services, coordinated the project The campaign is in its first week. Butler said the Women's Resource Center plans to follow with a campus-wide poster cam paign. The purpose of posters, as well as the mailings, is to increase students' awareness of sexual as sault. The campaign will eventu ally lead to several discussions to be sponsored by the Women's Re source Center in April, Victims' Rights Month. In addition, the Women's Resource Center will provide peer education programs for hall groups, sororities, fraternities, and student organizations. Included in the packet of in formation mailed Tuesday, was a letter explaining the need for such a campaign and statistics about the incidents of acquaintance rape. A guide for Bucknell stu dents, part of the packet, provides information about what to do in the event of a sexual assault. ""Many young women don't think that it can happen and when it does they don't know what to do,"" said Butler, who began work on the guide last year. Students also received in formation on how to avoid sexual assault, especially acquaintance rape. ""I think that the mailing that we just did will reach a lot of people,"" said Kristina Kelly '93, a student on the Women's Resource Advisory Board. Kelly said she watched stu- l dents' reactions as they found the Ashley Chertkof/The Bucknellian Janice Butler, director of the Women's Resource Center, hopes that mass-mailings and posters will help increase student awareness of sexual assault. information packets in their mail boxes. ""I didn't see one woman throw it [the information] out. I did see a lot of men throw it out,"" she said. But even those who did not pay attention to the information will hear about it through ""word of mouth"" Kelly said. Prior to the start of this cam paign, the Women's Resource Cen ter focused sporadically on the topic. ""We have done the programs; we haven't done it in such an organized way,"" said Butler. ""One of the things we're trying to do is demonstrate that Bucknell is committed to addressing this issue seriously,"" she added. In the past, students received information about sexual assault in directly, usually from pamphlets mailed by the security office. The Women's Resource Cen ter will provide additional informa tion to groups requesting it. The center also sponsors a program that is mandatory for all freshman. The program, ""Metamorphosis,"" focuses primarily on date rape. ""We do a mandatory program for all first year students because women who are new to the college setting seem to be the most vulnerable"" to sexual as sault, Butler said. Butler hopes that as a result of the campaign, more organizations will ask for help in sponsoring small group presentations. She ex pects to reach 1000 students this way. Kelly predicted that sororities would be inclined to hold these programs. Concern over sexual assault has received increasing recogni tion throughout the nation. Butler says Bucknell's program is de signed to help both men and women avoid further incidents of sexual assault ""Women can take steps to reduce the risk try to avoid sexual assault but it's really only men who can prevent it They are the ones who need to change their behaviors,"" she said. According to Buder, many incidents of sexual assault are re lated to alcohol. She did say, however, that alcohol cannot be an excuse for rape. Kelly, too, related sexual as saults to alcohol. ""Most campus sexual assaults are fraternity-re lated and that is a fact taken from the people I know, psychological services, and the Women's Re source Center,"" she said. Kelly, herself a member of a sorority, said she would support a mandatory awareness program for students in fraternities and sororities."
Dominguez honored as North,
east IFC President of the Year,"By Andrew Cohen StaffWriter Members of the Panhellenic Council and the Inter-fraternity Council attended the Northeast Panhellenic and Interfraternity Council conferences, respectively, where they won five awards between them, including IFC president of the year, which was won by Mike Dominguez '91. Dominguez was voted presi dent of the year which ""was pretty incredible since there were over 1,000 students there from twelve states,"" said Denis Maguire '93, current IFC president ""Mike had to deal with two very tough semesters."" IFC also received awards for academic excellence, best program ming, and the special achievement award. Maguire explained the last award was due to ""the pressure and controversy the Greek system has gotten here, and how we pulled to gether."" Maguire noted that this was another testament of Dominguez's leadership. Panhel won the award for best faculty relations programming this year under the leadership of past president Samantha Gladish '91. Kristine Elliott '92, president of Panhel, explained that in addition to receiving the award, her board got several ""new ideas... on issues such as hazing, sexism, faculty relations, and philanthropy."" By Timothy W. Kirk Following a major restructur ing of the administration, current Special Assistant to the President Barbara Shailor has accepted an ap pointment to the newly created posi tion of vice president for student services. Incorporating the duties of special assistant to the president, as sociate vice president for student life, and vice president for academic services and planning, President Gary Sojka has announced the es tablishment of the new office as a major step in ""providing for all of our students a holistic education that benefits from the significant interac tion of curricular, co-curricular, and extracurricular opportunities."" Emphasizing the effort of the administration to ""maximize the benefits to all students of the pres ence of residential colleges and to enhance the social, religious, ethnic, and international diversity"" on cam pus, Shailor sees the restructuring as ""an attempt to enhance all the good things at Bucknell."" One of her main tasks is a vigorous pursuit of faculty/ student interaction, specifically in a co-curricular setting such as that of the residential college. The official responsibilities of the office include: ""Admissions; Athletics, Career Development, Fi nancial Aid, Medical Services, the Multiculture Center, Psychological Services, R.O.T.C., the Registrar's Office, Residential Life, Student Life, Student Activities and Orienta tion, the Weis Center and Cultural Events, and the Women's Resource Center."" Though admittedly cover ing a wide spectrum of services, the emphasis will be put on their effec tiveness to the student. ""My own feeling,"" Shailor comments, ""is that student initiative is really important. We in the administration can plan as much as we want, but if that's not what students are interested in...then it's not going to work."" The admin istration seeks to integrate the entire student life, and this office is a ma jor step in that direction. Shailor, who first began work ing at Bucknell in 1975, is a profes sor of classics, specializing in Latin. She took the position of Associate Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences in 1986, served as Associ ate Provost for a short time follow ing that, and is currently Special Assistant to the President and Affir mative Action officer. Shailor will Ashley Chertkof/The Bucknellian Barbara Shailor, special assistant to the president, will be assuming a new administrative role."
"Students, staff, faculty form",
SOS in support of troops,M M l By Elizabeth Danneberg StaffWriter
A,"recent addition to Bucknell's campus is an alternative to STOP (Students and Teachers Organized for Peace), a group named, SOS, for ""Support Our Sol diers"". The group's intention is, just as the name implies, to support the troops, and also to help those in the local area cope with the absence of their loved ones serving in the Middle East SOS, created by Christine Degnon '92 and Janelle Oltorik '93, composed of twelve members, lists among its ranks, students, faculty, and staff, half of which have rela tives and/or friends in the Persian Gulf presently. According to Tom Travis, professor of political science, who was asked to advise SOS after having given several talks on cam pus in support of the war, the group has a three-fold purpose. The first is to educate the campus on reasons to support the war. Second, SOS serves as an educational alternative to STOP, a group designed to protest the war. And third, SOS intends to provide a variety of activities to support the troops abroad and their families and friends at home. One such activity is a number of family support groups in the im mediate area, so that those left be hind can share their fears and anxi eties with each other. As many students have seen walking through the Langone Center Mall, SOS has also initiated fund raising drives. One, is the sale of yellow ribbons this week, which in the first two days alone raised $120. Funds are fed through a local family support group called Food Closet and also through the Lewisburg Ar mory, and are allocated to families in the local area who have been de nied an income because relatives have been called to war. SOS has also initiated a food drive for these families who are in need. The group's founders were were both motivated by the fact that their brothers are now serving in the Air Force in the Middle East. Degnon mentioned that she and Oltorik ""felt it was important to do something positive in support of the troops. Whether the people agree with our presence in the Gulf or not our soldiers still need our support at home."" Degnon also said that she was ""happy to do something to help the community in addition to Bucknell."" Two other organizations are also making an effort to assist-SOS.

Bush orders end,
to ground war,"President Bush ordered a cease of all military maneuvers s against Iraq's battered army, declar ing Wednesday night that ""Kuwait is liberated"" and that ""Iraq's army is defeated."" The suspension began at midnight Eastern time and will con tinue as long as Iraq agrees to not launch missile attacks and attacks against allied forces. A permanent cease fire will come only when Iraq agrees to comply with all 12 United Nations resolutions, frees all detained Ku wait citizens and prisoners of war, and reveals to coalition forces the exact location of all land and sea mines Iraq laid in the area. Bush appeared on national television to announce the suspen sion of ground war. ""Iraq's army is defeated. Our military objectives are met. Kuwait is once more in the hands of Kuwaitis in control of their own destiny,"" Bush told the nation. Allies claim a decisive victory over Saddam Hussein's army. General Schwarzkopf reported that in the last two days of fighting, coa lition forces destroyed or captured 3,700 of the 4,230 tanks Iraq had at the start of the war. He also said that 300,000 men, from 29 Iraqi divi sions, had been rendered incapable of action and that at least 50,000 had been taken as prisoners of war. Schwarzkopf reported a high num ber of Iraqi deaths. American casulaties for the entire campaign totaled 79 dead, 213 wounded and 44 missing in action, according to Schwarkopf."
Kuwait reports,
atrocities,"Reports that Iraq captured 40,000 Kuwaitis as they fled north on Tuesday pale in comparison to the atrocities citizens of Kuwait faced in the months since the inva sion of their nation, according to General Norman Schwarzkopf, commander of the United States coalition. ""They are not part of the same human race, the people who did that, as the rest of us are,"" he said, in ref erence to the accounts of torture Iraqis inflicted on Kuwaiti citizens. Despite an attempt to restrict the flow of news, which Defense Secretary Cheney announced Satur day, reports of atrocities filtered through army lines in the final days of fighting. The reports revealed one major weapon Iraq used against Kuwait: torture. Tales of kidnap ping, pillaging and torture were confirmed as allied forces entered Kuwait early in the week. One Kuwaiti army officer re ported that Iraq soldiers poured wa ter over prisoners and applied elec tric current when the captured per sons did not give the satisfactory an swers to questions. Several rumors regarding tor ture in Kuwait could not be substan tiated. Hospital officials dispelled rumors that Iraqis killed 300 chil dren and infants. Evidence indicates that those Kuwaitis concidered op ponents of Iraqi occupation were singled out for rough treatment"
USSR renews ties,
with S. Africa,"As apartheid collapses in South Africa, the Soviet Union has taken strides to renew diplomatic ties severed 36 years ago. The two nations have agreed to establish ""interest sections,"" small working sections set up within the existing Austrian embassies, in each other's capitals. A four day conference in Vienna concluded Wednesday with an agreement between Vladimir Kazimirov, head of the Soviet For eign Ministry's Africa section, and Neil van Heerden, the director-gen eral of the South African Foreign"

But recent efforts by President F.W. de Klerk of South Africa to abolish the system of apartheid rule have caused the Sovi ets to re-establish diplomatic rela tions. The move to re-establish di plomacy between the two nations also comes at a time when the Soviet economy is struggling. ""Gorbachev's economic needs in this case dovetail nicely with de Klerk's political changes,"" one dip lomat said."
Louisiana ties,
"pollution, taxes","In an unprecedented move to discourage industrial pollution, Louisiana has enacted a policy which relates property tax exemp tions to a business's environmental record. The policy went into affect in the December, after officials de termined that many of the same companies which received large ex emptions of property tax were also liable for thousands of dollars in pollution fines. According to new tax rules, Louisiana, the state with one of the largest concentrations of chemical contamination in the nation, will not grant blanket tax exemptions to companies. Instead, it will rate companies based on records of past environmental records. Companies will receive exemptions depending upon where they were placed on the scale. The new policy has been the source of some debate. Industrial groups say that the policy is too harsh and fear that it will cause businesses to leave the state. Envi ronmentalists, on the other hand, say that Louisiana should strengthen the policy, extracting even more money"
Centers to hold,
finance seminar,"Several small business devel opment centers, in affiliation with the state organizations, will sponsor a seminar on financial management using the Lotus 1-2-3 computer pro gram and a personal computer on March 26-28. The workshops, to be held in the Dana Engineering Build ing from 6:30 to 9:30 p.m., will be limited to 16 participants and will carry a charge of S50 per person.

The observatory is located south of the Christie Mathewson stadium, on Stadium Road."
Travis speaks at,
Susquehanna,"Thomas Travis, professor of political science at Bucknell Uni versity, traveled to Susquehanna University Monday to deliver a lec ture entitled ""The Wisdom of War in the Persian Gulf."" Travis, the author of articles concerning conflicts in the Middle East, has done extensive work in American foreign policy and inter national relations. Susquehanna University sponsored the lecture in conjunction with the Upper Susquehanna Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America."
CUNY toughens,
standards,"The trustees of the City Uni versity of New York (CUNY) voted Monday in favor of a new college- preparatory initiative, which would create higher standards for admis sion to the university system. The program would require incoming freshmen to have completed a more rigorous academic curriculum in high school or to complete the extra courses at CUNY to make up the difference. The plan should be phased in over the next few years, beginning in the fall of 1992. University offi cials claim that the higher admission standards still will have no affect on CUNY's open admissions policy."

Three die in,
Philadelphia fire,"Three firefighters died Mon day in a fire that raged for over 18 hours in a Philadelphia office tower. The fire caused devastating damage on eight floors, and officials feared that the top of the 38 story building might collapse. Investigations following the fire revealed a total damage of $100 million. The estimated worth of the building before the fire was $160 million. According to fire officials, the fire was worse than any other in the last decade and could have been controlled in an hour had a sprinkler system been implemented on every floor. Only after sprinklers on the top ten floors began working did the fire begin to subside. Firefighters left the building by 7:30 a.m. fearing a collapse of the structure. The blaze was not extin guished until 3 p.m. The three who were killed had signaled for help by midnight, saying that their air tanks were nearly empty. A rescue heli copter did not reach them in time."
Bush considers,
bank reforms,"The Bush Administration has, in the past month, received numer ous proposals for bank reform, all of which have called for increased de regulation in respect to commercial banks. The reform would mean a decrease in the federal government's role in saving faltering banks through deposit insurance. Rather than focus on ways to restore failing banks during the next crisis, the proposals center instead on preventing the government from having to shoulder the banks' bur den in the next bank crisis. The recent proposals focus heavily on deregulation if the Con gress enacts a new banking law, it too will place less emphasis on government interaction. Presum ably, banks would be expected to acknowledge more openly that they are operation, in part, with uninsured deposits. Two levels of banking would be the likely outcome of such a bill. On one level, customers could have deposits federally insure. At the other, customers would receive high interest rates on uninsured deposits."

Bathrooms: A ce reporter evaluates,
the best and the worst on cam pus,"By David Soli Staff Writer The beauty of Bucknell's campus is certainly one of the university's greatest strengths. But, some people complain that the end less stream of red brick and white trim become a bit monotonous after a while. There is some diversity to be found though, of all places, in the bathrooms. A stroll through Bucknell's restrooms reveals the passage of time and the correspond ing changes in bathroom decor. A Classic The best place to start is with the men's restroom in Vaughan Lit erature. Among the oldest restrooms on campus, it has a great deal of character. The door is made of a deep brown wood with ""men"" painted on the door itself and on the frame. The sound of the functioning plumbing is prominent, but some what comforting. Due to the harsh lighting, one feels like an apprehen sive patient in the doctor's office wearing one of those paper robes. A Travesty The most obvious contrast to the Vaughan Literature bathrooms are the pathetically stark Chemistry restrooms. Any restroom in which one has to make two right turns to get to the urinals is extremely sus pect. The door has an annoying handle to match the rest of the an noying handles in the Chemistry building. The restroom's most mys tifying aspect is its abundance of space which serves absolutely no function. The irony of this struck me; it is the efficient Chemistry building after all. The granite is piti fully fake and the tiles resemble hues"
Bison Tales,
The Doting Gome...Lame!,"By Marc Haimes Staff Writer Remember ""GOING"" with people in junior high school? It was easy. A guy would purpose fully stride over to the appropri ate girl, place his hands deep in side the pockets of his parachute pants, look up into her eyes and bravely squeak, ""Will you ask your friend Norma if she likes me... only don't tell her I asked you to ask her...unless she says she DOES like me... then ask her if she'll 'GO' with me."" Of course, no one actually resolved where exactly you were supposed to ""GO."" The more se rious couples did eat lunch at the same table, and talk on the phone. Some even had their parents drive them to miniature golf together. And nothing was more exciting than seeing a couple casually stroll by HOLD ING HANDS! The big scandal in 7th grade Outdoor Education was when Andrew and Sarah (who had been ""GOING"" for a few weeks and were pretty seri ous) made out ""for like two min utes"" in a bush after a romantic evening of promenades and allemand lefts at the late night square dance. Then, Sarah got mad when Andrew accidently cut the inside of her lip with his braces and, after an intense con sultation with all the females in Mr. Evan's class, decided that she and Andrew would ""just be friends."" Well, the junior high school days are over. We re ceived our driver's licences, got our braces off, and most of us no longer sport parachute leg-wear. As far as the dating game is concerned, we've abandoned our romantic Dos-i-dos in favor of a more chaotic slam-dance... that still doesn't ""GO"" anywhere. I think a major catas trophe in our romantic evolution was the elimination of the middle man. It is no longer socially ac ceptable to hide bashfully in your room while your best friend makes the love connection. Now, we have to rely entirely on vibes that a potential love-inter est gives off. My personal prob lem with vibes is that trying to interpret them leads to over analysis. .. which, in turn, causes nausea and insomnia... Hmmmmm, when / made that joke about the parrot with the bladder control problem she waited before she laughed. Why did she do that? Does that mean she was only laughing to make me happy and she really thinks I'madork? Or maybe she didn't think it was funny but she laughed because she really DOES LIKE me?!? Or maybe she really DID think it was funny, but still doesn't like me. But then again, if she DID like the joke, maybe she changed her mind, and now she really DOES LIKE me!!! But, what if she finds out what I did to Sarah's mouth with my braces in 7th grade???!!!!! ""Don't worry so much and just be yourself!"" is the standard advice that friends give you, when you wake them up at 4:00 a.m. babbling idiotically about bloody lips and parrot excre ment. HA!!! I tried ""being my self' once, and it just doesn't work. The reason for this is be cause most of the time ""being yourself' is in direct conflict with OFFICIAL DATING RULE #1 which is... Never Be Yourself. You see, ""Being Yourself"" implies that you are using the ""honesty"" approach which will NEVER, EVER do the trick. If you were to look for honesty on the Official List of the Top 100 Most Desirable Traits That People Look For, you would notice that it is an extremely low priority. In the updated 1991 version of the list, ""honesty"" ranked 73'rd, right between ""healthy-looking toes"" and ""sin cerity."" Oh sure, people SAY they want honesty, but when all the hearts are on the table, honesty doesn't hold a romantic candle to the two top ranked, MOST desir able traits which are... Think you know?

Despite, or per haps because of, its many techno logical advances (anti-splash uri nals), the Chemistry bathroom is extremely uninviting, especially to all those types who just want to complete their lab science require ment. A Smooth Transition The library restrooms occupy the middle ground between the old and new, between modem and ro botic. It does have some faults, namely that the paper towel rack is separated from the sink area by an unnecessary wall. This is bewilder ing, and results in many wet T-shirts. The restroom's better features in clude two-tone signs at the door and full-length mirrors, which are essen tial on Upper Level 2 where more socializing than studying takes place. Like the Vaughan restrooms, one can hear the churning of the pipes in the other restrooms in the library, lending a human feel to the otherwise thoroughly modern restroom. Whichever restroom in the library one prefers, one is assured of a positive experience. The Best of the Best The best restroom on campus though is the Men's Lounge on 2nd floor ELC. Its leather couches are Peter Ho / The Bucknellian Selected the classisest of all campus bathroom, Vaughan Literature mens' bathroom features fine marble and dark oak woodwork. Peter Ho / The Bucknellian The Bertrand Library's second-floor men's bathroom offers a relax ing atmosphere for catching up on some light reading. ideal for loafing, though I've never seen anyone do so. The idea of hanging out in a restroom somehow doesn't appeal to most Bucknellians. But with the strains of CNN coming through the television set hookup and a pay phone, one could spend hours in the Men's Lounge. The sanitation facilities are quite exem plary, thus making the Men's Lounge the premier restroom on campus. Despite this diversity, there were a few constants when it came to Bucknellians feelings about their restrooms. Everybody seems to hate push faucets, even environmental ists. 'They always turn off before I'm done,"" complains John Caldwell '92. There was also a consensus when it came to wondering why the restroom on the bottom floor of the Langone Center formerly had quo tation marks around the men and women designations on the restroom doors. Next time you use the restroom, do more than heed to Mother Nature, observe what's around you and consider the great variety of experiences available to you on the Bucknell campus."

Former diplomat teaches at Bucknell,

nerienCQ  to  ClOSSiOOm,"By Lisa Lipari Staff Writer Before coming to Bucknell last fall, International Relations Pro fessor Basil Ince had a career in the Foreign Service as well as in ama teur athletics. Born in Trinidad, a small country off the coast of Venezuela, Ince came to the United States to study at Tufts University in Boston. After receiving his graduate degree in International Relations from New York University, Ince became the United Nations delegate to Trinidad in 1962. Following his two-year term at the UN, Ince then taught in the States at various universities, including State University of New York at Binghamton and the University of Puerto Rico. He returned to Trinidad to teach at the University of West Indies, and later became the Director of the Institute of International Rela tions there. After 17 years in the teaching profession, Ince was elected Foreign Minister of Trinidad and Tobago in 1981. The selection committee ""ap parently felt that I must know some thing about the subject,"" Ince said modestly about his qualifications for the position. More accurately, his published articles on international relations in the Caribbean attracted world-wide attention to his expertise in the politics of that area. As foreign minister, Ince's primary responsibility was the analysis of reports from Trinidadian diplomats. Ince then determined policy for the state of Trinidad, at tempting to ""present Trinidad to the world"" in the best manner possible and to ""serve its own people."" Ince most frequently handled the nation's economic and trade-re lated issues. Since Trinidad was a British colony until 1962 and is to day a state within the British Com monwealth, Trinidad has historically enjoyed preferential trade relations with the United Kingdom. When the United Kingdom joined the Commo Market, Ince worked to assure that the beneficial trade arrangements would continue. Ince was also involved in the negotiations over a maritime bound ary between Venezuela and Trinidad. His committee sought a peaceful settlement of the dispute over where to demarcate (meaning ""to physically designate"") the terri- torial lines in the sea. In addition to his success in the political world, Ince was also outstanding in athletics. A member of the Tufts University track team, he set a university record in the 400 meter. He later ran for Trinidad in the 1959 Pan-American games and won a gold medal for the 1600 meter relay and a silver medal for the 400 meter. Ince was selected for the Olympics in 1960, but was unable to compete because he became ill. Commented Ince, ""If there were any disappointments in my life, that was one of them."" He still likes to jog and lift weights and is a music and the ater enthusiasL As ""the new kid on the block"" at Bucknell, Ince is teaching a new course both this semester and next semester on International Relations in the Caribbean.

What happens when globe-trotting,
Bucknellians return to Lewisburg?,
Or,
.;,
who are these people and what am I doing here?,"By Jen Marshall Staff Writer ""Great! I'm prepared for any thing now!"" I thought as I zipped the bulging bag that I was taking with me to Italy on my study abroad program. I had packed pictures of my family, house, and dog, many is sues of Cosmopolitan, a dictionary of Italian slang, my favorite pillow case, and a handy travel map of Italy. Sure that I had packed every possible cure for homesickness and culture- shock, I set off for my Italian adven ture. My preventative measures against homesickness and culture- shock were effective, and I had a wonderful time in Milan. I con gratulated myself on being so smart and avoiding that silly homesickness trap. Unfortunately, there was a whole other side to the problem that I had not foreseen... What happens when an ex change student returns home to the United States after an extended stay abroad? Can't he or she feel a sort of shock and estrangement towards American society, much like the shock felt when first arriving in a foreign country? In the excitement of preparing for a stay abroad, these considerations are often neglected. Yet, sometimes the return home can be as traumatic and unsettling as the first few days abroad. These con cerns are of special importance to Bucknellians, as 143 students were abroad last fall, and 99 are abroad this semester. You or a friend of yours could be experiencing these same re-entry problems right this very second. Not everyone has difficulty with returning to America, in fact some just plop back in front of the TV with LA. Law like they had never left. For others, the transition isn't so easy. According to Arlyne Hoyt, director of Psychological Services, students may feel es tranged from friends because so much has happened since they left and they think that it will be impos sible to ""catch up"". Others feel they have matured in ways that their friends haven't, and therefore they can't relate. Also, Hoyt said, America doesn't always look like the golden land anymore, and ethnocentric illu sions are shattered. Bucknell sud denly isn't the glorious center of the world anymore, it has lost a bit of luster. With all of these thoughts and emotions running through one's brain, no wonder re-adjusting can be difficulL Elizabeth Kormeier '91, spent two semesters in France and said that her first month back in the United States was hard. ""You change, friends change, you aren't in the same cliques anymore. Sometimes it was hard to relate because I was wrapped up in my abroad experience and they were wrapped up in what ever they had been doing here."" Elizabeth also missed the in dependence and mobility that she had while abroad. (For those of you who don't know, Europe is equipped with a wonderful, cheap, train sys tem that can take you anywhere. And best of all, there are no parents or other such annoying authority figures to squash your travels.) Another Bucknellian who ex perienced a sort of culture shock upon returning to Bucknell was Dominic Madigan '91. Dominic spent four months in Kenya last se mester and when he returned to America he was shocked at the ex tent of our materialism. Living a simple life in Kenya made him sen sitive to our tvays of excess, he said. He also felt estranged from his peers for a time, because it was difficult to relate fully the extent of his experi ences in Africa. Dominic felt that he had grown in ways that he couldn't expect his peers to understand be cause they had not been to Kenya. Happily, life did get better for these Bucknellians. Readjustment can take anywhere from a few days to a few months, but it will eventu ally happen. How can you make your transition easier? Hoyt suggests allowing your self to feel these strange emotions of alienation and share them. Talking to others that have been through cul tural readjustment can help, too, she said. Madigan also advocates find ing and talking to people who have had similar experiences-whether they have visited the same country as you or they are just feeling ""out of iL"" If you know someone who has just returned from a study abroad, there are things you can do to help them readjust to Bucknell life, ac cording to Hoyt. Let them know that you are glad they're back and that you missed them. Take the time to fill them in on what happened when they were away; be as willing to listen to their stories about the trip. If you think your friend is acting re ally strange, don't be afraid to say something or even suggest that they visit a counselor. Friends can go a long way in helping a person to re acclimate themselves to Bucknell, or any other foreign place."

"BYOB: ""Isn't there a better way?""","A new alcohol policy which promises to once again change the character of Bucknell's social life will soon go into effect The dreaded ""BYOB"" or ""bring your own beer"" policy, which is already plaguing the University of Pennsylvania, Penn State, and the University of Maryland, will soon infect Bucknell. The policy is an underhanded attempt on behalf of fraternity nationals and insurance companies to shift liability to individual fraternity members. Unlike previous efforts to shift to a BYOB policy, the University is not spearheading this attempt. The action is not without reason. Fraternities have borne the brunt of a number of lawsuits, and there have even been recent examples at Bucknell. Just last December, Tau Kappa Epsilon was fined $1300 in connection with underage drinking charges filed by Lewisburg Police. If fraternities continue to purchase common sources of alcohol and are caught, they will face disciplinary action from their nationals; this action might be as severe as chapter derecognition. If, on the other hand, indi vidual fraternity members purchase the common sources of alcohol, they alone will bear the liability. No longer will fraternity brothers be insulated from liability by their national's insurance policies. Ironically, some fraternity brothers have expressed their support for BYOB, arguing that the policy will relieve fraternities of the financial burdens associated with supplying thirsty patrons. Perhaps. But the fact re mains that the nationals have turned their backs on brothers who might violate the new policy; in such a case the fraternity's insurance policy will do nothing to protect those brothers. BYOB, if enforced, will stifle fraternity parties and create problems both on- and off-campus. It will force parties into town where BYOB restrictions aren't in effect, and the resulting parties are sure to worsen town- gown relations. Students driving to and from in-town parties will create yet another hazard. Worse still, the increasing difficulty of obtaining beer will push students toward hard alcohol consumption and drug use--a dangerous attempt at a more powerful buzz. Finally, the number and magnitude of dorm parties will increase, placing more burdens upon already dis gruntled Resident Assistants. In any case, it is questionable how much effect the policy will have. The possibilities for evasion are nu merous. Will security monitors be able to effectively tag and distribute beer for a large number of students? What is to prevent students from placing 4 (or 6) beers on reserve at a number of different fraternities and simply riding the circuit? A new BYOB policy holds no benefits for Bucknell; it is little more than another misguided attempt to control the uncontrollable--underage and irresponsible drinking. It is even doubtful that any Bucknell chapters will reap the benefits of lower insurance policy rates. Isn't there a better way?"

Former professor of,
military science argues,
for ROTC's retention,"To the Editor: As a framer Professor of Military Science at Bucknell, I see three fundamental flaws in the rationale presented for ban ning ROTC. First, a soldier is neither immoral nor corrupt. Citizen-soldiers founded this country and remain important members of our community today. ROTC remains the em bodiment of the citizen-soldier concept. Through its presence on over 400 colleges and univer sities across the country, ROTC creates an officer corps that truly represents the diversity that is America. More importantly, it reaffirms our commitment to civilian control over the military by giving the university a role in the selection of military officers. Only those meeting the school's degree requirements receive commissions. To say that the training and selection of the military leaders of our Armed Forces is beneath Bucknell ignores the significance of these tasks. To scorn and ostracize the young men and women choosing to devote a portion of their lives to defending the nation that gave them so much ignores their courage and patriotism. To con tinually ban groups with differ ing views or beliefs is inconsis tent with the University's con cept of academic freedom. A wise Englishman once said, ""A country that draws a sharp line of demarcation be tween its thinking men and its fighting men will find its fight ing done by fools and its think ing done by cowards."" Secretary Cheney does not strike me as a coward; General Powell does not strike me as a fool. We should all be grateful that our system to select our military leaders works. It underscores the importance of continuing to draw officers from Bucknell and schools of its cali ber. Secondly, strong and ready Armed Forces are not a result of the denunciation of those who join; strength comes from en couraging the very best to join. There is no shame in the high percentage of minorities in mili tary leadership roles, only pride. It indicates that the Armed Forces offer more opportunities, based on ability, than do other careers. The Armed Forces should be congratulated, not condemned, for offering scholar ships to students with outstand ing academic and leadership abilities. Our nation's future depends on well educated young men and women. Finally, an even bigger flaw in the argument is the per ception that any organization with differing concepts, beliefs, or precepts can be done away with. I'm sony, I don't agree. America doesn't work that way. Col. Michael A. Ellicott Feb. 15,1991"

Professor responds to parent's,
wish to cease S.T.O.P. activities,"To the Editor: I would like to address Diane Oltorik's letter, published in The Bucknellian of February 15. Mrs. Oltorik, I would respectfully suggest that what you would have President Sojka do about S.T.O.P. would undermine just those American values that you so fervently affirm. What could our freedom of speech possibly mean if it did not protect the rights of those with unpopular views to put forth those views, not only in words, but in acts and symbols? What is at stake here is not destruc tion or defacement of university property, for the chalk washes away, and the symbolic graves left no trace when they were removed. They were simply a dramatic way of making a point ready agree with them. What rights, whose rights, are infringed by S.T.O.P.? Do we re ally have a right to be protected from ideas that upset us or offend"
What could our freedom of speech possibly,
mean if it did not protect the rights of those,
"with unpopular views to put forth those views,",
"not only in words, but in acts and symbols?","People in the majority have the same right to make their point dramatically, but have less need to do so, since most people al- us? If I have a right to be protected from ""sanctimonious rhetorical images,"" does that entitle me to demand that broadcast of President Bush's speeches be stopped? Of course not! The first obligation of this o: any university is not to protect its students from ideas they find dis agreeable, but rather to confront them with alternative ways of thinking, so that they may better develop their own thinking. This commitment to the free exchange of ideas is the great contribution c the United States to civilization. I: this not the freedom that our troop are said to be fighting for?

Student criticizes peers for apathn,"To the Editor: for his initiative. these. sessions nn the u/nr h,vp h *.(tm) . * In light of the Bucknellian's student survey of last week [Febru ary 15,1991], I would like to ask those same 79 students, ""Do you really care or try hard enough to find out what is happening in the Persian Gulf?"" President Sojka (finally) put together a teach-in last Sunday [February 17,1991] in Vaughan Literature Auditorium at which there were an embarrassing 30 or so students in attendance. Were you too busy, too hung over, or just too apathetic to attend? With a war raging in the Middle East possibly killing hundreds of thou sands of human beings--soldiers and civilians, allies and Iraqis-- can't you take a few hours to actu ally find out what's going on? This was a prime opportunity in educa tion and I applaud President Sojka for his initiative. By the way, does the word education sound familiar to any one? Last I knew, that's why we're here in the first place. There are an overwhelming num ber of political, economic, eco logical, social, and religious causes and consequences in volved in this conflict that we just do not learn from CNN. I understand that some of you may not have seen the banner and signs in the ELC or the blurbs in The Bucknellian and elsewhere advertising this event, but I know that more than 30 of you did. I am actually tempted to take yet another opinion poll: ""Of those Bucknell students who actually care, how many supprart this war?"" It has continually amazed me that the great major ity of those students attending these sessions on the war have been opposed to it Do all you war sup porters know everything already? My accusation of apathy is not unfounded nor isolated. Students and Teachers Organized for Peace organized an other teach-in lasting 8 hours with 7 professors speaking last November. The turnout was the same. I know that more than those p)eople were aware of that one because someone kept going down to the Bison during the Grand Opening to announce it. But those p)eople didn't come either. (My brother and a friend drove 5 hours to attend.) There have also been other such events sponsored by S.T.O.P. and academic dep>artments at which the story has been the same. If you think you know everything there is to know, I refer you to the presence of several members of the faculty, administration and suppx>rt staff on hand at Sunday's teach I hardly think many of us know more than those who are both c and have devoted their lives to academia. But they realized, as should, that you can never knot too much about something as ir portant as this. Everyone can b< efit from new viewpoints, even you. I do not doubt that the stu body supports our troops in the desert, but if you really care ab them, I'd think you would warn know why they are there in the place, what they might be expra encing and what might happran when this is over. Demonstrate your concern; the time for idle is over. Come out from under tl bubble and face war like adults Jessen Havill '94 Feb. 19,1991 b"

Should Bucknell sever university ties,
with ROTC?,
>t,"Ed Mulligan '92 Electrical Engineering Gene Chenoweth Professor of Political Science Greg May '92 English Kristi Kelly '93 Economics Maulik Trivedi '91 Biology Julie McCausland '91 Biology No. I don't think they should sever the ties. The program provides a service to students, enabling them to go to college. After all, it's voluntary and is not forced on anyone. In the future these p)eople may be in positions of military px>wer and it's nice to know they have a well-rounded education behind them."

________,"Ours is a fundamentally and pro foundly violent culture. Higher education's contribution to that consists of more than its affiliations to the ROTC program. I doubt that severing ties with ROTC will get to the heart of the matter as the uni versity should endeavor to do. We should insist that ROTC cease to discriminate on the basis of gender and sexual preference. ___________ There are ROTC students who are making positive contributions to this University; one they could not have attended without ROTC money. If Bucknell decides that it wants to continue training officers, fine. The military, although often misused, serves a necessary func tion in this world: defense. If BU decides to sever ties, it must find the scholarship money elsewhere. While I don't agree with the Fed eral government's stipulations, nor with Jenk's proprasal that ROTC only teaches people to kill, I be lieve the ROTC program adds diversity which every liberal arts college should have. I think it's right that Jenks opposes the discrimination against gays and lesbians. All people should be allowed to be in ROTC. I think ROTC is a good program for pieople who genuinely want to do it. We arc lacking scholarship pro grams here at Bucknell, so if people without the money want to get a Bucknell education, they must sell their lives away to the Army. No, because I feel that you can not simply look at an issue from an ideal !joint of view. I'm not in favor of war and killing but I think that this is not all that ROTC does. Furthermore, lots of pjeople depend on ROTC to at tend Bucknell."

Prescription,"By David Skena A prescription is, according to Webster, a written direction for a therapeutic or corrective agent. The goal of this column is not simply to cite problems but also to offer pos sible solutions to them, the intent is to be constructive, not accusatory. Although Bucknell is a healthy institution, one can always improve it and make it stronger than it ever was before. Faculty/ Student relations are my current concern. Larry Shinn once explained, and I agree with him, that it seems as though the faculty members have general complaints about the stu dents but when asked if they have any good students they are able to sound off at least a half dozen with out hesitation. The opposite is also true; we, as students, complain about the actions of the faculty as a whole but are able to name several profes sors that we enjoy and resptect. What I think is missing is the out-of-the-classroom interaction that many students anticipated would occur at a small liberal arts college. The respranse to this complaint by many faculty is that they are under so much pressure to do so many things that informal interaction with students simply falls to the bottom of the priority list and is rarely ac complished. So how can this lack of informal communication be ad dressed? Well, the responsibilities of the professors are not likely to di minish and the work load of students is also cumbersome. I recommend that the time and the place for this kind of interaction is lunchtime in the Langone Center. Why? The Langone Center is convenient for everyone, our brand new Bison is a nice 'neutral' place to be and students with meal plans can treat their professor to a free meal at the caf., the Terrace Room or a Buttery via the OSA's Meal Con nection program. We all have to eat so why not use the time to get to know each other better as individu als. Professors, tell your students that they are welcome to join you for lunch. Students, make the effort to be there and try using 'The Meal Connection.' Animosity between students and faculty is a problem that must be worked on individually and collectively. I have presented a few steps all of us can take individually but I can't force any of my medicine down your throat. Do what is com fortable, but do something. My next article will concern how this problem can be addressed collectively through campus governance. I' 11 see you in the Bison. Editor's Note: ""Skena's Prescrip tion"" will appear every other week in this section of The Bucknellian."

Student addresses parking,
problems on campus,"To the Editor: I would like to address the parking problem. My car is registered; so far I've received three tickets and we're only three weeks into the semester. I know I am not alone in this problem as I'm sure the De partment of Security and Safety is well aware due to the number of tickets they issue. I can under stand giving tickets to cars that are blatandy parked illegally for the sake of being closer to the dorm build ings, but that is not the issue here. So many times I have searched the lot behind Lambda Chi only to find there are absolutely no student park ing spots available. Where should one go when this happrans? I am sorry, but I do believe that the De partment of Security and Safety has made a classical error in allowing more praople to register their cars than there arc parking sprats available. Something must be done about this. The reason I paid a registra tion fee is to be able to park on campus and the Department of Security and Safety is simply not fulfilling its end of the bargain, since there are not enough parking sprats. It is simply not fair to the law-abiding students who are regis tered to have no other option, but to park illegally. Also, I find it ironic to think that when there are no sprats avail able one is still expected to some how miraculously locate a legal sprat, probably quite a distance away, which could be rather unsafe late at night. Also, why is Bucknell allowed to charge $10 prar ticket while the city of Lewisburg only charges $3? I think that one solution would be to limit the number of students allowed to register their vehicles. This could be done on a first come, first served basis and when the number of cars registered is equivalent to the num ber of spaces, registration should be closed. Another alternative would be to increase the number of student parking sprats. I sincerely hopra that the Department of Security and Safety takes some initiative to try to solve this problem because it is very frus trating for the driving population of Bucknell. Dorothy D. Wingrove '92 Feb. 25,1991"

Sojka expresses concern,
about sexual assault issue,"To the Campus Community: These days we all have a lot on our minds. Each of us can be preoccupied with the Gulf War, the ROTC issue, budget crunches, pledge activities, course work, and the list goes on. At this time, how ever, I'd like to ask that we take time out to consider another imprar- tant concern facing universities today-the problem of sexual as sault on campus. This phenomenon appraars to be widespread, affecting one in six college women and one in twelve college men, according to a na tional survey of over 6,000 stu dents conducted by psychologist Dr. Mary Koss, the National Insti tute for Mental Health, and Ms. magazine. Earlier this week, there was a campus-wide mailing to alert stu dents and staff to the problems associated with sexual assault. This mailing is part of a Sexual Assault Awareness Campaign being con ducted at Bucknell. Our aim is to educate the community and, hope fully, prevent sexual abuses from occurring here. The University is committed to addressing this issue in a respransible way that will en able students to reduce their risks and assist them in the unfortunate event that they are victimized. As President, I am concerned"
I want to send the,
message that,
sexual assault will,
not be tolerated at,
Bucknell.,"with the welfare of all students and employees and am supprarting this Awareness Campaign to hoprafully spare some individuals the pxtin and trauma of becoming involved in such incidents. Perhaps most im- prartantly, I want to send the mes sage that sexual assault will not be tolerated at Bucknell. It is a clear violation of the University's Code of Conduct and those who behave in a sexually abusive manner can face severe sanctions. I encourage all individuals to become familiar with the literature and educational resources Bucknell offers. Self-defense workshops, prevention programs for men as well as women, educational videos, counseling, and medical services arc all available. For more details about these resources, contact the Women's Resource Center or Psy chological Services. We can leant from the infor mation currently being dissemi nated and I hope that you will join me in the campaign to make Bucknell a safe living and learning environment for all.

>>WIKI,
Readers reply to professor's letter regarding S.T.O.P.,
L i Tu',
Professor understands McGuire's argument,"To the Editor: I am writing in answer to Professor McGuire's letter objecting to the memo I drafted that was sent to the faculty by S.T.O.P., under several member's names, including Professor Keen's. Having ini tially shared Paul McGuire's concerns, I think I understand them. I was persuaded, though, that it was reasonable to suggest that the faculty bring up the war in the first class meeting of the year. One argument I found persuasive was that students and other members of the university community were being affected by the war. Indeed, when I brought up the topic in my largest class, students who had relatives at the front felt freed to talk about their fears. There were two reasons I still hesi tated to allow this discussion to take place. First, I was wary of a class discussion that might entail presenting my view of the war. As it turned out, the students carried the discussion. Many of them clearly needed and wanted a chance to voice their opin ions, strong feelings, and beliefs. Was it polarizing, as Prof. McGuire suggests? Perhaps. I suspect there were some students who kept their views to themselves and resented other students' impassioned statements. I don't think controversy is out of place in a college classroom, however. As an educator, I think it is important for college students to learn to articulate their ideas and values, and to argue effectively. I sense that Buck- nell students are often reluctant to confront real difference of opinion. I believe that hesitation to engage in argumentation, because it is seen as rude, can hinder intel lectual development. To return to my first concern, I make an effort (not always successful) to keep my political views out of the classroom. I am sure there are a few students in my classes who inferred from my attempted neutrality that I supported the way Presi dent Bush conducted this war. I intention ally revealed my position only to selected students with whom I was having less public discussion, and then only for par ticular reasons and when I believed it was not threatening to them. Consequently, I regret that Professor McGuire revealed my position in his letter to the student newspa per and has made it an issue in my peda gogy. I wish he had taken another route to express his apprehensions and to ascertain exactly what we were proposing. Another reservation I had was that, like Professor McGuire, I thought the dis cussion should be justified by relating it to the course material. Professor Keen, al though he didn't share that concern, helped me identify ways that my discipline can be used to clarify issues related to the war (admittedly an easier task in social psychology than math). The reason we suggested that interested faculty contact Ernie is that, as an experienced teacher, clinical psychologist, and practicing thera- pist, he is skilled at broaching touchy top ics in ways that promote sensitivity to various points of view and individual vul nerabilities. As for the material we offered to send--yes, they were selected articles. Initially deplorably ignorant, I learned much about the Persian Gulf region from my colleagues (not all of them anti-war, by the way) in political science, religion, inter national relations, and economics at the first teach-in. I continued to read about it during January. If the the articles I selected (from such sources as The Village Voice and Journal of the American Medical Asso ciation) support an antiwar perspective, I assume faculty are intelligent and sophisti cated enough to consider the source, judge the quality of the arguments, and extract the information they consider useful. There were several unwarranted assumptions in Professor McGuire's letter: First, that we were suggesting that profes sors expound a position on the war rather than that they facilitate a discussion; sec ond, that open discussion produces polar ization rather than understanding and rap prochement; and third, that our country's involvement in a war that was taking place in a distant country was not, or should not have been, of daily and central concern to those of us safe at home. Chris O'Sullivan Assistant Professor of Psychology February 28<< 1991"
Professor refutes,
letter's concerns,"To the Editor: Having just read Professor McGuire's statements of outrage over a letter sent to faculty members by Students and Teachers Organized for Peace (S.T.O.P.), I felt it necessary to reply as one of the S.T.O.P. members who con curred in the decision to send the letter. As Professor McGuire indicated, the letter encouraged faculty members to take their first class session of the semester to discuss the Persian Gulf war with their students. The letter also indicated the avail ability of a series of articles that S.T.O.P. had collected which could be of use to faculty members discussing particular aspects of the Gulf war. It also called atten tion to the fact that several S.T.O.P. mem bers had expertise in various aspects of the crisis, and that this expertise may be help ful in planning a class discussion. Our decision to ask faculty to take this time to discuss the war was based on many years of experience as students and teachers in which we found that the first day of class was often devoted to lengthy and largely pointless discussion of the mechanics of a course, or involved a short ened session in which syllabi were passed out, attendance was called, and students were dismissed. In the period between semesters our government has initiated a war which had already cost tens of thou sands of lives. As a result of this fact, we thought the actions of our government might have been more worthy of discussion than the usual first day fare. Of course, I have to admit that we made this judgment in total ignorance of the contents of Profes sor McGuire's course plan for the first day of class. Apart from the question of the ethics of disrupting the opening day trivialities to talk about a war, there is a more general question about the ethics of using the class room to discuss material other than that indicated by the course catalogue. Here also I have to confess to having somewhat different ethical standard that Professor McGuire. When I was growing up, I learned about how the Nazis had gassed six million Jews while the German people complacently went about their business. I always found it mindboggling that suppos edly civilized people could conduct them selves in this manner. I hope that if I was ever in similar circumstances I would use whatever forum I might have to oppose such genocide until I was fired or arrested. There is one final point I'd like to make. Professor McGuire indicated some concern about political considerations entering the review process for retention and promotion of faculty as a result of the fact that one of the signers of the letter currently chairs the University Review Committee (URC). There are three mem bers of the administration that also sit on this committee. I think we can all have absolute confidence that these three admin istrators will act to ensure that the URC will never decide against retention or pro motion of a faculty member because he or she has not cooperated with a political organization working to oppose U.S. for eign policy.

Dance & music tomorrow at Weis,"By Laura Grisin Staff Writer Regarded as one of the most distinctive and influential forces in contemporary dance, Laura Dean will bring her company, Laura Dean Dancers and Musicians, to the Weis Center tomorrow night at 8 p.m. ""Laura Dean is, I think, unique as a choreographer who is also a skilled composer and therefore writes the music and choreographs the dance in tandem,"" said William Boswell, director of cultural events. ""Her works are distinctive, using a bold, personal style of evolved pat terns of movement and music. The dancers are meticulously disciplined and the overall effect of this concert should be incredibly powerful and enthralling."" Dean formed the Laura Dean Dance and Music Foundation in 1975, creating a company dedicated to live performance of both music and dance. The ensemble of 11 dancers and four musicians, who ""take over the stage like a small, self-contained tornado,"" according to The Minneapolis Star and Tri bune, has performed and taught in hundreds of cities across the United States and on four continents. In ad dition, Dean's work has been com missioned by the Joffrey Ballet, the New York City Ballet and the Royal Danish Ballet. Courtesy of Public Relations Laura Dean Dancers and Musicians will perform three pieces, including ""Magnetic"" (shown above), to morrow at the Weis Center. Dean is unique in that she composes her own music for her choreography. Tomorrow night's program will include three pieces: ""Mag netic,"" ""Inner Circle,"" and ""Infin ity."" The third, which premiered last July at the American Dance Festival, was described by The New York Times as ""a superb example of how rich her choreography can be."" While on campus today, com pany member Anne Wennerstrand offered a modem dance class for students, faculty and residents of Lewisburg. This class is one in a se ries taught by Weis Center perform ers to the Bucknell community. Tickets, $5 with a Bucknell I.D., are still available at the Weis Center Box Office and at the door."
"Bob Dylan rocked Capitol Theatre ""Like A Rolling Stone""","By Brian Tosh and Jon Elliot Staff Writer It has been said that the heart beat of the 1960's, Bob Dylan, has in recent years slowed down to a near flat line. From his stadium tour with the Grateful Dead in the sum mer of 1987 to his recent album re leases, Down In The Grove, Oh Mercy and this winter's Under a Red Sky, critics and fans alike were be ginning to believe that the spark in Dylan which composed such 60's anthems as ""Like a Rolling Stone"" and ""All Along the Watchtower"" had died. But those who traveled to Williamsport's Capitol Theater last Thursday night were treated to a re birth of the music which exemplified the spirit of the Vietnam generation. Bob Dylan, along with John Lennon, was honored the previous night in New York City at the annual Grammy Awards, with a coveted lifetime achievement award. View ers, even Dylan diehards, were a bit confused as to what it was that Dylan muttered as he performed that night, so ticket holders for Thursday night were a bit apprehensive about what to expect. As show time approached, the lines outside diminished. Inside, Penn State local J. R. Mangan and his acoustic guitar entertained the growing crowd. But soon enough, the stage was set for what was to be a most memorable night. Dylan took the stage at 8:30, and for the next two hours Williamsport relived a piece of the 60's with a 90's taste. Dressed in a dark checkered jacket, white hat, and now trademark unkept beard, Dylan thrilled the crowd with what can only be described as one of the best concerts this area has been treated to in a long time. Backed by a four piece electrical band, he pulled out classic tunes such as ""Lay Lady Lay"" and ""All Along the Watch- tower,"" as well as new hits like ""Wiggle, Wiggle."" Dylan played every song with what seemed to be an entirely different rhythmic melody, singing throughout the en tire night with his trademark mumble, as fans both old and new followed along with his every word. After about half a dozen songs, Dylan turned off all the amps and began an anxiously awaited acoustic set. The crowd sat breath lessly as they were treated to such classics as ""Don't Think Twice, Ma"" and ""Mr. Tambourine Man."" For the rest of the night, the band switched back and forth from electric to acoustic equipment, thrilling the fans with such memorable gems as ""Like a Rolling Stone"" and ""Blowin' in the Wind."" Dylan wound up the show and brought down the house with a smoking rendition of ""Maggie's Farm."" Surprisingly, it was some of his newer tunes, such as ""God Knows"" and 'The Man In the Long Black Coat,"" which re ceived most of the applause. The energy and emotion felt that night in Williamsport left the crowd with an uncanny memory of the 1960's and Vietnam. Although Dylan has never been known to speak to his audiences or take a vocal stand on political issues, he usually allows his songs to speak for them selves; and in his immortal words he asks, ""...how many times must the cannonballs fly?"" showing that his music, after nearly three decades. continues to stand the test of time. Editor's Note: J. R. Mangan, who opened for Bob Dylan at the Capitol Theatre, will be performing with his band tomorrow night at the Senior Class ""91 Days 'Till Gradu ation"" Party in Larrison Dining Hall from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m."
'Master,
Harol,
was,
a thundering success,"By Vic Tchiprout In conjunction with Black History Month, the Weis Center presented South African play wright Athol Fugard's'Afasrer Harold... and the Boys last Friday. Thanks to the Asolo Theatre Com pany of Florida, this powerful, award-winning play was kept in the original heart-rending level of its premiere in 1982. Inspired by his experiences in racially divided South Africa, Mr. Fugard casually invites the au dience back into 1950 to a small cozy tea-room in Port Elizabeth. We meet two of the characters on a rainy afternoon as they rehearse for an upcoming ballroom competi tion. Sam (Daryl Edwards), and Willie (Todd Anthony-Jackson) are the two black tea-room waiters who work for the parents of a white South African boy, Hally (Jack Boslet). The cheerful mood of the play becomes apparent as the two waiters josh and chat about their dancing. They are soon joined by Hally, a prep-school boy quickly venturing into manhood. We im mediately become aware of the close relationship between Sam and Hally, and, as the drama devel ops, we are slowly fed details of the boy's childhood experiences with Sam. The script is so well written that it's easy to become engrossed by the imagery. The stories reveal the truth of the Hally's childhood and how the servants have been like surrogate fathers to the boy for many years. We also discover that Hally's father is a crippled alco holic, a fact which explains Hally's apprehension toward him. The carefree mood of the play is threatened by a series of phone calls from Hally's mother whereby we learn that his father is coming home from the hospital. The bitterness and frustration in this father-to-son relationship sur faces, and Hally is furious with his racist father. Full of self-pity, however, he takes his anger out on Sam in a stream of irrational and devastating behavior, and the rainy afternoon climaxes into a threaten ing storm. As Sam tries to reason with and comfort the boy, Hally bursts into an unstoppable wrath in which he humiliates the black man he loves by mocking their years of friendship and finally, by spitting in his face. The storm is brought to an end when the boy insists that his black servant call him ""Master Harold."" Contemplating the intensity of what has happened, we learn to not only respect others, but our selves. It is Hally's self-hatred that leads him toward irrational acts, not only toward his parents, but most significantly, toward Sam. Overall, the play was re markable as it provided entertain ment as well as strong statements on cultural and social values. Mr. Fugard deliberately doesn't pro vide an ending to the shocking story, which leaves the audience to provide their own after Hally walks out of the tea-room. The reality and degree of racial tensions during that era are obvious in this play. Conse quently, today's modern society should continue to reflect on that time, learn from its previous mis takes, and attend to it's current problems."
Native Americans dance in Williamsport,"By Brian Bastress The American Indian Dance Theatre, representing some 19 dif ferent tribes, reaching from the Dakotas to the Southwest and from Canada to the Great Plains, per formed at the Capitol Theatre in Williamsport last Saturday. It is this country's first national com pany of American Indian dancers and has proven itself a success while touring in the United States as well as in France, Italy, Scot land, Japan, the Persian Gulf states, and North Africa. Nominated for a 1990 Grammy Award nomination and featured in a television special en titled Great Performances: Dance in America, the company has pre served the authenticity of its cer emonial, seasonal, spiritual, and social dances with the enhancement of theatrical staging and lighting. The costumes, ranging from layers of beads and feathers to simple buckskins and leggings, are made by the performers or their families. Each of the dancers and singers brings his or her own style to the production, but by working together, they have created a company that shares the rich heritage of its people with others. Assistant Professor of Reli gion Mary Evelyn Tucker, who at tended the show, was impressed by how the authentic and traditional dancing and singing of the Indians ""has been preserved in the face of such awesome odds of poverty and unemployment"". John Grim, also of the religion department, critiqued the perfor mance as a ""subtle interweaving of social dance and pow-wow dance"" but emphasized that, even though the Indian dancing is very beautiful to watch, the audience should not lose sight of the pressures they face such as treaty rights, loss of land, and efforts to find their sovereign voice. Sue Basalla '92, who spent her Jan Plan on an Indian reserva tion and did not experience any dance of this sort said, ""I felt for tunate to see the kind of ceremony that is private and sacred to the In dians."" The unique performance concluded with a standing ovation from the audience, a true indication of the American Indian Dance Theatre's success and their ability to powerfully display the culture of the Native Americans."

Wood If ever there was a lock, a sureshot, a staple, a given for a record label, it is surely a new Sting album. One can scarcely think of an artist who has put forth music with greater consistency, from his years as the focal point of the Police, through his solo efforts. The Soul Cages is Sting's third solo album, and it comes an eye-raising four years after Nothing Like the Sun. The layoff, Sting says, was the result of a writer's block of sorts during which he nearly panicked. Having obvi ously collected himself, he went to work with some familiar faces, namely Branford Marsalis and Kenny Kirkland, and pieced together The Soul Cages, an album which shows flashes of brilliance but never quite fullfills the level of anticipation that accumulated during his hiatus. If any one thing seems glar ingly absent from this work it is the alacrity with which Sting usually performs his music. There is noth ing light about this album, and at no point will one hear something like The Dream of Blue Turtles con cluded with a fit of laughter. As a matter of fact, the songs are down right melancholy and reflective. Even the seemingly sprite song ""All This Time"" consumes itself with Sting's loss of his father. But in all fairness to Sting, there truly is no one comparable to him musically. Unlike other widely popular musicians, Sting does not have a multitude of mimics preying on his style. This would be rather easily explained by the fact that Sting's music is entirely too ethereal, refined, and personal to replicate. Although there are undoubtedly more talented voices than Sting's, there are few song writers that can match wits with him. Songs like ""Mad About You,"" ""Why Should I Cry For You"" and ""The Soul Cages"" all affirm Sting's merits not only as a performer, but also as a song writer. Even the more hum-drum tracks, of which there are several, still contain his unique lyrical flavor. It is becoming clear that as Sting grows older, his focus is per haps even more on what he is saying rather than how he is saying it. No longer are the days when cries of Roxanne will be heard. Keep this in mind, and you may find some plea sure in The Soul Cages, a very in troverted collection of songs. Courtesy of A&M Records ( y"

111,"Peter Ho/The Bucknellian Caroline Shantz '91 drives to the bucket in an attempt to spark her team against Lehigh, but Shantz's eight points and three steals were not enough to lead the Bison to victory. By Todd Bianchine Staff Writer The women's basketball team will take on the Fordham Lady Rams today at 3 p.m. in the first round of the inaugural Patriot League Tour nament at the Hart Center on the campus of the College of the Holy Cross. Fordham earned the second seed in the tournament by posting a 9-3 league record, while the Lady Bison took the seventh seed with a dismal 1-11 record. Fordham has beaten Bucknell twice this year, once in January, 80- 65, and 84-72 on February 16. Despite their two losses to Fordham and 1-11 league record, co-captain Julie Bachman GR thinks the Lady Bison have a chance. ""The great thing about the tournament is your season is auto matically erased,"" said Bachman. ""Fordham was probably the best possible draw for us because player for player we match up with them the best I really think we can shock some people."" Bucknell finished the regular season against arch-rival Lafayette on Monday, looking for a litttle mo mentum going into this weekend's tournament. Bachman provided 18 first-half points including a 4 -5 shooting performance from three- point territory to give Bucknell a six point lead, 43-37 at the half. In the first 12 minutes of the second half, however, the Lady Leopards fought back with a 30-10 scoring drive, led by Terri Dadio's 11 points. By the time the dust had settled, Bucknell was behind 73-58. Lafayatte held on to the lead and won the game 88-71. ""We played excellent in the first half,"" said Bachman, ""but we had a total breakdown in the second half. We never seem to be able to put two halves together."" Bucknell's hopes of climbing out the basement slipped further away as they lost their last home game to Lehigh 79-66 last Saturday. The Lady Bison matched the Lady Engineers point for point in the first half, and were led by eight points and three steals from Carloine Shantz '91. However, the Lady Bison's plague of not being able to string two halves together caught up with them once again, as Lehigh scored 17 of the first 21 points in the second half to coast to an easy 79-66 victory. The good news at last Sunday's game was the recognition of four seniors, including two play ers and two scorekeepers. Bachman, one of the honorees and a graduate student who came back to use up her final year of eligibility, led the Lady Bison in scoring this season, averag ing approximately 16 points a game. Also honored was Shantz,."
Skiers qualify for nat'l cham pion,
ships for second straight season,"By Susan E. Smith The Bucknell men's ski team qualified last weekend for the Na tional Collegiate Ski Association (NCSA) National Championships for the second consecutive season after performing flawlessly at the Mid-Atlantic Regional Champion ships in Seven Springs, PA. The NCSA constitutes 92 per cent of all collegiate ski racing, en compassing nearly 240 schools across the nation. The Bison secured their berth by earning first place from a field of twelve schools at regionals Feb. 23 and 24. The races showcased the top four teams from three conferences (Allegheny, New Jersey, and South eastern), proving once again Penn sylvania schools' supremacy in Northeastern NCSA ski racing. Following Bucknell was UPenn and Penn State, who finished second and third respectively, to give the Allegheny Conference a sweep of the three berths awarded for nationals. Two strong schools from the Southeastern Conference, Virginia and Virginia Tech, saw their hopes dashed by having many racers fall in the difficult slalom after skiing well in the previous day's gi ant slalom. The Bison will travel March 11 to Mount Bachelor in Bend, Or egon, for a week of racing against the nation's elite. Last year at Waterville Valley, New Hampshire, Bucknell concluded its season ranked 13th in the country, and the Bison will look to crack the top ten this year on the West Coast. Standouts on the men's team include Allegheny Conference Champion Kevin Gawenus '91, and All-Conference members Rob Thompson '91 and Mark Abra- hamsen '93. J. P. Gallagher '94, Brian Swanson '92, Scott Miller '93, and Scott Pericelli '94 round out the ""A"" team, which exhibited strong depth all season. The Lady Bison, who in 1990 ranked 15th in the nation, were decimated in 1991 by the graduation or transfers of many of last year's key skiers. Moreover, Women's team captain Christine Ralston '92 this month sustained an injury to her anterior cruciate ligament, tearing her knee in the final weekend of races in the regular season. The women's team barely missed qualifying for regionals after placing fifth in the conference dur ing the regular season. Nevertheless, Ralston and Sarah McCahill '93 had outstanding seasons, attaining All- Conference honors. The Lady Bison had three skiers-- Kate Fink '93, Elyse Knut son '93 and Kerry Marks '94-- who experienced racing for the first time in their skiing careers. They provide youth and potential that will keep the women's team competitive for the next several years. Highlights and lowlights were plentiful for the successful club sport this season. Practice opened in upper New England this year with a train ing week in the biting cold and wind at Smuggler's Notch, Vermont. The trip was beneficial to many, as first-year racer Fink attrib-"

""It really made the difference in my racing,"" said Fink. ""All the indi vidual attention I received from the instructors was a great help. They taught me the proper timing and edging for my turns."" Fink added, ""Running the gates every day against our main ri vals, UPenn [who were also training in Vermont], gave us an edge during the regular season. Another turning point of the year was the addition of Thompson, who returned from a January teach ing internship halfway through the season. The conference's number- five skier sent a message to the rest of the league immediately by win ning his first race at Eagle Rock, PA, after returning from his month-long hiatus. That race also rewrote the Bucknell history books, as Thomp son, Gawenus, and Abrahamsen finished one-two-three in a field of over sixty racers, marking the first time Bucknell has placed the top three skiers in an event. The ""Road to Oregon"" wasn't without some bumpy rides however. On the way to practice three weeks ago, the ski team's University- owned van skidded, rolled off the road, and ultimately ran into a tree because of the inclement weather. Miraculously, injuries were very minor, and the team was undaunted, as it stayed focused for the crucial regional races. The College of Idaho won last year's national championship, but this season it appears that Western State College (Colo.) is the team to beat It placed second in 1990. Bucknell's ski team is cur rently meeting with many University organizations in order to raise fund ing for many financial obligations, including air fare, lodging, and reg istration fees. Gawenus noted, ""Making na tionals was something that we had been aiming at all season. Now maybe Bucknell will take this club sport seriously. Right now, however, we're having trouble getting them [the University] to help pay for our trip."" If the Universisty can finance the trip, it will provide a once-in-a- lifetime opportunity for many of these athletes. who came on strong in the latter half of the season with solid backcourt play. She leaves Bucknell placed fifth on the all-time assists list. Others recognized at the game were seniors Jenny Clark and Kathy Schulte for their services to the team. ""It was a neat experience playing a college sport,"" said Shantz, ""and I'm really glad I got a chance to do it It was great playing with Julie, and I think we tried our best"""

Grapplers win two,"By Jamie Diaferia Staff Writer The Bison grapplers continued to show signs of dramatic improve ment last weekend by defeating Central Connecticut and Hofstra University. The victories are com ing at a key point in the season for Bucknell (8-8), as the East Coast Wrestling Association (ECWA) championships draw closer, and the team's confidence level is at it's highest point to date. The team headed to Central Connecticut on Friday, where the Bison scraped out a 23-19 victory over the perennially tough confer ence team. Previously, coach Bob Ferraro had said that the Bison would have to do everything right to defeat Central Connecticut. His prophecy proved true as the Bison needed some key wins to pull off the upset. Phil Elliot '93 wrestling to a 4-4 draw was, according to Ferraro, an ""extremely important point in the victory."" The key win, however, be longed to Mike Van Doren '92, who was wrestling at 150 lbs. when he defeated his opponent 13-0. The victory sparked the Bison and, ac cording to Ferraro, ""put the team back on track."" One of the unfortunate mo ments for the Bison occurred when Chris Ducas '91 (126 lbs.), was pinned by his opponent after leading for most of the match. Ferraro, however, believes that the winner of that match will be the number one ranked wrestler in the conference. The Bison then headed to Hofstra, where they trounced their overmatched opponent, 37-8. Ferraro had remarked that Hofstra did not have the balance that Central Connecticut did, and this clearly contributed to their downfall. The victory was characterized by a consistent effort on the part of the entire Bison team. Winners for the Bison included Ducas, Elliot, Van Doren, Mike Salone '92, and Tom Marchetti '91. A draw was credited to heavyweight Ben Myers '91 as well. The two matches over the weekend may prove to be the driving force that will propel the team to an ECWA championship. Ferraro was pleased with the Bison performance because, in effect, the victories could not have been written any better. ""We did what we had to do to win."" Bucknell's ability to accom plish this in the future may be the deciding factor when the ECWA's arrive. It is then that the Bison will be forced to face their fiercest rival, Rider College. According to Ferraro, in order to beat them, ""the other teams will have to beat out some of their guys."" While the victories over the weekend may provide the catalyst for the streaking Bison team, Ferraro would like to think the road trip to California earlier in the year made the difference. ""There is no question in my mind that the difficulty of our non-conference schedule prepared us for the rest of the season."" While many were quick to criticize the Bison for their 4-8 record after the trip, Ferraro's an swer comes in the form of the Bison late season surge. ""We will continue to wrestle tough non-conference teams at the start of the season. We are without a doubt ready for the championships."" The Bison grapplers appear to be finishing strong and riding on a wave of confidence based on their weekend victories. With the ECWA's directly around the comer and the prospects of facing Rider fairly high, the Bison will once again need to make all the right moves to finish the season strong. / / page 14 The Bucknellian March 1, 1991"

The Rams knocked off the Bison in their two meetings ear lier this season, by six points each time. ""Coming into this tournament we had hoped to get another crack at them,"" commented Woollum at the post-game conference. Courtney went on to add, ""This game was a good test before Fordham because Army is a very good defensive team."" Bucknell split its final two regular season games played earlier this week. Last Saturday, Lehigh handed the Bison their fifth conference loss 98-87 in front of a standing-room- only crowd in Davis Gym. The win was the Engineers' fifth straight against Bucknell. Malik Malone '91, Keith Fenton '91, and Leshinski combinded for 30 points on their se nior night. The final regular season game was a record setting one for Courtney as Bucknell came from behind to defeat Lafayette on the road 66-62. Courtney's game-high 28 points broke Gregg Leggett's '90 single season scoring record of 585. He also tied Mike Joseph's '90 and Leggett's record of 16 twenty-point games in a single season.

H o c k e y  finishes frustrating,
y e a r w ith o u t p la y o ff berth,"By Jen Walsh Staff Writer After a long, frustrating sea son of mishaps, what the Bucknell ice hockey team really needed, was to play one last game. One last game where it could pound the other team intq the boards and run up the score. But what the Bison hockey team lacked last Sunday was a team to play against. It was somehow ironic-- or perhaps very fitting-- that Bucknell should win its last game by forfeit over Georgetown, which could not get enough players together to field a team. That also became a chronic problem for the Bucknell hockey team in the middle of its season and grew worse as the year wore on. The Bison skaters finished the year with a respectable record of eight wins and six losses, but failed to make the playoffs for the second straight year. This time, however, the idea of not participating in the post-season must be particularly painful. It is one thing to miss the playoffs because you have a lousy team; it is another to miss them be cause of lousy circumstances. Bucknell finished the month of January with a record of 5-1, but lost five of its next eight games in the month of February. The losses were almost entirely due to Bucknell players not being able to show up for games, rather than a lack of ability to score or defend. The team was talented enough, having just the right blend of goal-scorers, playmakers, and strong defense-- even a bit of speed and toughness, but none of that made any difference when enough players did not show. ""It was definitely an interest ing season,"" said co-captain John Guelcher '91. ""It was so up and down. Some games were great, some games were frustrating. I guess most of all it was a season of frustration."" But surely the most frustrating aspect of the year for the hockey team had to be the game they lost to Gettysburg just over a week ago, during which Buckncll almost won, with less than seven skaters on its team. It turned out that, had the team been able to win that game, the Bi son would have made the playoffs and had their shot at the champion ship. However, it was not to be, and so for now all the hockey team can do is look to the future. ""Next year there should be a much better team than this year,"" said Guelcher. ""We're only losing three or four really good people, and we should have another good fresh man class-- they seem to get stron ger every year."" Co-captain Carl Zuckerberg '91 called it ""a fun season"", and pointed out that events such as rush, which will be held in the fall next year, won't interfere with the schedule again. The players also ac knowledged their appreciation for the fan support over the season, and conclude by saying that they are ""still committed."""
Women swimmers return from,
Easterns after decent showing,"By Mitch Benton Staff Writer Four members of the women's swimming and diving team com peted at the Eastern Intercollegiate Swimming and Diving Champion ships last weekend at Princeton University. The invitational meet, which brings together top swimmers who have met qualifying times dur ing the season, was won convinc ingly by Harvard University with 558 points, followed by Penn State with 527, and host Princeton with 473. The Bison foursome, whose teammates did not score at last year's event, placed 19th in the field of 34, with a total 41 points. The outstanding swimmer of the meet was Lisa Flood of sixth-place Villanaova, while the high scorer of the competition was Princeton's Nathalie Wunderlich. Bucknell's scoring was led by sophomore Margaret Grunow, who captured fourteen points for her tenth-place finishes in both the 50- and 100-yard freestyles. Grunow's time in the 50 free, 24.05, broke her own Bucknell all-time record,while her finish in the 100 free barely missed another school record. Other points won for the Bison came from the relay teams. The 200- yard freestyle relay team of Grunow, Kathaleen Hartnett '94, Kelly Appier '91, and Andrea Falcione '92 finished eleventh in the competition. Their time of 1:38.32 was just 42 hundredths slower then the school record set by the same foursome at the Patriot League Championships, held earlier this month. Other scoring relays for the team were the 400 and 200-yard medley relay teams, which finished thirteenth in both events and swam slightly slower then the school records that were also set at the championships. The excitement of the perfor mances turned in by these swimmers was echoed by the co-captain, Appier. ""We were all really happy with our times, especially in the re lays. Even though we didn't set any records, the [time] splits were great."" The Men's Eastern Intercollegiate Championships will be held this weekend, also at Princeton. Bucknell's men's squad will look to better its 20th place fin ish at last year's event. Don Steenson '92, unbeaten this year in the 200 yard backstroke, and Jay Gross '93, who won league titles in the 50-yard freestyle and the 200-yard back- stroke, will be competing for the Bison. r << itt t ."

Bison dominate track championships,
"Men win their tenth straight indoor title while the women place second, just 18 points behind Fordham","By Chris Drowne Staff Writer Despite popular opinion, the phrase, ""the more things change, the more they stay the same,"" can be applied to indoor track and field. The league, field houses, and most of the opponents are different, but the result is the same. Bucknell's men won the inaugural Patriot League Indoor Track and Field Championships at the Sanford Field House at Colgate University last weekend. The Lady Bison finished a close second, only 18 points back. Bucknellian File Photo The men's indoor track and field won their tenth straight league championship last weekend at Colgate University. Bucknell domi nated all aspects of the meet, beating second-place Fordam by 88 points. Before the two-day event was over, 18 field house records were broken. Seven of the records were broken by Bison runners. Eight first-place finishes and numerous other point-earning per formances in 17 events carried the Bison men to their tenth straight in door title (the previous nine coming as a member of the East Coast Con ference). Only Fordham, who won the women's title, offered the men token pressure. The opening field events en abled both the men's and women's teams to separate themselves from the lesser talented squads. ""We set the tone early."" said Head Coach Art Gulden. Paul Austin '91 captured both the 35-pound weight and shot put competitions with ease, setting a school record of 57' 2.5"" in weight. Scott Croasdale '93 and Pete Gre gory '93 also scored in those events.

Volleyball begins inaugural,
season by winning five of six,"By Mike Lutz and Rob Winchell The Bucknell men's volley ball team has started off their first season with a convincing record of 4-1 in the league and 5-1 overall. This past weekend, under the leadership of newly acquired coach Ann Marie Larese, the team traveled to Susquehanna University, where the Bison scored convincing wins over Susquehanna and an overcon fident Bloomsburg University team. Competing at home on Sun day, the team was not as fortunate, however, defeating Shippensburg University B in three straight games but falling to a powerful Shippensburg A team in four games. Last Sunday's game was the club's first home match in history and was attended by a small but en thusiastic crowd of fans. While the B team easily defeated Shippens burg, the Bison A team was plagued with inconsistent play in their defeat to the team from Shippensburg. After losing the first game 13-15, the Bison rebounded to dominate the second game 15-6. Bucknell then fell victim to sloppy play in the final two games as Shippensburg went on to win the match three games to one. ""A lot of us were tired from our two tough matches on Saturday,"" commented Ben Jarosz '94. ""We were on a high after coming from behind and beating Bloomsburg, and we just sort of let down."" The day before, the squad faced a relatively weak team from Susquehanna in its first match. Playing a best-of-three format, the Bison cruised to easy 15-6 and 15-5 victories. The Bison were faced with a tough Bloomsburg team in the sec ond match of the day, however, and lost the first game of the match 5- 15. Bloomsburg soon lost its com posure in the face of an undaunted Bucknell squad though, and the Bi- son pummeled their opponents in the next two games, 15-4 and 15-5. The key to the turn-around, according to Mike Lutz '94, was that ""we just didn't give up. The coach made a key substitution, we were able to turn things around, and then we never looked back."" This is the team's first year in the Eastern Intercollegiate Volley ball Association (EIVA), which in cludes teams from all along the east coast. The present organization was founded last year by Brad Wealand '93 and Paul Ridder '93, and has grown considerably. Still in the building stages, the team has already figured to be a powerhouse in central Pennsylvania.

The women took first in the 55- meter dash and hurdles and in the 200-meter dash. Norbert Berenyi '91 led the always dominant distance runners with top finishes in the mile and 800- meter races. His victory in the mile was exciting as he came-ffom-behind to win in an outstanding field. Jeff Loomis '92 and Tom Eagleson '93 kept pace with Berenyi in the mile, finishing second and fourth, respec tively. Dave Slupe '93 grabbed bronze in the 800. Jason Cahilly '92 won the Gold metal in the 5000-meter in a record time of 14:54.24 as team mates Bob Kelly '92, David Howard '93 and Todd Vincent '92 took three of the next five slots. The 3000-meter was also packed with Bison as Matt Deardorff '92, Tom Wuchenich '92 and Judd Jordan '93 crossed the finish line 1- 3-5. Jim Bock '92 sprinted to vic tory in the 55-meter dash with Henry Ramsey '92 taking fourth. The women also picked up a first in the 55-meter dash courtesy of junior Tricia Plasko's ECAC quali fying time of 7.33. McBride finished second, just .02 seconds back. Plasko also won the 200-meter dash in 25.80 seconds which set an other Bucknell record. Dana Harbst '93, Audra Wilson '94, and Julie Diercks *93 took places four through six, respectively. The 55-meter hurdles title went to Karen Shimomura '91, whose time of 8:41 also qualified her forECAC's. Carla DeBiasi '94 also scored in the event with her fifth- place finish. While the men didn't win the 55-meter hurdles competition, they did manage to dominate it. Jean Simon '94, Mark Barolo '93, Fawcett and Tri-Captain Paul Houchens '91 captured second through fifth places, respectively.

The Lady Bison also received points from distance runners Kristin Opdyke '93 in the 3000-meter, Kelly Marsh '91 and Helene Weiting '91 in the 5000-meter, and Gina Abraham '93 in the 1000-meter. In the relay events, both dis tance medley teams finished third. The men's 4x400 and 4x800-meter squads also finished third while the women picked up silver metals in both. ""I was really pleased with both teams. We came ready. Our kids work harder than everyone else. Their work ethic in day to day prac tice showed. There were no disap pointments, "" added Gulden. The men's team is ready to bring its dominance outside. The women's squad may be just a few good throwers away from surpassing Fordham for a title.

Alumni return to Davis Gym,
Stars from yesteryear return for second annual game,"By Brad Tufts Despite frequent admonitions that the past is behind us, Bucknell basketball fans were given a glimpse of years gone by when the Second Annual Bison Basketball Alumni Game was played last Saturday af ternoon. Five of the school's 18 1,000- point career scorers took part in the game and the fans were treated to a wide open affair that ended in a 111 - 99 victory for the White team over the Blue team. Leading the way for the vic tors was Mike Joseph '90, who picked up where he left off last sea son by hitting six of seven shots from three-point range on his way to scoring a game-high 30 points. The two-time All-ECC guard also hit all four of his free throws, and most observers wouldn't be surprised if he doesn't miss a free throw until well into the next century. Bob Bany '80, also a two-time All-ECC selection, registered the optician's special with 20 points and 20 rebounds and played the first game witnessed by his four-month- old son, Bobby, who already looks like he'll be formidable in the pivot for the 2009-10 Bison. Also in double figures for the White, who shot a creditable 48 percent from the field, were Gerald Purnell '78, who was the first Bison junior ever to hit 1,000 points, with 11 points, and Harvey Edwards '78, John Callaway '78, and Roger Clark '78 each had ten points. Ed Sigl '84 had eight points, 14 boards and five intimidating blocked shots. Jack Webber '52, easily the oldest player, didn't score but was a favorite with Colin Bridgewater/The Bucknellian Ted Aceto '89 attempts a jump shot as Mike Joseph '90 looks on. Joseph led his White team to a 111-99 win with 30 points.

Students in AIDS high-risk groups are encouraged to be tested. support the test, which will deter mine whether a person has con tracted the HIV virus. ""There are a lot of advantages to knowing whether you're positive,"" said Preston Hoyle, director of Student Medical Services. The tests will be given by two individuals who work at AIDS test ing clinics and who have provided the same services to area universities such as Susquehanna and Bloomsburg. Rick Schultz, a public health program representative from Williamsport, and Judith Polites, a community health nurse and AIDS prevention program coordinator from Danville, will administer the test independent of the University's medical center. As part of the program, Schultz and Polites will very likely provide counseling, according to Hoyle, who had not actually dis cussed the matter with them. ""I'm assuming they are probably going to do some pre- and post-test counsel ing,"" he said. Molly Swart '92, the repre sentative of I^LAG who initially discussed the testing with Hoyle, also expects the program to include counseling. ""I know these people will come back to give the results,"" she said, suggesting that some coun seling will take place then. The test will be completely anonymous and confidential. Al though no definite procedure for carrying out the test has been deter mined, the testing will be run through the Student Medical Center.

Employment prospects decline,"By Travis Elliott Staff Writer Bucknell seniors are encoun tering more difficulty than usual finding jobs this year due to corpo- rate cutbacks in the face of reces sion. Corporate recruiters have cancelled 45 to 50 on-campus job interview sessions so far this aca demic year, up from the average 30 to 35 cancellation, according to the . Director of the Career Develop ment Center, Mark Kerr. Kerr said, 'The job market is indeed down this year. Many em ployers can't make a commitment to as many people. We are in a de pressed market as it relates to job cautiously optimistic."" According to the Collegiate Employment Research Institute at Michigan State University, employ ers will hire 9.8 percent fewer new college graduates this spring as compared with a year ago. Kerr explained that in the past, most companies have cancelled their on-campus recruiting sessions be cause they didn't have students who were interested, but many are now cancelling because they don't have the opportunities to offer. Julie Shurilla '91 has been searching for a job with magazine publishing companies, but as of yet, she has been unable to secure an in terview. She said, ""Many of the bigger magazines have had a hiring freeze since last fall, but hopefully things will start looking up soon."" John Kraus '91, a Political Science/English double major who has been actively pursuing a career in the management field, said that out of 25 resumes, he had received only a few responses--most nega tive. He also said that many re sponses required interviewing at a company's branch office and not on campus. Kere noted that a number of corporations are trying to condense the interviewing process and re duce some of the expenses nor mally related with second inter views, such as travel expenses.

Faculty rejects motion,
to sever ties with ROTC,"By Mark Leister Staff Writer In a 70-30 secret ballot vote, the faculty decided on Monday to retain Bucknell's Army Reserve Officer Training Corps. While re jecting the initial motion to abolish the program, the faculty instead passed an alternative motion calling for Bucknell to begin formal lobby ing against the Department of Defense's discriminatory policies. The faculty's majority vote defeated last month's motion intro duced by George Jenks, collection development librarian. Jenks called for the complete severing of ties with the ROTC program on grounds that its policies are discriminatory and its curriculum ""teaches the art of kill ing."" Prior to the vote, three faculty members read prepared statements in opposition to the motion. Marg aret Kastner, associate professor of chemistry, was the first to express her dissent. She encouraged the re tention of ROTC stating that ""if we are to encourage diversity at Buck nell, we should encourage programs .and activities that add to that diver sity and continue our educational goals."" Dick Henry, professor of physics, was similarly dissatisfied with Jenks' motion. Henry stated that the removal of ROTC would be ""antithetical to the philosophy of a liberal education."" A motion for a secret ballot vote was then accepted and the votes were tallied. Of the 100 faculty members who chose to vote, nearly three-quarters sided against severing ties with the ROTC program. Immediately following the defeat of Jenks' motion, Nancy Caine, associate professor of psy chology and a representative of the Feminist Women's Caucus, intro duced an alternative four-element motion to the faculty. The FWC first moved that Bucknell join national educational groups in lobbying for changes in Department of Defense policies which discriminate against homo sexuals and bisexuals; second, that the University explore ways to for mally protest the Armed Forces' discrimination of women; and third, See ROTC, page 2 Colin Bridgewater/The Bucknellian George Jenks had his motion to sever ties with the ROTC program rejected at Monday's faculty meeting by a secret ballot vote of 70-30."

ROTC,"From page 1 that all Bucknell literature include a disclaimer that ROTC contradicts the University's nondiscriminatory policy. The faculty then amended the fourth section to state that Bucknell should disassociate itself from ROTC if the Department of Defense does not eliminate its discriminatory policy within three years. After a short debate, however, the faculty decided in a S7-30 vote that the fourth element should be eliminated altogether and the amended, three-section motion was passed. In response to the removal of the disassociation clause, Caine stated that the motion's authors ""knew it was the most controversial"" part but they felt that ""it made the motion a stronger one."" Despite his belief that the mo tion was ""gutted"" by the disassocia tion clause's removal, Jenks said he voted for the second motion. Con cerning the defeat of his earlier mo tion, however, he remained optimis tic. ""I didn't expect the motion to pass; it came out better than I thought it would be."" After the meeting, President Gary Sojka said he ""was not un happy"" with the faculty's decision to pass the second motion. ""I was told to do what I would anyway -- lobby to change Department of Defense policies which are blatantly dis criminatory."""
Employment,"From page 1 said, ""To save expense and time, many employers will be performing second interviews on-campus during their second day on campus."" Kraus explained that out of 3 on-campus interviews, he had still received no offers. Kerr also explained that many companies want to see what happens in the first quarter of 1991 after the Persian Gulf crisis. He noted, how ever, that some fields continue to do well. Engineering, computer-related jobs, and accounting have not done as poorly as other fields. He said, ""I believe the reces sion won't continue into the long term. By next fall or next spring, the job situation should improve and hopefully we will have a fuller re cruiting schedule."""

AIDS testing,"From page 1 Hoyle said, speculating as to the ar rangements. Hoyle emphasized that al though the test will be administered at the medical center, the results will remain confidential. ""[The students] will present themselves and be di rected back to the area where they'll do the testing. That will be it as far as we're concerned. There will be no notations on their health records; they will not be identified as having been in,"" he said. The test, Hoyle speculated, will be a standard blood test Blood samples will be sent to a commercial lab, which will examine them using the ELISA test. Hoyle pointed out that in any medical test, the possibility of a false reading exists. He said, however, only the ""state of the art"" tests will be used. Any sample testing positive for the HIV virus will be subjected to the Western blot test, a common procedure in AIDS testing. Aside from simple curiosity, an individual may want to be tested for the AIDS virus for several rea sons. Hoyle said that early detection may be a key. ""Taking medication seems to delay the onset of full blown AIDS,"" he said, referring to AZT, the drug which often prolongs the lives of people who have con tracted the virus. Detecting the disease in its early stages then ""makes testing a more valuable thing. It has some positive things like finding out you can begin some medication that will delay the onset of the illness,"" Hoyle said. Although several campus or ganizations support the testing, Swart said that FLAG will try to down-play its involvement in an at tempt to attract more students to the test. ""We want people to know [the testing] is not just for homosexuals. It's for anybody who is in a high risk category for catching AIDS,"" Swart continued."
Correction:,"Two names were accidentally omitted from Phi Gamma Delta's 1991 pledge list in an article entitled ""Fraternities announce new 1991 pledges,"" which ran in the March 1 issue of The Bucknellian. The list of pledges should have included Scott Snider '94 and Matthew Sniegocki '93, bringing Phi Gamma Delta's total number of pledges to 38."

Incidents of retail theft,
increase at bookstore,"By Bob Ritter StaffWriter A Bucknell student was charged with retail theft by East Buffalo Township Police last month after switching price tags on mer chandise in the University Book store. The incident highlights a re cent increase in retail theft on the Bookstore, according to Robert Gramley, East Buffalo Township police chief. Vince DeCerchio, di rector of security and safety, also called retail theft ""a serious prob lem."" According to police and secu rity reports, one student was charged with retail theft following an inci dent on February 26. The student picked up a specially-ordered book, priced at $51.50 at the textbook of fice and then proceeded to the text book area, where he was seen hold ing a used Education book. When a Bookstore employee went to see if he needed assistance, he left the textbook section of the store and entered the stationary and supplies area. After the student went through the checkout, employees examined his receipt and found that the only textbook charged was a used text for $24.25, the same price as the Education book he was seen holding. Investigation also revealed one of the copies of the Education book on the shelf did not ha ve a price tag. The student later admitted to the summary offense, which can carTy a fine of up to $300, as well as restitution. The case has not yet reached District Justice Leo Armbruster. Gramley said the arrest of the student ""was the biggest [arrest] we've had in quite a while."" DeCerchio admitted that ""there is a lot of petty theft"" in the bookstore, with many of the inci dents involving merchandise priced"

Lack of parking creates,
problems for students,"By Marjorie Stinchcombe Having trouble finding a parking space? If the answer is yes, you are not alone. There seem to be too many cars and too few spaces. One student, Rachel Gusset '93, says, ""I have a lot of trouble finding a parking spot. Usually it is just easier to walk."" Her sentiment is echoed by many. Other frequent complaints are that even with a parking sticker, it is impossible to find a convenient parking space. The result is that many students are park ing illegally, and they are being ticketed even though they have paid $25 to register their car. What is the University reac tion to the parking crunch? Accord ing to Richard McGinnis, chairman of the parking committee, ""There are enough parking spaces on campus to accommodate all the cars, but not all spaces are equally used."" For in stance, the parking lot by the sta dium is rarely full.. McGinnis notes that there has been an increase in the number of cars registered, but there is also a new lot by the Lambda Chi Alpha house. Furthermore, he believes that the parking problem will increase in severity over the next few years when an increased number of staff and students bring cars to campus. There is no quota, however, on the number of parking stickers issued. Alternative plans such as a lottery for stickers, have been deemed unfair. McGinnis realizes that many students need to have a car on campus for job or travel purposes. But the University is not planning on building any more parking lots. With regard to complaints about fines, McGinnis says, ""We did a survey three years ago, and we found in or der for the fine to be effective, it must be at least ten dollars. Anything less that did not deter students."" There is also currently a process by which students can appeal what they feel is an unfair ticket. There do not seem to be any quick and easy solutions to students' parking woes. Security is currently trying to crack down on freshmen with cars on campus. Besides stricter enforcement, however, there is little to be done about the parking di lemma. Not every student will be able to find a convenient parking space, and this dilemma undoubt edly diminishes the value of having a car on campus for some students. McGinnis advises students to walk to class and the library, and to try to park in under-used parking lots such as the Stadium lot. There is no solution to the parking dilemma, but it seems that students may have to realize as one Bucknell official said, ""We don't have a parking problem, we have a walking problem."""
State law requires University,
to follow recycling regulations,"under one dollar. ""People seem to think it's OK,"" DeCerchio said, ""they don't regard that kind of petty theft as a crime. The problem is they fail to realize that shrinkage [retail and internal theft] has been known to actually close or bankrupt some large stores."" According to DeCerchio, there were 31 incidents during the last four months which involved shoplifting or ""product tampering,"" opening or eating merchandise, or moving it to another area with intent to remove it from the store. DeCerchio noted that many were items of low value. Of the ten incidents in December, he ex plained, ""most of these were be tween five and fifty dollars,"" and that the two arrests in November were for a theft of thirteen dollars and under one dollar. With these figures, DeCerchio also said, ""I suspect we're only catching ten percent"" of all thefts. DeCerchio also explained that Pennsylvania law dictates that ""all shoplifters are arrested, finger printed and prosecuted,"" regardless of the value of the theft. He said that the law helps find repeat offenders, by ensuring that their past shoplift ing incidents will be documented. Gramley explained that retail theft is a summary offense for a first of fense, but that it becomes a misdemeanor if a national check re veals prior shoplifting convictions. DeCerchio said ""we're look ing at a number of different things"" to combat the problem, including ""increased surveillance, stricter in ventory procedures or an education program for the Bucknell commu nity"" about the hidden cost of shop lifting which ""everybody pays."" He noted that ""we haven't looked at any stronger measures, in part because of the University belief ""that we should be investing our energies in trusting people."" By Timothy W. Kirk Bucknell University is now engaged in the final stages of a four- phased recycling program to comply with Pennsylvania Act 101. Recy cling coordinator Penny Puskarich '92 warns we are in a critical phase of the recycling program, and that the University has been given a mandate to comply with all state regulations by September, 1991. Establishing guidelines for cities, towns, and local municipali ties, the Municipal Waste Planning, Recycling, and Waste Reduction Act of 1988 also requires programs for ""schools, school districts, and insti tutions of higher learning."" Accord ing to Puskarich, Bucknell's pro gram will be in full compliance with the act by September. The school has been following the four-phased plan, designed by Puskarich, since spring, 1990. Be ginning with the education and par ticipation of University administra tion, faculty, and support staff, the plan sought to construct a firm base from which recycling awareness would permeate throughout the en tire campus. Curriculum pertaining to recycling and environmental awareness was incorporated into this past summer's training program for Resident Assistants, the Freshmen Orientation program, and various other student service programs. Placement of recycling receptacles and bins around campus completed the second phase. This semester marks the be ginning of the third and most ag gressive phase of the plan. By the end of Spring semester all residence, office, classroom, laboratory, and athletic facilities will be equipped with recycling receptacles and will be serviced by separate collection of recyclable materials. Fraternities have been instructed to submitrecy cling proposals and to begin imple mentation of approved programs immediately. Representatives from all student and University organiza tions will be briefed on requirements and asked to aid in educating their peers. September 26 marks the date Act 101 goes into effect and Puskarich predicts Bucknell will be operating a program which is ""leaps and bounds ahead"" of other local communities. While many commu nities, including Lewisburg, recycle only four products, Bucknell's pro gram is much more comprehensive. ""We are recycling seven products, including leaf waste,"" notes Puskarich. She attributes the mag nitude of the operation of Bucknell's Grounds Supervisor, George Trutt. ""George said if we're going to re cycle, we should do it right and re cycle all the materials. I agree with him."" Recycling plastics, glass, alu minum, newspaper, desk paper, cor rugated cardboard, and leaf waste constitutes an extremely complex and costly operation, admits Puskarich, but she also points to present waste disposal costs. The cost of dumping waste into the Lycoming landfill, Bucknell's present method of disposal, has tripled since 1988, and the life span of the fill is diminishing rapidly. According to figures presented by the physical plant, the cost of dumping in 1989 exceeded $70,000. While the cost of recycling does presently outweigh the money re ceived for materials, if Bucknell in creases the amount of recycled ma terial, recycling would pay for itself. Puskarich points to the projected decreased cost of dumping if more materials are recycled in combina tion with the money received for these materials as factors in balanc ing the cost and increasing effi ciency. These figures reveal, she stresses, the importance of ""every one doing their part"" as an issue of economic importance as well as of environmental concern. Bucknell's program depends not only on universal participation, but continual update and education as well. Puskarich notes that in a university community there is a 25% population turnover annually, which necessitates ongoing programs to effectively integrate incoming freshmen into the program. The pro gram calls for ""constant investiga tion into markets and requirements"

Bush announces,
return of troops,"President Bush announced Wednesday an immediate return of American troops from the Persian Gulf. He has pledged, also, to maintain a forceful diplomatic pres ence in the Middle East in order to resolve Arab-Israeli conflicts. Bush emphasized the long standing American policy that Israel, in order to attain peace and to secure borders, must trade the territory it seized in Arab-Israeli wars. Bush's statement may be read by Israel's Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir as an attempt to force Israel concede ter ritory to the Palestinians. Troops which had been sta tioned in the Persian Gulf will be sent home, following the end of fighting which came last week in the Persian Gulf. Since then Iraqi Presi dent Saddam Hussein has consented to give up his annexation of the small emirate, and has agreed to pay back all of Kuwait's assets. This action was taken on the insistence of the United Nations, and has seemingly resulted in a perma nent cease fire between Iraq and the allied forces. However, the freed Kuwait City remains a scene of devastation; the field which holds 684 out of Kuwait's 950 oil wells were set ablaze by Iraq a week before ground war began. Officials have said that it will be at least two years before most of the fire is extinguished."
Russians support,
Baltic freedom,"An increasing number of indi viduals from the Baltic republics have demonstrated a desire for inde pendence. Even persons of Russian nationality living in the Baltic region have supported the movement to ward independence, despite heavy lobbying by the Kremlin to retain their support.

Russians and other non- Latvians made up the balance of the vote. The Kremlin had anticipated that advisory polls would indicate support for independence by Latvian and Estonian voters, but it has need for concern over the unexpected re sults from Russian voters. The advi sory polls are a precursor to Presi dent Mikail Gorbachev's national referendum, scheduled for Mar. 17, on preserving the union."
Anti-apartheid,
group disbands,"As a result of the political changes in South Africa, the United Democratic Front, a coalition of anti-apartheid groups formed over seven years ago, has announced that it will soon disband. The Front worked as a domestic surrogate for the African National Congress in the period during which it was banned. But Feb. 2, 1990 marked the legal ization of the Congress, and mem bers of the Front say the coalition has now fulfilled its role. ""We feel that the purpose for which we were set up has been achieved,"" said Patrick Lckota, elected publicity secretary when the organization was founded in 1983. The Front's executive com mittee has suggested that members support the Congress. Some have proposed that the coalition continue as a counter-weight to the Congress. The executive committee issued a proposal Monday that individuals from the Front work within the structure of the Congress. The United Democratic Front will dissolve on Aug. 20, exactly eight years after its founding."
FBI investigates,
cyanide-lacing,"Another wave of cyanide poi soning has left two people dead and one seriously injured, and federal officials warn people not to become too complacent about possible tam pering of over-the-counter drugs. On Tuesday, the Federal Bureau of In vestigation took over the probing of recent tampering cases. In February, two people, both from Washington, died after taking Sudafed 12-hour decongestant cap sules which had been laced with cyanide. One other is still recovering from the poisoning, which also re sulted from cyanide-laced Sudafed capsules. The makers of Sudafed waited to order a nationwide recall of the drug until Sunday, when autopsy reports, laboratory results, and in terviews provided enough evidence to link the incidents to tampering. One box recalled did appear to have been tampered with. Federal au thorities are examining the box in a Washington, D.C. laboratory."
Asbestos cases,

A committee of federal judges, appointed by Chief Justice William Reinquist, has urged Con gress to devise a ""national solution"" to the increase in lawsuits, delays in settlement and depletion of funds normally available for victims' funds which now pay for legal fees.

York expels six,
for hazing,"Six fraternity members at York College face expulsion for charges in hazing incidents. The members of Kappa Psi Epsilon face stiff disciplinary action for allegedly forcing pledges to skin squirrels and drink water from a toilet bowl. One student will not be al lowed to return to school next se mester; five others face expulsion as well. Joseph Merkle, dean of student affairs, and the Greek Judicial Board, comprised of students, de termined the punishment. In addition to the expulsions, each fraternity member will have to perform 10 hours of community service. Fraternity members will ap peal the decision. According to Merkle, state law prohibits any activity which might be degrading to an individual or which affects his physical or mental stamina. Dan Walker, who has been expelled from the college, said pledge members were told to skin squirrels for stew, drink toilet water, drink alcohol, and eat hot peppers."
Students cited,
for disruptions,"Three students of Bucknell University were cited over the weekend by Lewisburg police on charges of disrupting the peace by hosting loud parties. Another student was cited for underage drinking. On Friday night, police cited Robin Moore '93 for underage drinking. Robert Moses and Josh Gorham were charged Saturday for disorderly conduct, and Louis 'Ray was cited early Sunday for disQr- 6 derly conduct."
Bias to lecture,
about drugs,"Lonise Bias, the mother of Len Bias, a University of Maryland bas ketball player who died four years ago, will speak at the Weis Center on March 12 on the abuse of illicit drugs. Since the drug-related death of her son, who was the second NBA draft pick and had been invited to play for the Boston Celtics, Bias has taken her message to college stu dents. In her speeches, Bias speaks not only about the problems of drug abuse, but also about God, sex, and unwanted children. Through the nearly 60 speeches she has delivered. Bias has tried to find something positive in her son's death. A deeply Christian woman, she refuses to say her son's death was untimely. Rather, she be lieves his death was a message, and it is this message which she attempts to relate to students. ..,,.Tjhe Multiculture Center and ..the.

As part of the comprehensive study of asbestos cases, federal judges predicted that the number of these cases will increase by 50 per cent within the next three years. For each asbestos case tried or settled, roughly two new cases are being filed. Deaths caused by asbestos, rarely used today because of its known harms to human beings, have recently begun to surface. By the end of the century, asbestos will have caused as many as 200,000 deaths in the United States, according to ex perts."
Senate looks at,

""I've led an interesting life, but I'm confident that in the way I've conducted my political life over the last 20 years, I've only done what I should have done,"" said Alexander, president of the University of Tennessee and former governor of the state. The article which spurred Alexander's statement indicated no evidence of wrongdoing, but said that his political standing attracted business executives to include Alexander in their investments. Alexander said that he is will ing to publicly answer questions about his financial investments."

Audition class assists aspiring actors,"Courtesy of Public Relations Tom Quinn *91 (left) and Andrew Garman '91 (right) prepare for an audition as part of a new class created by Bob Gainer (standing), chair and associate professor of theatre. By David Murray Staff Writer They say 'practice makes per fect,' but in the world of professional acting, practice makes money. That's because one four-minute au dition can make or break an actor's chances for performing with a com pany. But how does an actor learn the art of the audition? Until this semester, the only answer was 'trial and error.' But Bob Gainer, chair and associate professor of theatre, has changed all that. His new course on auditioning By Peter Lalos Staff Writer In a break from tradition (as suring there is any here as of yet), and in response to numerous letters cf complaint from KISS (the Kouncil of International Spelling Supporters), this week's ""Colle giate Perspective"" will concern it self with purely academic pursuits. To wit, the following column has devoted its space to an alphabetical listing of university terminology in which every college-age student should be well-versed. absence frenzy n. The cau tious state of euphoria which grips a classroom of students when their professor is not in attendance at five after the hour. awakeagony n. The mental stress undergone by a bed-ridden student as he/she waits for the final five minutes to elapse before his/ her alarm sounds. baitbrag v. To ask a friend what he/she did over the past weekend in order to foment a situ ation in which you can impress him/her with what you did during that same period of time. botheretaliation n. The act of repeatedly striking the wall, ceiling or floor beside, above, or below one's room (resp.) in order to inform a dormmatc that the noise emanating from his/her room has reached an unacceptable level. chronofixation n. During a boring lecture, the affliction in volving students wherein they check their watches every ten minutes to see how much time is left in that class period. closet disconcertation n. The embarrassment which results from forgetting where you placed your personal belongings in the cafeteria coatrooms. corneal evasion n. 1) Visual tactic used toward professors by students who have not adequately prepared for the day's lecture dis cussion, esp. when they do not de sire to be called upon to answer a was created expressly to teach stu dents bound for the stage how to play the role of auditioner. ""Auditioning is the first thing you do as a professional,"" Gainer says. ""The judges--directors or casting agents--want to see how you handle stress and how you work with a director."" With a 98 per cent unemploy ment rate in their industry, actors face a great deal of stress. For those hoping to enroll in the Yale School of Drama, for instance, each actor must beat out thousands of other candidates. Yale receives 2,500 ap- question. 2) Visual tactic utilized by students who pass people on the sidewalk who they have met but do not know well enough to greet. deluminoria n. The phe nomenon in which all of your hall lights will invariably be turned off when you wake up in the morning. hollowvocalize v. To make an entirely unprofound, trivial contribution to a lecture discussion simply because you feel that it is again about time that you reminded the professor that you are on the class roster. kleptavoyeurism n. The sensation that a student receives upon entering the bookstore that he/she is being monitored as a po tential shoplifter; the feeling in creases exponentially as one gets closer to the CD and cassette tape section. mailinger v. To stand in front of one's mailbox while read ing one's mail, esp. when there is a sizeable throng of students waiting to be allowed access to their own boxes. monoconsumphobia n. The fear of eating alone in the cafeteria. new potatoes n. I'm still working on this one. placement amnesia n. The phenomenon of forgetting where/if one stored any personal belongings in the cafeteria coatrooms. salutation selection n. The mental process by which John the Bagman decides who to wish ""good luck"" and who not to. schizodiscover v. The act of overhearing a hallmate talking to him/herself in the toilet stall beside you since he/she believes that he/ she is alone in the bathroom. So impress your friends, baffle your professors, and win over that all-important date with your newly expanded vocabulary this spring! Besides, there will be a quiz on this at the end of the se mester... I've been known to do that. I mean it... you there, in the back! Yeah, YOU! Don't push me, hairball! plications each year and can accept only 14 students. Standing out in such a huge field of competitors is where Gainer's course comes in. He helps students understand that ""It requires such fortitude, will, and talent to be an actor that they need to start facing early the reality they are going to confront in the worlds of theatre and film."" Most professional auditions require an actor to perform two dra matic monologues--one in the clas sical style and one more contempo rary. Gainer says his class helps give students ""technical ways of estab lishing the reality of a monologue."" Beyond that, students learn ways of ""dealing with the nature of the text"" and ""techniques ot presentation,"" according to Gainer. The course also gives students an opportunity to practice some other critical elements of auditioning: characterization, im provisation, and imagination, among others. In addition to review by"
Bertha the,"By David Soli Staff Writer If you ever have insomnia at 4:45 a.m., think of Bertha Swartz, because she is just arriving at work in the cafeteria bake shop. More af fectionately known as ""Bertha the Baker,"" she prepares all of the baked goods served in the cafeteria and the Bison. The first task of her day is to bake from scratch the donuts for that morning's breakfast. Donuts hot out of the oven are one of the few items which Bertha bakes that she actually eats. Being a diabetic, her choices are limited. But there are certain items which Bertha wouldn't eat anyway. For example, she com mented, ""1 hate the cheesecake and the kids are getting tired of it too."" Because Bertha is responsible for baking for the whole campus, she has to take into account the students' tastes and appetites as well as her own preferences. Although Hank Ross, director of Dining Services, plans the cafeteria menus, Bertha manages to stay attuned to the stu dents' tastes by keeping track of which desserts are consistently left"

j,"Gainer himself, students in the class perform for various area profession als. According to Gainer, he and two students recently traveled to Bloomsburg where ""two members of the Bloomsburg Theatre En semble company commented and gave critical feedback"" on the Bucknellians' audition perfor mances. Gainer believes such re views help answer the question ""How does the actor use his instru ment [himself] truthfully, expres sively, and effectively so it commu nicates optimally to the critical ob server?"" Andrew Garman '91 and Tom Quinn '91 are two of Gainer's pupils who aspire to be professional actors. They assert that in an audition one should be prepared for anything. For example, a casting agent once asked Garman during an audi tion to play Prince Hal from Shakespeare's Henry V as if he were a baby. ""They want to see if you can take direction,"" said Garman. Outside circumstances can over (such as the cheesecake). The most popular treat, she says, is chocolate chip cookies. She bakes 5,800 of them at a time. Her recipe calls for an amazing 25 pounds of chocolate chips and 24 pounds of butter per batch of cook ies. Bertha's recipes won't work on a small scale, she says, so she couldn't reveal any of her secret for mulas. Because Bertha has to prepare such large quantities of food, she needs assistants. Susan Thomas and Bobby Shimmel, both of whom have worked for Dining Services for close to thirty years, and newcomer Verna Weller assist Bertha in her baking. The atmosphere in the bake shop is friendly, but Bertha has one rigid rule: no licking the pans until after the batter is poured. Taught to bake by her father while she was growing up, Bertha brought her skills to Bucknell in the early '60's. She started as an assis tant in the men's dining room in Swartz Hall. Three years later, Ber tha moved downhill to Larison Hall to assist in the bake shop. The biggest change she has seen in the food service over the HEADING FOR EUROPE THIS SUMMER?

Gainer's course is offered each fall, but since acting companies and graduate school programs hold years has been the consolidation of the facilities in 1971 with the open ing of the Roy Bostwick Cafeteria. Bertha was put in charge of her own bakeshop when the cafeteria opened and has worked there ever since. Bertha has worked under three din- auditions between December and March, students continue meeting with Gainer through the beginning of the spring semester.

Dean Dancers and,
Musicians blend well,"By Tina Henninger The Weis Center was taken by storm last Saturday as the Laura Dean Dancers and Musicians took the stage for an amazing evening of live music and dance. The evening's success was due to Laura Dean's unique ap proach to the art of dance as she is both the choreographer and com poser of her works. To emphasize the importance of music to dance, Dean has both the dancers and mu sicians perform simultaneously on stage. Dean does not believe in the concept of soloists or principle dancers, so no single dancer was featured in her work. As a result of this idea, the Laura Dean Dancers created a sense of community, which was evidenced in their dancing. Choreography was also used to enhance the oneness of the group; each dance was character ized by spinning movements, foot patterns and distinctive arm and hand gestures. When performed by the dancers, this vocabulary of movement created an intricate vi sual pattern for the audience. The constant manipulation of the space forced the viewer to focus on the whole picture and not on a particu lar dancer. A highlight of the company's visit to Bucknell was a modem dance class offered to members of the campus and Lewisburg com munity. Company dancer Anne Wennerstrand taught the class and successfully shared the style of the Laura Dean Dancers with those in attendance. According to Janelle Oltorik, ""she had a different tech nique that was interesting to learn, and it was exciting to have such a well-known company come to Bucknell."""

A,"Capella following, to perform three standing-room-only concerts with the Washington Pikers and Greenleaves, the University's male and female groups, respectively, and Duke University's male group, the Pitchforks. Unfortunately, the trip seemed doomed from the start. Only nine of the eleven Chips were able to make the journey because of illness, and almost all who did go were also sick, but they were a success nevertheless, receiving a standing ovation from a crowd of over seven hundred their final night. The song that managed to ""al ways bring the house down"" was Madonna's ""Like A Virgin,"" a song sung at Chip Fest last year and as stated by Chip Craig Bitter, no longer to be performed on campus because it is ""too embarrassing."" This act includes soloist Andrew Lunstad strutting down the stage in a lovely dress, much to the admiration of the other Chips who are bedecked"

annual Celebration,
o f the Arts Weekend,"Courtesy o f Craig Bitter A highlight of the Bison Chips' recent trip to St. Louis was posing for a picture with a bison statue at the museum at the St. Louis Arch. Fortunately, a nearby security officer was able to track down an actual petrified bison chip to complete the photo. Pictured left to right are: Tim Anderson '94, Craig Bitter '93, Chris Bowen '91, Andrew Lunstad '91, Rick Cranford '92, Mark Leister '91, Peter West '93, Chris Wil liams '92 and Eric Hogdson '94. with sunglasses and beaded neck laces. Humorously, the founder of the Washington Pikers threw change at the Bison Chips during the first performance of this song, leading members of the audience to throw money the following night. In addition to performing, the trip gave the Chips the opportunity to visit the sights of St. Louis. Highlights included visits to the Anheuser-Busch Brewery and the St. Louis Arch, at the top of which they performed ""Only You"" with the group from Duke. The Chips always enjoy working with other groups because, according to Chip Pete West, ""A Capella people usually seem to mesh well with other A Capella groups."" The fact that they had more free time to get to know the other singers made this trip even better than previous ones. Fortunately, an opportunity that they thought would be a right- marc turned out well. As Pete West said, ""It was a moral victory far us. We were able to work hard, puil to gether, and everything really came out well. It was a big accomplish ment."" Though the Chips did riot travel in the fall, this was their sec ond trip this semester after Cornell University on February 15. They have received many invitations fiom other schools which they will accept if scheduling permits. In the mean time, however, the Bison Chips vill remain on campus preparing for Chip Fest coming Parents' Week end, April 26, at the Weis Center."

Concordia to liven up Weis with,
a concert that is far from typical,
Classics and new works to be performed with Broadway star,"By Laura Grisin Staff Writer The Concordia Symphony will perform their unique blend of jazz and American classics under the direction of Marin Alsop, the first female recipient of the Koussevitsky Conducting Prize, 8 p.m. tomorrow in the Weis Center. The performance will feature Tony Award-winning singer and actress Judy Kaye who most recently sang the role of Carlotta in the Broadway production of The Phantom of the Opera. ""The program, which includes works by Aaron Copland and George Gershwin, promises an op portunity to see two very talented artists in an evening of light music and orchestral jazz,"" said William Boswell, director of cultural events. ""It's especially appropriate that works by Copland are being per formed, since this hero of American music passed away just a few months ago. And it's a chance to break preconceptions that an or chestra must be conducted by a man."" Courtesy o f Public Relations The Concordia Symphony (pictured above) will present American classics by Aaron Copland and George Gershwin as well as a very recent work by Robert Christianson tomorrow night at the Weis Center. Judy Kaye (pictured below), who recently won a Tony Award for her role in Broadway's Phantom of the Opera, will be featured with the orchestra. Courtesy of Public Relations The Koussevitsky Conducting Prize is an honor that Alsop shares with the legendary Leonard Bernstein. She explained that at the age of 11 or 12, she knew that she wanted to be a conductor, but con ducting was not an activity for a young girl to seriously pursue. She said, however, that the situation for women has changed a lot since then, especially in the last 5 years. She stated, ""Ten years ago, what I've done wouldn't have been possible."" What she has accomplished is significant. A graduate of Yale Uni versity and the Julliard School, she serves as music director of the Long Island Philharmonic and the Eugene Symphony Orchestra in Oregon. Last year she participated in the First Pacific Music Festival in Japan with Leonard Bernstein and Michael Tilson Thomas. In May she became the first woman to conduct the Bos ton Pops Orchestra in its 107 year history. Alsop created Concordia in 1984 to eliminate the barriers that audiences have placed between jazz and classical music. She spoke of the misconception that ""classical is stiff and jazz is hip."" With her orchestra, however, she has succeeded in mak ing ""people looser about listening to classical music."" Concordia presents a classical repertoire along with new American jazz and 20th century works. The orchestra has, in fact, premiered more than 20 new American works under Alsop's leadership. Saturday's program will include Copland's ""Music for the Theatre"" and George Gershwin's Overture to ""Oh, Kay!"" Rounding out the performance will be Robert Christianson's ""Tone Poem for a New Age"" which com bines the elements of popular and classical music. Christianson's ex perience includes arranging for and performing with Aretha Franklin, Diana Ross, and Chaka Khan. The second half of the concert will feature Broadway singer Judy Kaye who will sing a group of American folk songs arranged by Copland, as well as three Gershwin pieces accompanied by their original orchestrations including ""Embrace- able You"" and ""I Got Rhythm."" Tickets for Concordia ($10 with a Bucknell I.D.) are still avail able at the Weis Center Box Office and at the door."
The Silence of the Lambs,

New suspense film is a must-see,"By Vic Tchiprout chiatrist played by Anthony and Laura Grisin Staff Writer Certain to be one of the year's best thrillers. The Silence of the Lambs is an intense and chill ing film that is not to be missed. Lambs stars Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling, a FBI trainee who is assigned to gather information Hopkins, Clarice leams to think like a killer. Clarice's attempt to ""silence the lambs"" makes for enough spine-tingling suspense to keep you out of both elevators and basements like Psycho kept you out of showers. The audience was on the edge of their seats, especially dur ing the scenes in which Clarice on psychotic serial killer Buffalo Bill who has taken to skinning his victims. It is the childhood memory of her father's murder as well as the slaughtering and ""screaming of the lambs"" at her uncle's sheep ranch that drives her in her quest for jus tice. Through a series of tense dis cussions with Hannibal ""the Can nibal"" Lecter, an imprisoned psy- speaks with Dr. Lecter through the glass wall of his cell. With echoes of the guard's warning, ""Don't get close to the glass!"" resounding through one's head, one could only imagine the consequences if she did. And what could happen to anyone who got too close to Lecter? Perhaps you should see this film for yourself."

Naked Lunch meets every Wednesday at noon in the Langone Center Cave giving Bucknellians the opportunity to share their creativity. Since the birth of Naked Lunch three years ago, people have yet to show up naked. A change this semester, however, is an expansion in the artistic genre. The walls of the Cave will now be available for stu dents to hang paintings, sketches and photographs, and the microphone will be open to musicians as well as readers of poetry and fiction. Stephanie Priai, who spear headed Naked Lunch's public rela tions campaign, believes that cre ative students need a reliable outlet for their work.

It's time for a resignation,
Or will Howard force Bucknell to drag this out?,"Four Bucknell women are still missing this week after being left stranded in Worcester, Massachusetts by their basketball coach, Lori Howard. The four were last seen hitch-hiking on 1-84. The parents of the four have filed a six-million-dollar class-action lawsuit against Bucknell University for negligence. Fortunately, this case is a fictitious one, but the possibility became very real last Saturday. Not only did it have the potential to become a tragedy, but it could have posed a liability nightmare for the University. In fact, it still might Coach Howard exercised poor judgement when she refused transportation back from the Patriot League tour nament to four players who had been caught drinking the night before. It is an understood policy that the coach is responsible for the safety of the athletes from the time they leave Bucknell until the time they return. It was uncon scionable to put these four women and the University at risk. Although Howard had confirmation that one of the player's parents would provide the four a ride back to Bucknell, leaving them alone still put them at risk and placed the University in a liability predicament. Furthermore, the infringement upon the free time of the parents raises further questions of misconduct and liability. Does Howard expect the University to foot the bill for her mistake? While it is true that individual coaches determine their own alcohol policies, the disciplinary action taken by Howard was reprehensible. The welfare of the athletes should always be foremost in the coach's mind; Howard's bad judgement may have resulted from any number of frustrations, including her team's 2-24 season, but that cannot excuse her actions. The athletes may have been in violation of the team's policy prohibiting drinking during the season. This infraction should have entailed an appropriate reprimand when the team returned to Bucknell; they should not have been made to walk the plank. The hard feelings between the women's basketball players and their head coach are apparent. Howard has lost the respect of many team members and many of her colleagues in the athletic department Her continued presence at Bucknell will only serve to salt already open wounds; hence, she would be doing both herself and the University a favor by tendering her immediate resignation. If she will not resign. Athletic Director Rick Hartzell will be forced to conduct a lengthy and in-depth review of her actions which will not only place a tremendous emotional burden on the team members, but probably reflect poorly on Howard as well. In any case, the University would be putting itself in jeopardy once again if it were to renew Howard's contract Will Howard bow out gracefully? She exercised poor judgement once; can we count on her to make the right decision now?"

Reader disturbed by,
writer's prison review,"To the Editor: In the Feb 15 th issue of The Bucknellian, Peter Lalos reviewed the HBO special on the Lewisburg penitentiary. Among his comments were the following remarks: ""Another inmate...demonstrated the ten dency of many prisoners to gradually accept the countless hardships and loss of basic liberties. He calmly described the widespread homosexuality amongst the inmate ranks. Despite the distribution of condoms in the facility, AIDS- related deaths in the prisoner population are an almost com mon occurrence, an expected fact of life."" I was disturbed by Lalos' intimation that homosexuality in prison is an example of the ""countless hardships and loss of basic liberties"" that inmates come to ""gradually accept"" Certainly one of the horrors of prison is homosexual rape. But it is important to make the distinction between rape and homosexuality. All homo sexual relationships in prison are not rape, and homosexuality itself is certainly not a ""hard ship"" or a ""loss of basic liber ties."" Homophobia is a hard ship endured by homosexuals, and homophobic reaction to homosexuality can result in ""loss of basic liberties."" But homosexuality itself is simply,"
"S,",
_________________,"like heterosexuality, an expression of human love or desire. I was also concerned that Lalos immediately moved from homosexuality to AIDS, as if ho mosexuality were the cause of all the AIDS related deaths in the prison. First of all, let's step back and remember that homosexuality is never the cause of AIDS. Unsafe sex is, but not homosexuality. Also, Lalos doesn't mention the sharing of needles in I.V. drug use, which, like unsafe sex, is a high risk behavior which can spread the AIDS-virus. It's also important to remember that some people may have come into the prison already HIV positive, perhaps from I.V. drug use, or unsafe sex with male and/or female partners. From the way Peter describes the situation in that one paragraph, it's as if homosexuality is a ""hard ship"" that must be endured by pris oners. Furthermore, it seems as if he's saying homosexuality causes AIDS and leads to the ""common occurrence"" of death as ""an ex pected fact of life."" My guess is that Peter did not mean to put down homosexuality or to say that gay people cause AIDS and death, but that is how this particular paragraph comes out. It is the assumptions behind the paragraph that concern me. I'm much more worried about the un conscious ways in which we dimin ish or disenfranchise people than I am concerned about easily recog nizable, blatant homophobic at tacks. Some of you probably read that paragraph and thought nothing of it. And while you were reading it you probably weren't thinking ""homosexual ity is an affliction"" or ""gay men cause AIDS."" But both of those mes sages are implicit in the para graph and you may easily have taken those messages in without questioning their negative im plications. This is how stereo types and myths get perpetu ated. No one challenges those assumptions, and pretty soon you're constantly connecting gay men, AIDS, and death in such a way that gay men=AIDS=death. This is very dangerous, precisely because it happens on such an uncon scious level. It's also sometimes very difficult to see what our own assumptions are, especially if we're part of a mainstream group. If the way we see things is supported by the world around us, then it's easy to confuse assumptions for reality. I write this letter to point out how easy it is to link negative images to non-dominant groups, especially in a culture like ours where ""different"" is often seen as ""deficient"" or negatively ""deviant.""

draws criticism,
Cartoon,"To the Editor: In the March 1,1991 issue of The Bucknellian, a cartoon by Corey Zayatz appeared on the Opinions page, called ""how our school got its name."" This drawing of a man with his pants down hand ing a ""buck"" to a prostitute named ""Nell,"" was offensive and disturb ing to me. What is particularly ironic about this illustration is that it ap peared directly above a letter from President Sojka which condemned sexual assault on campus and urged the community to become more aware of this issue. Sexual assault, prostitution, and sexist humor are not unrelated. Treating women as objects, using their bodies as com modities, is part of a continuum of sexism that has rape and violence against women at its extreme. They have learned through early indoctri nation that their sexuality is not their won and that others can con trol the use of their bodies. It's important to women on this campus and across the country that educational efforts to reduce sexism be taken seriously. When items such as this appear in a main stream medium for news, it demon strates a lack of understanding and respect women. Some will say ""It's humor, can't you take a joke?"" The problem is that sexism disguised as humor is not funny to its victims. Accepting such jokes contributes to an attitude that makes discrimina tion and objectification of women more acceptable. Plantation owners trivialized and made fun of their black slaves and got away with treating them like property. Nazi forces humili ated Jews as well as gay men and lesbians in Germany and laughed at their suffering. The problem is that just as these oppressors did not stop at making jests and using disempowered groups as the butt of their humor, some men do not stop with ridiculing women. The sys tematic dehumanization of blacks, Jews, gays, lesbians, and women includes torture and brutality, sexual assault and murder. Atti tudes affect behavior. Views that promote the idea that women are objects for men's pleasure or com modities to be bought, that their intellect and emotions do not count, and that their position, wrath, and appearance can be trivialized, are all links in the chain of oppression that keep men and women from being equal. I am not suggesting that last week's cartoon be censored. I sup port Zayatz's right to freedom of expression. I am, in turn, exercising my right to express my disappoint ment and concern. What he and To the Editor: Every week The Bucknellian manages to offend me with at least one sexist article, photo, or cartoon. I have put up with photographs of subservient sorority women shining men's shoes [Feb. 22, p. 11], I have tried to ignore the countless articles that refer to women as mere sex objects (""I grabbed myself this slam-hound from Australia with really firm...Kangaroos, and she took me to her room and TOSSED MY BOOMERANG!!!"" [Feb. 15, p. 11]). But I cannot let the cartoon from last week slide. For those of you who did not see it, there was an illustration of a prostitute named Nell being paid a dollar for her ""services."" The caption reads, ""How Our School Got Its Name."" I am outraged that the editors some how thought that this cartoon was See CARTOON, page 10 See DRAWING, page 10"

""We've come a long way. Baby,"" followed by a photograph from 1914 and one as recent as the 1950's, seems a rather idiotic attempt to describe the evolutioi of Greek roles at Bucknell.

An honor code should be implemented at Bucknell,"By Chris Bender What is the value of an honor code? Why is it important that Bucknell should have an honor code? Why is it that so many top schools in the country have honor codes? Since I went to a high school that had an honor code, I know its values and have come to wonder why Bucknell does not have one. The value and im'portance of an honor code is simple. It lets one grow to understand the value of be ing a responsible, moral person. It teaches each individual the reasons, the value, and the importance of living life this way. By having rules imposed upon individuals, one does not see or learn why rules are in place. They are just seen as barriers and restrictions that signify a lack of trust. An honor code lets an indi vidual reflect on the fact that his ac tions are his responsibility. Without an honor code or without people be ing honorable on their own, this im portant value is neglected and people will leave Bucknell and enter the world without fully understanding the meaning of personal integrity and true responsibility. The reasons Bucknell should have and needs an honor code are very obvious. One simple reason is the problem of low morale. This is partly due to social restrictions which demeaned students by sym bolizing a lack of trust by our ad ministration. Once regulations be came more student-run, morale picked up and students began to show their ability to be responsible for themselves and peers in social activity. The more responsibility we are given, the better students will feel about themselves and Bucknell. An honor code does not just encom pass academia, it entails all aspects of student life. It means being an honorable responsible person in all situations, academic and social. College should be a time to leant to make the right decisions for the right reasons, individually. As one learns to make these decisions for himself, he learns to be an individual. Buck nell can increase morale and teach students to be individuals through an honor code. Faculty also should support an honor code. They are at Bucknell to teach and educate as experts in their fields. They are not here to babysit and monitor students. The teaching is up to the faculty and the learning is up to the students. Let professors do what they are educators for, to teach us. Let them not enforce rules and regulations but represent and show students the higher ideals rep resented in an honor code. This does not mean naivete by faculty but sets up an understanding between stu dents and faculty that is more posi tive. Faculty, too, can feel better about their university because of the standards that it represents. I have proposed the idea of an honor code to students and faculty to see the response. The answer I re ceived a few times irked me. It was,"" It would never work at Buck nell because it is too competitive here."" If this is the case, than what good is Bucknell, its values, and its education? Is it Bucknell's mission to bring people into the world who are immoral and who will achieve status through corruption? Our so ciety already fosters people who are corrupt even in high political offices. Society needs people with integrity and good value systems. I hope that the idea of an education entails teaching students to be moral, hon est, responsible people, and other important values that will shape their decisions and our future. Students with this type of understanding, will also realize the reason they are re ceiving an education, to learn be cause they want to. The problem with rules against behavior is that when a stu dent breaks this rule, this is all they see. They realize they got away with it, broke a rule, and didn't get caught Whether they know it ra not, they do not see that they have cheated themselves of knowledge, acted irresponsibly, and were dis honest to themselves as well as their peers. The individual is too con cerned with breaking the ""rule"" to truly understand what they have done or eventually, to learn from it. If students cannot act responsibly without being watched over after graduation, then perhaps they haven't received the best education. It has been stated that a person who cheats on tests will see no rea son to stop in the future. He will grow to more corrupt actions in the future. Without realizing the immo rality of being dishonest, what would stop this person from accepting bribes or embezzling funds in the future? Teach the value of morality now and let students see why they should not cheat in life and prevent future corruption in the future. This should be part of an individual's growth through education. The less a school needs to regulate its stu dents because students are capable of making the right decisions on their own, the better the school and the better the education. My high school had an honor code and I truly did not see its value and importance until after gradua tion when I realized how it influ enced my growth as an individual and shaped my high school experi ence. This code was presented in the beginning of each academic year and was on a plaque for everyone enter ing the school to see. The idea of the code was to make each individual the best person he could be by real izing his goals, desires, faults, and strengths individually. It gave a base for each student to create his own personal honor code which would shape our morals and future actions. Bucknell should have an honor code because the quality of faculty and students at this school deserve the responsibility. If a true education is going to be served, each student should leave Bucknell with at least a basis, or set of morals, to guide him in his decisions and ac tions. If Bucknell wants this kind of student, it must first trust that this kind of student can exist. Bucknell needs a code of conduct and set of principles that can guide us in mak ing the right decisions instead of telling us. This University should stand as a role model for the indi viduals that it educates and for the providers of this education. When I went to high school, I felt special and full of pride because I knew I was trusted. This trust and responsibility made me realize the importance of everything I did because I had a standard to live up to. Because it was my responsibility, my actions not only shaped the way I was per ceived by my peers but shaped the way I felt about myself. When I did what was right it made me feel good because I was living up to the stan dards I had accepted by attending my school and being part of that com munity. No one is perfect and I do break these rules occasionally but in the end I always grow a little bit more because I develop a deeper un- See HONOR, page 10"

Drum,"By Marc Haimes The . Junior High School Locker Room was directly across from the Biology Lab. On hot days we approached the brazen ""MEN ONLY"" sign griping our noses in response to the lacerating scent of sweat and formaldehyde. But the smell wasn't the worst of it... Bobby Moss and Peter Mite had thick black chest fur up to their neck, sideburns, and globules of testosterone dripping out their ears. Their sheer enormity made them the most idolized and the most terrifying beasts in school. They dwelled in the alcove by the urinals with an arsenal of wet towels to snap, and worse. Their prey: The ""Late Bloomers"" whose pre-pubescent shrieks merely blended in with the high-pitched screeching of sneakers on the gym nasium floor above. I spent hours scratching my whisker-less chin and wondering why assaulting 12 year olds with dirty jock-straps made Moss and Mite so gleeful. They would grunt, high five, and jump up and down so you could hear their brains rattling around in their head like a tic-tac in a tuna can. Why? Last night I saw ""Tango And Cash"" and now I finally understand. ""Tango And Cash"" is a ""buddy cop"" movie starring Sylvester 'yo Adrienne' Stallone and Kurt Russell. The novel plot premise in this movie is that at first, the steroid swallowing Stanislavskys don't really like each other. How ever, after smashing some wimpy thugs, torturing an evil mastermind with a menacing foreign accent, and taking a shower together while ad miring each other's private parts, the two become jubilant comrades. Note the heart-warming rapport be tween the two pals in this climatic scene where they prepare to confront the evil mastermind with the foreign accent and drop a grenade down his pants. Kurt: Hey Dude, lets go kick some ass! Sylvester: Yeah man. Let's.. .smash their butts. Kurt: Yeah, Dude, then we'll uh ... thrash their hineys. Sylvester: Alright man, after that we'll urn... YO ADRIENNE The film triumphantly con cludes with Sylvester giving Kurt 'permission' to date his sister. Then the cronies ruggedly high-five while Sylvester's sibling looks meekly up at her two sweaty men, resting from the three and a half lines she had to deliver during the entire movie. It's easy to poke fun at the thousands of films like ""Tango and Cash,"" where muscular mutilations precede clever quips and enthusias tic high-fives, until you really con sider what adolescents'leam' about ""real men"" from these movies. We learn that nothing brings ""real men"" closer together than bat tling a common enemy. Someone to kick and smash and snap wet towels at. To castrate. Preferably a sly, for eign, effeminate weakling who al ways seems to slip away with an evil high pitched laugh until the final scene when the hero corners him and blows up his house.

Do you think that the Bison and bookstore unfairly,
raise their prices because they have no competition?,"By Stephanie Cohen Ignacio Diaz-Alonso '91 Accounting Kirsten Kelley '92 Education Glenda D'urso Bison employee Craig Bitter '92 English Gary Sojka University President Andrea Sauchelli '93 Accounting ""Yes. The interests of students are not really represented in the university's decisions. If they were, the university would allow competition and provide better quality goods and services at lower prices. However, as it stands now, the university is gouging the students for all they can bear. Why can I get milk at Weis for $.53 and at the Bison l for $.75?"" ""Yes. For people who don't have cars there is no other choice but to buy the basics in the Bison or the bookstore. Without competition, both of these places are taking advantage of students."" ""No I do not They went to local stores and did a survey of prices in surrounding areas--and the prices at the Bison are not out of sight. I do not know about the bookstore."" ""I wouldn't say that it's because of unfair competition. It's more the fact that they get away with charg ing higher prices--simply because our parents are paying for it. The prices they charge are simply un fair. The school shouldn't be mak ing an excessive profit unfairly simply because we have no other place to buy food and supplies."" ""I'm not involved with pricing but I do know that they survey the local merchants to check prices. Because they serve as a convenience to the students and do not wish to undercut the local merchants they are not likely to run the lowest price. But, they do not specifically set out to raise prices for students."" ""Yes. They know these are the only places we have to shop and buy food and they take advantage of us."""

Speaking on behalf of the dead Iraqi soldiers,"By Charles Sackrey What good am I If I can't hear you cry? (Bob Dylan) Last night, in a local restaurant, I overheard the conversation among six men at a nearby table. 'The fifty calibers must have gone right through the tanks,"" one of them said. ""The napalm sure slowed them down,"" another said. The laughter around the table. "" Yeah,"" another said, ""On televi sion, there's a truck load of about 25 Iraqi soldiers, and then there's a big poof, then all of the sudden no more Iraqi soldiers."" Table wide laughter. Then more admiring chatter about the weaponry. That conversation reminded me of a recent exchange in the foyer of the Univer sity, when some of us in S.T.O.P. staged a ""sit-in"" to bring attention to our view of the war. A s students from classes poured through the doors, one of our group said to them as they passed, "" No more bombing."" Mostly, she was ignored, but not by two male students, one of whom stomped his boot on a peace sign of the floor, while the other muttered ""Let's kill them all."" Over the past six weeks there have been thousands, maybe millions, of these kinds of comments, at Bucknell, downtown in Lewisburg, over the television, every where. One colonel, a flyer, compared a convoy o f Iraqis, caught in the open by night-vision radar, to ""a bunch of big-city cockroaches, who came out at night, and so we killed them."" All these comments and reports depict the Iraqi soldiers as sub-hu man creatures, not worthy o f dignity, and thus not worthy of life. The truth is undeni able that some Iraqi soldiers raped and pil laged and tortured Kuwaitis. How many did that? No one will ever really know, except the simple logistics of an army of half a million men spread across a vast desert has to mean that pillaging Iraqi soldiers were a distinct minority. What I have read tells me the great majority of the Iraqi army was drafted into service, in one way or another, death or im prisonment if they refused. Apparently, about one third of all Iraqi males from the ages of 15-39 were in the military at the be ginning of the war. And what must be true about these men is that they shared the most fundamental aspects of being human with their American and Allied counterparts. For example, these Iraqi conscripts have mothers and fathers, perhaps a hundred thousand of whom-- perhaps it's two hun dred thousand of whom-- now must wail into the night that their sons have been killed in action; that their sons are missing in ac tion; that their sons have been burned alive by napalm, fried to death inside a tank; that their sons are inside an American prison camp; that their sons might have lost eyes, legs, arms, skulls, teeth. Maybe 35,000 of these sons. Maybe 100,000. Who knows? The children of these Iraqi conscripts, and their brothers and sisters and cousins and nieces and nephews might also this moment be lying in their beds, gaunt eyes looking at the ceiling, squelching tears, shedding tears, worrying about whether their fathers, or brothers, or cousins, mighthave been burned inside a bunker, blown apart by the fire from a helicopter, vaporized while riding the top of a truck that was trying to flee a murderous battlefield. These Iraqi soldiers must also have had sweethearts back home. Outside of Kuwait City, as thousands fled north to es cape a losing cause, intrucks, tanks, old cars, they ran into the horrificconsequences of an order from George Bush, or one o f his sol diers, to destroy them completely. Bodies, strewn on seven miles o f highway, were found dismembered and burned, and along side some o f them were what the papers called ""booty,"" jewelry, women's clothes. The newspapers seemed to imply that the soldiers had looted Kuwait City, and while taking their plunder home were caught like rats in the open desert, the booty all the more evidence they should be destroyed. I found myself wondering if some of this jewelry might have been presents for sweethearts. Maybe not, whatever these fleeing soldiers did, it must have been true that their bodies on the ground were not too long ago on some Iraqi city, clean shaven, swaggering about the streets in their finest clothes, trying to attract someone they thought beautiful. In these days of mandatory patriotism, can we find room inside ourselves to have a bit o f pity for these Iraqi soldiers? Isn't it true that most of them were victimized by Saddam Hussein's megalomania? And isn't From page 9 does not solely exist on a movie screen, however. Remember when we got finished hating the Soviets a few years ago? W ell, it wasn't long before a new W A R  O N  D R U G S  began and the U S showed its strength by capturing accused coke-fiend Manuel Noriega and publicly popping all of his zits. On a personal level, it true that when George Bush decided to teach Saddam Hussein a lesson, he also de cided to have tens of thousands o f these Iraqi soldiers killed? And, if we can't find it in our souls to have pity for these Iraqi soldiers, can we pause for a moment of pity for their parents, their children, or cousins, or neph ews, or for their sweethearts? And, whether we can or cannot feel that pity, can we stop to think what it means that last week we Americans were, in a great majority, urging the president to teach Saddam Hussein ever harsher lessons, which meant o f course, more Iraqi soldiers lying dead in the sand, more mothers, fathers, children, brothers, sisters, cousins, sweet hearts, wailing into the dark Iraqi night? we might apply this shallow hatred to play ers on a football team, or a lawyer, or a slow driver on the highway. We mutate people into two-dimensional, black and white scapegoats as we assert our glossy full-color strength. W e also learn to see women as prizes, that can be won if the man smashes enough dehumanized bad guys and impresses them with his power. Or as faithful Saint Bernards that placidly supply the men with beers after they've finished blowing up commies with rocket launchers. Sometimes women are depicted as property that is stolen from the ""good guy""  until he comes to retrieve it in a fit o f hormonal rage. Perhaps, we eventually realize that there is more to life than smashing and bashing. W e understand that we shouldn't mindlessly idolize or worship another hu man being, just because he wields power and manages to identify a ""bad guy"" that can be overcome. Now that adolescence is over and the scent o f the ""M E N  O N L Y "" sign is mal odorous memory, we have finally learned to evaluate all aspects of an individual before euphorically deeming him/her a "" hero."" Haven't we?"

"Hard work, focus pay off for Marchetti",
Bison All-American pushes to becom e Bucknell's first-ever national champion wrestler,m
<<,"By M itch Benton Staff Writer It would ,be easy for Tom Marchetti '91 to relax and enjoy the conclusion of his senior year in col lege. He has already achieved more then anyone could have expected upon his entering Bucknell. Marchetti has been an All- American, a three-time conference champion and this school's all-time wrestling statistical leader, but that doesn't appear to satisfy this com petitor. One of the most accom plished wrestlers in Bucknell his tory, he's pushing himself to become Bucknell's first ever national cham- pion. _____ m Bucknellian File Photo Tom Marchetti '91 receives East Coast Conference championship trophy last year in Davis Gym . Head Wrestling Coach Bob Ferraro knew he had recruited a spe cial athlete in Tom Marchetti when the Easton Area High School student signed to attend Bucknell. Wrestling as a 145-pounder in high school, the National Honor Society member compiled a career record of 79-16-1, as a three-time letter winner. Coach Ferraro believed that even his nu merous individual honors, including twice being a district runner-up, a regional champion and, in 1987, the 145-pound Pennsylvania Interscho lastic Athletic Association state runner-up, did not do the wrestler's talents justice. "" I believe that Pennsylvania wrestling is the best in the nation and to be the state runner-up to a two- time champion (Scott Hovan, now nationally ranked fifth for the Uni versity o f Pittsburgh), showed Tom's abilities. But Tom had just beaten Hovan two weeks earlier and was injured going into the finals. Just to make it that far with bruised ribs is quite an accomplishment."" At the top of Marchetti's list of goals when arriving at Bucknell was becoming an All-American. To accomplish this, he would have to finish the season as one of the top eight wrestlers in the nation, and his freshman season left no doubt that this was attainable. Hardly missing a beat in making the transition to college wrestling, as well as a new weight (167 lbs.), Marchetti posted the sec ond best freshman record in school history, 21-7, including six victories by pin. His performance led the Amateur Wrestling News, America's authority on college wrestling, to name him to the 1988 Freshman All- America Squad. Despite this rookie season recognition, few envisioned what Marchetti was to accomplish the following year. He completed a successful regular season campaign before sweeping through the East Coast Conference Championships to earn his first individual conference title. All of Bucknell's five champi ons earned berths at the N C A A Championships and it was there, in Oklahoma City, that Marchetti sur prised the wrestling establishment. Unseeded, he won all three of his matches in the preliminary rounds, two by pin, to reach the quarterfinals. Once there, Marchetti topped Jam es M adison' s Rob Milavsky, securing his status as the first Bucknell wrestler to be an All- American. He finished the compe tition in fourth place, the only sophomore and unseeded wrestler to reach that high in the final standings. According to Marchetti, this success was the worst that could have happened to his career. ""My goal coming to Bucknell was to be an All-American. I did that too early and I lost sight of the path during my junior year."" While he may have been dis appointed with his performance in 1990, he hardly put up disappoint ing statistics. Ranked most of the season as the number two 167- pounder in the nation, behind Dan St. John of Arizona State, Marchetti finished the year tied with Ed Curran '88 for the most victories (29) in a season by a Bucknell wrestler. He closed the season with his second consecutive conference champion ship, winning the coaches award for being the outstanding wrestler in the tournament, before falling one vic tory shy o f repeating as an A ll- American. As impressive as his three other seasons have been, Marchetti's senior year could turn out to be his most outstanding. Throughout 1990-91, the Bison co-captain has set school records for victories in a season (31) and a career (106), as well as pins in a season (18) and a career (40)'. '""He and 190-pound fel low co-captain Bryan Bums '91 be came the third and fourth Bucknell Bucknellian File Photo Tri-captain Tom Marchetti '91 has dominated numerous opponents, including this Rider wrestler, during his illustrious career at Bucknell. The Easton, PA native is currently ranked eighth in the nation by Amateur Wrestling News, America's authority on college wrestling. wrestlers of all-time to win three consecutive conference crowns, and Marchetti is currently ranked eighth in the nation. It appears as though finishing with that status would not satisfy the senior. His lone goal heading to the N C A A 's in Iowa City is not just to repeat as an All-American, but rather to win Bucknell's first ever national championship. "" Shoot for the stars and you'll land on the moon,"" he recites, "" I feel that it's within my reach. I've lost to the top seed (Mark Reiland of Iowa) by just two points and to the sixth (G.T. Taylor of Arizona State) in overtime."" As excited and prepared as Marchetti is for the challenge, he does not seem concerned about the impending end of his college career. When asked of his plans following"
Ahrens and Co. lead Bison,
"sluggers over VMI, Radford","By Jon Terry The 1991 Bucknell base ball squad left the state of Virginia last weekend with a successful 2-1 road trip. Last Friday, the Bison erased a 7-1 deficit in Lexington to defeat the Virginia Military Institute 12-8. The key to Bucknell's first win of the year was the longball. Four Bison-- Roger Ahrens '91, Mark Kennedy '92, Dave Koerner '92, and Jim Zervanos '92-- hit home runs in a game that was called due to darkness after eight innings. Dan Krewson '91 picked up the win in relief. The following day Buck nell split a doubleheader at Radford. In game one, the Bison were stymied by Radford lefty Chris Connolly, who allowed just four singles in his seven inning complete game, win ning 9-1. In game two, however, the Bison bats awakened once again, turning a 7-3 deficit into a 9-8 win. Mike Kearns '93 (3 for 3 ,2-run HR), Larry Trout '93 (2 for 4, HR, 2 RBI), and Ahrens (2 for 4, HR, 3 RBI) led the attack, while Jim Stevens '94 pitched two innings of solid relief fra' the win. The outlook for the 1991 season is a bit hazy at this moment. Nine players have been lost from last year's 13-20 team due to graduation. Am ong them is shortstop Joe Markulike, who set 17 Bucknell in dividual offensive records last year. He played professionally for the Idaho Falls Braves in the Pioneer League this past summer. This leaves the Bison ex tremely young, with only two se niors in the starting lineup-- first baseman Ted Obligado and out fielder Roger Ahrens. Co-captain Kennedy, leadoff hitter Kearns, out fielder Steve Gyimesi '93, as well as the two seniors appear ready to lead what should be a potent hitting at tack. The missing link at this point is Coach Gene Depew ' s pitching staff, which appears ques tionable. Last year' s leading hurler, Kurt Waldener '93, is out indefinately with shoulder prob lems. Two other sophomores, Denis M aguire and Jack Kazanjian, along with senior Mike Rizzi, make up the current starting rotation. So far this year, Bison starters are averaging just three innings per outing, and the team ERA  is a as tronomical 6.14. Krewson (5 IP, 3 hits, 8 strikeouts) appears ready to either lead the bullpen or be pro moted to starter. While this year's staff shows potential, they will have H H life S P m U _ m H P P P m il riSHMMPMS the trip to Iowa, the 21-year old quickly answers that he will "" forget about wrestling forever,"" but upon consideration he retracts that by say ing ""Once you are away from this sport for awhile, you start to miss it. I'm sure that I'll come back soon."" After his graduation in June, the ac counting major has a job waiting for him in Short Hills, N J, at the ac counting firm of Pete Marwick & Co. But all of that seems very dis tant now. His concentration and tal ents are focused towards the task at hand, victory in Iowa City. Coach Ferraro likes the wrestler's chances. "" His major strength is that he is unorthodox. He has the ability to take an opponent to his back from many different posi tions. His pin records show this ability and that is what makes him so successful. I think he has a great chance to be an All-American again and realistically he has the potential to win it all, as long as he wrestles smart and doesn't make any mis takes."" >> As difficult as it may be, a national championship appears a very possible conclusion to the ca reer of one of the best ever to com pete for the Bison. to improve in order to make the solid offense hold up. The Bison open up their home schedule tomorrow with a doubleheader against Franklin and Marshall. Fifteen of Bucknell's next seventeen games are at home, in this, the team's inaugural season in the Patriot League."

Men's swimming returns,
from Eastern regionals,"By Mitch Benton Staff Writ>> In the final competition of their 1990-91 season, four members of Bucknell's Men's Swimming and Diving Squad swam in the Eastern Regional Championships. The re gional meet, held last weekend at Princeton University, was domi nated by the host school. Princeton finished on top with a total of 645 points and was trailed by Harvard, with 547.5 points, and Penn State, with 478. These three schools, tra ditionally dominant in eastern swimming, also comprised the top three in the Women's Eastern's, held Feb. 21-23. Bucknell's foursome amassed 9.5 points over the three days, rank ing them 23rd in the competition. At last year's championships, held at West Point, NY., the team finished 20th, totaling 39 points. Leading the Bison in Princeton was sophomore sprinter Jay Gross, who competed in three individual events, including the 50 and 100 yard freestyle and the 100 yard butterfly. Gross' top perfor mance came in the 100 free in which he finished eighth with a time of 46.04, the second fastest time in school history, behind only Jim Harvey's 44.37 set in 1988. Also competing in individual events was Don Steenson '92, who swam in the 100 and 200 yard back stroke. Steenson teamed with Gross, Chad Farrell '92 and Kevin Schroth '92 in two relays as well. The 200 yard medley relay team finished 15th, with a time of 1:35.35. Al though the 400 yard medley relay finished 18th in the standings, their time of 3:28.10 was the best this year and the fourth best of all-time. All four of the swimmers who went to Princeton will return next year to guide the Bison men's swimming and diving team, as they try to better this year's third place conference finish and 1-10 regular season record."

"It really is this easy That's why President Bush hopes that, together, we can",
make America m ote fuel independent. DO YOUR PART. DRIVE SMART. ^5!,"The United States Department of Energy '*n.v / / I By Kirk Peters Staff Writer The men's basketball team saw its season come to an end last Friday evening, when they lost to the Fordham Rams for the third time this season in the semi-finals of the Pa triot League tournament. The team finished the year with an overall record of 18-13 and a conference record of 7-5. ""Seventeen wins was some thing we talked about at the begin ning of the season,"" remarked As sistant Coach Terry Conrad. ""We had a good year."" The Breakin' Bison's final game was much like their previous two encounters with Fordham. The Rams got hot early, jumping out to a 24-10 lead behind Fred Herzog and Patriot League Player of the Year Damon Lopez, who was named Sports Illustrated Player of the Week for his efforts in the tourney. The Bison, however, refused to let that early run end the game. Paul Olkowski '93 kept Buckncll close with 10 points in the first half. Colin Bridgewater/The Bucknelllan Mike Bright '93 waits for a rebound with Fordham's Damon Lopez during the Bison's 82-76 Patriot League Championship Semi-final loss in Worchester, MA. Lopez was named the tournament's MVP. Olkowski scored on a variety of shots, including a key three-pointer and a tough reverse lay-up. The Bison, who had been down by at least seven for most of the half, cut the lead to five with 40 seconds left as Russ Peyton '93 hit a lay-up created by a Mike Bright '93 steal. Lopez, however, destroyed any momentum Bucknell had gen erated with a dunk at the buzzer. Lopez finished the half with 13 points and $125 in back rent for his residence in the offensive lane. The Bison remained resilient in the second half. Fordham ex tended its lead to twelve points at 49- 37 before the Bison made their best run of the game. Over the next 5:29, Bucknell went on a 14-4 spurt to cut Fordham's lead to only two points. Keith Fenton '91, Bright, and Bill Courtney '92 all hit key three-point ers during that stretch. The Bison's run forced the Rams to call a time-out to regroup. They regrouped well, and quickly built their lead back to seven points. During that stretch, junior guard Jean Prioleau devastated Bucknell the with his sharp shooting from the outside when the Bison double- teamed Lopez down low. Bucknell managed another mini-run to cut the lead to four points with 1:35 left, but they could never catch the Rams, who went on to win 82-76. All five Bison starters finished the game scoring in double figures, but the Rams got 26 points from Lopez, 23 from Prioleau, and 21 from Herzog to finish of Bucknell. Bill Courtney lead Bucknell with 15. ""It's always disappointing to lose. We came in thinking we could win,"" remarked co-captain Fenton, ""but when it happens against a team as good as they are its easier to take."" Fordham went on to win the tournament in an overtime thriller against Holy Cross. The Crusaders had erased a 14-point deficit when Lopez sat down with four fouls, but lost when Prioleau drilled a three- pointer at the end of the first over time. The Rams went on to be upset"
Lady Bison conclude their,
season with first round loss,"By Todd Bianchine Staff Writer The women's basketball team concluded what has been a rough season last Friday as they bowed out in the first round of the Patriot League tournament to Fordham 103- 75. The loss dropped Bucknell's record to 2-24 overall and 1-11 in league play. ""Basically Fordham played as well as they could have played,"" said point-guard Caroline Shantz '91. ""I don't think we expected them to come out with such intensity and they ended up playing real well."" The first six minutes of the game saw the scoring going back and forth with the two teams sharing the lead seven times. After Juliet McGee '93 sank two free throws to give the Lady Bison a 16-15 lead the Lady Rams went on a tear to make sure Bucknell wouldn't get close again. Sparked by accurate outside shooting from forward Kristie Kennedy and sloppy ball handling by Bucknell, Fordham went on 15-4 point run over the next six minutes by Northeast Conference champion St. Francis (Pa.) in the ""play- in""game to earn its first-ever NCAA tournament berth. The Bison de feated the Red Flash 93-80 earlier this season in Lewisburg. Head coach Charlie Woollum told the team that they had no reason to hang their heads, since they were in every game from the pre-season San Juan Shoot-out until the final game against Fordham. Several members of the Breakin' Bison received postseason honors. Pat King '92, and Bright were named to the All-Patriot League second team, and Courtney was selected to the All-League first team. Courtney also broke the single season scoring record set by Greg Legget '90 a year ago, and set a new record for most made free- throws in a season. ""We all really enjoyed playing together,"" said Fenton. ""Bill, in particular, had a great year."" The Bison can already begin to look forward to next year. Con ference powers Holy Cross and Fordham will lose several key play ers to graduation, while the Bison will return four starters, including the three all-league selections. Lehigh also returns four start ers including Bob Krizansky, who finished second in Player of the Year balloting. Fenton, the only senior starter said of his teammates, 'They have a great nucleus coming back. I know those guys will have a terrific season next year."" ________________ Men's 'Tip-Ins"" Bucknell finished 12th in the nation in free throw shooting (,755)...Pat King'92 set the Buck nell single-season FG percentage mark by shooting .676...Mike Bright '93 set a Bison single-sea son steals record with 65 thefts. Colin Brldgewater/The Bucknelllan Co-Captain Bill Courtney '92 penetrates during the first half of last Friday's game against the Rams. Courtney averaged 20 points a game to lead the Bison and the Patriot League. He'll return next season to lead what should be a formidable Bucknell attack that returns three other starters: Mike Bright '93, Paul Olkowski '93, and Pat King '92. Keith Fenton '91, who attempted a Bison single-season record 150 three-pointers, is the lone graduate among the starting five."
Wrestlers end season with,
third place finish at ECWA's,"Bucknelllan File Photo Julie Bachman GR, seen here passing in a game against Princeton earlier this season, is one of two starters whowill be graduating. to grab a 30-20 lead. The Lady Rams got the lead as high as 16 points, but thanks to a late run by Bucknell they went into the locker room up by 7 points at 46-39. ""We felt pretty confident go ing in to the locker room at half after the run,"" said Shantz, ""but we didn't have it in the second half, which has been typical of our play this year."" Bucknell did begin the half looking like they might upset the second-seeded Lady Rams, as they closed the gap to two points on a Kelly Dee '94 jumper with 16:30 left to play. Fordham reserve guard Heather Donlon responded to Dee's jumper by shooting two consecutive three-pointers to push the lead to 8 points at 57-49. Bucknell's shoot ing then deteriorated as they were unable to find the basket, allowing Kennedy and Donlon to take over as they combined for 22 points in the second half. Bucknell went on to shoot only 33 percent from the field. The season wasn't a loss for a few of the players as Julie Bachman GR was named to the Patriot League first team. Bachman averaged 17.6 points and 6.1 rebounds in league play, and also led the league in three- point shooting, hitting 34 of 73 for a .466 percentage. Kelly Dee was named the rookie of the year by the Patriot League. ""Kelly definitely deserves the honor,"" stated Shantz, ""she's the only freshman I've seen who stepped in and made an impact right away. I think it was good for our team to have Julie and Kelly recog nized because it showed we had some good players despite our record."" By Jamie Diaferia Staff Writer The Bison grapplers closed the book on their season with a third place finish in the East Coast Wres tling Association tournament held Friday. Coach Bob Ferraro ex pressed ""mixed emotions"" about the results, despite the fact that Bucknell produced three champions on the day. The team now looks to regroup for next year as they prepare for the loss of their top three wrestlers. The Bison finished with 73 points on the day, third only to Rider with 99, and Central Connecticut State with 83.25. Four other teams finished behind Bucknell. In the past four years, the grapplers have never finished lower than second place. While the finish was some what disappointing, there were a few bright spots, most notably the crowning of three Bison champions. Mike Van Doren '92 (150 lbs.) de feated Dave Robin of Rider 9-1 for the first of four victories against the tough rival Broncs. Tom Marchetti '91 (167 lbs.) defeated Paul Brosin of Rider 5-1 for his third consecu tive championship. Finally, Bryan Bums '91 (190 lbs.) defeated Rich min iiiiilillMWI-- ii 1 1 i iii'ii'WW \m>\ i ii i mi 'i' Scarper of Rider 10-2 for the third consecutive year. All three wrestlers will go to compete in the NCAA's in Iowa a week from Saturday. The Bison also finished with four third place finishes in the tour nament. They included Ben Myers '91 (Heavyweight), Ken Herceg '92 (177 lbs.), Mike Salone '92 (158 lbs.), and Phil Elliot '93 (134 lbs.). Bucknell did not produce any second place finishes. Coach Ferraro was decidedly mixed in his analysis of the tourna ment. ""I felt eight people wrestled very well, but there were also two let-downs."" The team entered the tournament with three top seeds, the three eventual champions. They also had one second seed, Herceg, whose third place finish came after losing to the same wrestler he beat at Cen tral Connecticut weeks earlier. Myers and Elliot were both unseeded wrestlers coming in, while Salone was the third seed. Ferraro maintains that the Bi son were capable of winning the tournament, but that several key losses pointed the team in the wrong direction. ""There were a couple of losses that made winning unrealistic. Chris Ducas ['91] did not wrestle up to his potential after struggling all season, and Herceg lost to a guy he beat earlier."" Ducas was also the defending conference champ enter ing the day. Ferraro continues to look positively on the season, saying, ""This does not put a damper on what we've accomplished. We had a tough schedule, and we would have had to wrestle extremely well for a winning season."" As for next year, the Bison will be losing Marchetti, Bums, and Ducas, three of the best wrestlers Bucknell has seen in recent years. ""Obviously its difficult to lose guys who have set records for most wins [in a career],"" said Ferraro. ""But overall we will be a better team with more balance. We will have several new additions, and we will be young. With a little ex perience we will get stronger as the season progresses."" Next year will also feature some additions to the schedule, in cluding the Lehigh Invitational and the University of North Carolina, a team ranked in the top twenty in the country. The two meets have been added in hopes of raising the stan dards of the Bison wrestling pro gram in future years. Colin Brldgewater/The Bucknelllan Phil Elliot '93, shown here against Rider, finished third at the ECWA championships after being unseeded. The Bison will send three wrestlers to the national championships to be held at the University of Iowa."

Investigation of w om en's,
basketball m ay begin Mon.,"By Jamie Diaferia Staff Writer Nearly two weeks after women's head basketball coach Lori Howard abandoned four play ers in Worcester, Mass., several questions have been raised regard ing Bucknell teams' alcohol policy. Meanwhile, Athletic Director Rick Hartzell has given Howard until Moday to make a decision about her future. The controversy began after Howard refused to allow four play ers a ride on the team bus after their first-round loss in the Patriot League championships. The deci sion, one made in ""poor judge ment,"" according to Hartzell, came after assistant coach Terrie Grieb discovered the alcohol in the four players' hotel room. The current alchol policy states that: ""The university does not support or condone underage drinking."" According to one coach, this policy is understood to be a strict guideline for every team on campus to follow. The confusion for Howard apparently stemmed from the fact that she was unaware of what was standard procedure for such an incident, mainly because one has not been written. Hartzell dis agrees, saying, ""If I was going to write a policy for every single thing that is going to come up, we'd have a book a million pages long. I think that's ridiculous."" When asked whether he thought the other coaches would change their team's policy regarding alcohol violations, Hartzell replied, ""I don't think it will have an effect on other coaches at all. It was just one of those things that happened. A mistake was made. Other coaches"
Phi Psi national selects,
45 for interest group,
Group to be initiated as chapter next semester,"By Andrew Cohen Staff Writer Forty-five students have been selected as the initial ""interest group"" for the recolonization of Phi Kappa Psi fraternity. S. Michael Wallen and Chris Brown, Phi Psi national educational leadership consultants, have been on campus for the past three weeks and have conducted ninety interviews with students interested in recolonizing Phi Psi. The 45 students chosen by Wallen and Brown, led by interest group President Matt Young '92, will have to submit a rccolonization proposal to the Council on Greek life and will be pledges of Phi Psi ""once we're allowed to come back as a chapter next fall,"" said Wallen. Wallen and Brown conducted ""one on one interviews with every one interested,"" and, according to Wallen, ""we discussed what we were offering and we tried to see if that was the same thing the individual was looking for."" Wallen explained that there were four criteria that he and Brown used in selecting from the candi dates. ""We were looking for, first and foremost, academic achieve ment,"" with members ""at or above the all-male grade point average... or at or above the average for their par ticular discipline."" Wallen contin ued explaining this will ""be the case every semester."" The second criterium enu merated by Wallen was ""campus in volvement; we wanted leaders."" Thirdly, Wallen and Brown looked for ""community minded people"" who were involved in Lewisburg and surrounding areas. Finally, Wallen explained that there was ""a philosophical question, and that was what the individual was looking for ... that he wasn't looking for any of the negatives."" Wallen did explain that ""it is obvious that each individual could not have all of these."" He did say that the all-male GPA requirement would be one in which there would only be case-by-casc exceptions. Of the forty-five chosen, there were three exceptions in the interest group, according to Wallen. In order to move toward rec ognition, the interest group has set up a committee structure for both internal and external concerns. Ac cording to Wallen, there are IFC, Panhel, and BSG liaisons from the interest group. Also, the group will educate itself about the history and tradition of Phi Psi. When the group becomes a colony in the fall they will go through a dynamic ""six to eight week educational period"" which ac cording to Wallen, ""is purely an in tellectual process with no chores, tasks, duties, or obstacles."" At the end of the period, the group will take the national exam and, upon passing, be activated. The group will not have a house for the fall semester said Ed"
Philip Roth to give reading,
in honor of former professor,"By Tara Gilligan Staff Writer Every author writes about his past. For Philip Roth '54, contem porary writer, the past includes Bucknell University. Roth, who graduated from Bucknell, will return on Apr. 1 to Bucknell Hall to read excerpts from his latest novel, Pat rimony. The book itself has nothing to do with Roth's college years - it deals with his father's death - but he will give the reading in honor of Mildred Martin, Emerita professor of English, with whom he still keeps in touch. Martin, a professor at Buck nell from 1940 to 1972, taught Roth in two courses. Roth was one of eight students who completed her senior honors seminar, an advanced writing course which she referred to as The Seminar. Roth describes the course, for which he could be ex pected to hand in 60 pages of critical writing each week, in his autobiog raphy, The Facts, as ""the backbone of my undergraduate education."" Even as an undergraduate, Roth was ""already very good,"" have team policies and they follow them. I think it is irrelevant what happened in this incident. Our policy is that you bring your team to contests and you bring them home."" Other coaches were not as confident about the verbal policies they have used in the past. Head soccer coach Craig Reynolds com mented, ""I'll definitely get more detailed about what is acceptable and what is not acceptable by writ ing the rules out."" Another coach agreed with Hartzell, however, stating that a team must know its parameters. ""We've used contracts in the past,"" said the coach, ""but I think it is abundantly clear what the policy is, and it does not need to be written out,"" Head football coach Lou Maranzana also remarked, ""Our policy is 'Don't embarass the team.'"" This rule is understood by all members of the team, he claims. Hartzell explained also that, Dadez, dean of residential life. Dadez did say that there is an ""out side shot for January."" Of more im mediate concern, Dadez explained that ""what we'll have to deal with in the next few weeks is if the group wants to be together, where we will pul them."" Young noted that this is not of primary importance to him since ""we're going to be together, regard less of whether we live together or not, because of meetings and other events."" 'Although Phi Psi is coming back in the fall, Wallen explained that ""recruitment never sleeps. Rush for us is not a formal thing. It is making friends and meeting people, and being very inclusive."" Wallen also noted that chap ter meetings will be open to anyone wishing to attend. ""That's how you learn, by opening up your meetings."" Young added, ""It shouldn't be con ducted in secret; we have nothing to hide."" Both Young and Wallen were positive about the rccolonization and Phi Psi's future role on campus. Young explained, ""I feel very positive about the group of men we have now and I hope we can create our own space within the university and help make the Greek system a little better."" Wallen echoed the sentiment, ""For us, it's a challenge as a fraternity to come back and be the best we can be. We found many men who will carry on our fraternity's name in a fine sense."" Courtesy of Jack W heatcroft Author and former Bucknellian Philip Roth will give a reading from his new novel, Patrimony on April 1 in Bucknell Hall. Ashley Chertkof/The Bucknelllan Athletic Director Rick Hartzell claims that despite the abandonment of four women basketball players by head coach Lori Howard, there is not a need for written University policies for athletic teams. while Howard has yet to make a choice, her decision must come next week at the latest. ""Monday at noon is the time frame with which we talked,"" he said from Louisville on Wednesday. When asked whether this decision would include quitting her position, Hartzell refused to comment. Hartzell said last week that a ""full and in-depth"" review of the basketball team would come in the next month, unless Howard decides to quit before then. While she is to make a decision by Monday, the na ture of that choice is unknown. Howard has refused to comment thus far."
Faculty express concern,
about merit pay system,"Martin said. ""He has always had a wonderful ear for communication, awfully good,"" she said, later de scribing a paper he wrote for The Seminar in which he accurately, and comically, captured the personality of each member of the class. More than thirty years after his graduation from Bucknell, Roth See ROTH, page 5 By Steve Hoerter Staff Writer Controversy over the University's merit based salary sys tem surfaced at last week's faculty meeting. Steve Becker, professor of physics, brought into question the equity and effectiveness of the cur rent system. The issue centers on how many faculty members are given a ""level three"" merit raise, the highest raise category in the system, and whether or not this number has exceeded limits set forth by the fac ulty in the early 1980s. According to Larry Shinn, vice president for academic affairs, ""The percentage of faculty receiving an extraordinary rating has been moving up very slowly."" Shinn added that the criteria for determin ing who receives a level three raise have likewise been strengthened. ""The standards really have gone up,"" Shinn said. In 1990, according to Shinn, the percentage of faculty re ceiving level three raises was in the mid-twenty percent range. In 1984 the figure was approximately five percentage points lower. There are three different lev els of merit that are used in the sys tem: satisfactory (level one), meri torious (level two) and very merito rious (level three). The difference between the categories, while not specifically spelled out in any Uni versity document, is determined by an evaluation of each professor's activities during the previous three year period. The evaluation process begins with the presentation of the professor's vita to his or her depart ment chair. Vitae generally contain student evaluations, published ar ticles and written justification for merit level placement. The depart ment chair then makes a merit pay recommendation to the either the Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences or the Dean of the College of Engineering, depending upon which College the department is in. These two recommendations are then passed on to the Council of Deans, composed of both Deans and the Vice President for Academic Affairs, Larry Shinn. This council collectively makes the final deci sion. According to Shinn, approxi mately 50 percent of the recom mendations are for level three raises, of which approximately 25 percent are granted. The merit pay system is supplemented by an across the board raise that generally reflects cost of living adjustments (COLAs). Theo retically, all faculty salaries are ad justed for inflation in addition to a merit raise of some sort. Becker asserts that in 1980, when the current merit based salary system was introduced by Richard McGinnis, professor of civil engi neering, quotas were assigned to the number of faculty permitted in each category of merit. Faculty meeting minutes from the time period do use the term ""quota"" -- the current in terpretation of the term by Shinn has been ""a guideline to be taken seri ously."" According to a document cir culated to all faculty members in November of last year, guidelines exist for the percentage of faculty that should be placed in each cat egory. According to this document, the satisfactory category ""may con tain 5 to 10% of the faculty,"" the meritorious level 75 to 80% and the very meritorious level ""not less than 10% nor more than 20% of the fac ulty."" The Board of Trustees gener ated the initial push for the imple mentation of a merit salary system in the late 1970s, according to Becker. Richard Henry, professor of physics and a member of the Com mittee on Personnel during the time, recalls the debate surrounding the initial proposal. ""The trustees said you've got to have a merit system. And [the current system] was a way of ducking it."" In response to the push, the faculty's Committee on Personnel began work on a proposal that would satisfy both the Board's concerns and the faculty's concerns. The result was the McGinnis proposal made in late 1980, which is still in use today. In an interview yesterday, McGinnis said, ""My plan was a one year plan."" However, in 1981 the faculty voted to continue with McGinnis' plan. McGinnis' proposal was not for a full merit system, one in which all raises would be based on merit ratings, but was rather for one in which merit raises were added to COLAs. In an interview Wednesday, Becker said, ""The faculty and administration es sentially agreed to a system...that isn't a meritorious system, because most of the faculty were supposed to fall in the middle category."" Becker believes that the ad ministration is simply ignoring the quotas set forth by the faculty in 1980. This increase in the number of faculty in the level three category, according to Becker and other fac ulty members, yields a heightened sense of competition within a de partment. ""Colleagues cease to be colleagues -- they become com petitors,"" Becker said. Michael Moohr, professor of Economics and chair of the depart ment, sees the entire system in a somewhat different light. ""We haven't liked the merit pay system because it calls into question one's professionalism. If we were moti vated by money we would not have chosen this profession,"" Moohr said in an interview earlier this week. The department of economics, as a result, asks to be judged collec tively, according to Moohr. He said, ""We've always asked to be judged collectively; wc see ourselves as a department. We're not freelancers."" Shinn's outlook is a bit differ ent, ""I personally do not see the merit system as a motivating system, rather a recognition system."" Ac cording to McGinnis, the difference between a level two and level three raise amounted to about $400 in 1990. See MERIT PAY, page 2"

"Washers, dryers made",
tamper-resistant,"By Mark Leister Staff Writer University washers and dryers were recently made tamper-proof in order to prevent illegal operation of the 102 coin-operated machines. The physical plant requested the modifications after discovering that people were tampering with the machines so they would operate without coins. According to Bob Millward, manager of buildings, the University lost nearly $8,000 in washer and dryer income last year, an abrupt change from the $9,000 and $ 13,000 increases for each of the two prior years. It was not until early January that the physical plant staff was able to determine the method by which people were cheating the machines. At that point, physical plant con tacted Diehl's TV and Appliances, which supplies and maintains the machines for the University. Diehl's informed Millward that replacing the coin mechanisms would cost $16 per machine, a price the physical plant was un willing to bear. Instead, the Uni versity opted to modify the existing mechanisms at a cost of $7 per machine. Millward stated that Diehl's agreed to perform the nec essary work and accept half of the cost. According to Millward, modifications began in mid-Febru ary and all of the washers and dry ers will be tamper-resistant by the end of March. Though tampering problems have been reported at some local universities, the situation appears to be college specific. According to Bill Kurtz, manager of Diehl's, his company's problems with machine tampering have been confined to the Bucknell campus. In-town laundries have re portedly remained unaffected. For example, Julie Jasiewics, co-owner of Wash Tubs Laundries, a self- service Lewisburg establishment which owns machines similar to Bucknell's, has noticed no signifi cant losses."

Campus furniture theft,
reaches all,"By Elizabeth Danneberg Staff Writer In the past year, Bucknell has suffered from more university fur niture theft than ever. Such items as chairs, lamps, bean bags, and loveseats, have continually been stolen from Roberts, Larison, and Harris Halls, the Bertrand Library and other buildings. Many times this furniture is temporarily ""bor rowed"" from students, only to show up back in place during breaks when rooms are checked. Library furniture, however, is usually not returned to its place vol untarily. For example, just recently, four bean bags and a globe stolen from the library, were found in the halls and library of Hunt Hall, soon after custodians had told residents that security officers would be checking the premises. In addition, last Saturday night, two chairs were taken from the after hours section of the library only to be found two days later outside the library. When asked of her opinion of the recent library thefts, Joanne Young, associate director for library services, commented that, ""We in the library want to provide the kind"
-time high,"of facility that students like to have. Students seem to like an informal atmosphere, so it is unfortunate that a few made it uncomfortable for the whole."" Young also said that it is lack of consideration for other stu dents that is most distressing to her. Though numerous pieces of furniture have been stolen from residence hall lounges, affecting many students, Gerry Commerford, assistant dean for housing, says that Bucknell is not going to replace the furniture. ""We can't keep pouring money down the drain. Students are often quick to complain about the cost of Bucknell, so in order to keep the cost down, the students them selves must make sure things stay in place,"" said Commerford. He added that in a case such as the basement of Harris Hall, where all the furniture has been stolen, the room will remain empty. Commerford suggested that empty rooms may be used for other pur poses in the future. According to the Office of Security and Safety, those who have been found in possession of University property are subject to disciplinary action and/or arrest."
Merit pay,"From page 1 According to Barry Maxwell, vice president for administration and former dean of the college of engi neering, departments are not forced to participate in the system. There fore, not all departments take part in the process. Henry, while in favor of the merit system, said, ""I don't like it when too many people get the top merit unit."" In an interview this week, Henry likened the potential situation to grade inflation. ""If fifty percent of the students in a class get A's the other fifty percent is going to begin to wonder why they didn't get A's too."" According to several professors interviewed, with an in crease in the number of faculty in the level three category the boundaries become blurred. Becker queried, ""How do you measure it? What does it mean?"" McGinnis, addressing the small percentage increase of faculty in level three, said, ""If that's all we've done in ten years, we've done a great job at holding the line."" He added, ""I'd like to see more of a fi nancial difference [between levels two and three]."" Shinn defended the system in an interview last night. ""At most in stitutions merit increases are given every year to all faculty. Often they have two, three, four, even five cat egories. We only have three catego ries."" Accounting for the slow in crease of faculty in the level three category he added, ""What I see coming down the road is a very strong, young faculty."" Shinn said, ""It may well be that the faculty per sonnel committee will want to ad dress this issue."" Editor's Note: Staff Writer David Murray contributed to this report."

BYOB policy nears implementation,
Social changes inevitable,"By Charlie Collier ""The social patterns on the Bucknell campus have to change"" according to Denis Maguire '93, president of the Inter-fraternity Council (IFC). This change is nei ther the sole decision of the IFC nor the University; rather it is the pres sure from some fraternities' national ^organizations to move to a ""Bring Your Own Beer"" (BYOB) policy that is forcing Bucknell to consider how its social life must change as :early as next semester. ""The social scene will change dramatically"" according to Michael Powers '92, president of Delta Up silon fraternity. 'The party scene is going to move from big blow-outs on Friday and Saturday nights to smaller mixer-type parties."" He also noted that ""people are going to party in their rooms a lot more and earlier. Big weekends like House Party Weekend might be less emphasized or big parties might even disappear if things work out the way they look like they might."" The proposed policy shift is of concern to sororities as well as fra ternities. Kristine Elliott '92, presi dent of the Panhellenic Council (Panhel), shares the opinion that ""people are going to try and drink more elsewhere and then go up to the houses even more drunk than be fore."" Noting the policy is not all bad however, she admitted ""there are pros and there are cons to it."" A BYOB policy will serve the purpose of ""making each person responsible for their own drinking,"" which re lieves some of the burden from those organizations who are presently the sole providers of alcohol. When asked if a policy like BYOB can be effective on our cam pus, Elliott noted that ""it will defi nitely increase the amount of re sponsibility that fraternities and so rorities have to take during the party to monitor what's coming in and what's leaving."" Powers added that whether BYOB works or not is ""not our decision to make right now. We are being dictated to by the insurance companies through our nationals on how we are going to have to do these things."" The consensus seems to be that BYOB must work if fraternities wish to exist as nationally recog nized organizations on this campus. Other schools, among them"

STORE,"the University of Pennsylvania, have already tried a BYOB policy, said Powers, but Penn is one of the schools where it is unsuccessful. ""They've gone BYOB, and offi cially they are BYOB, but it's not working there. Eventually what's going to happen is that charters are going to be pulled and houses are going to be in severe trouble"" re marked Powers. What all of this seems to mean is that social change is on the way whether the IFC, the University, or the students necessarily want it or not. ""I think we're going to struggle socially for a while but once we get in a routine with the BYOB policy where nobody knows the difference, then I see some positive things going on in terms of the social life on campus"" said Maguire. Everyone made it clear that they want no one to be surprised by what seems to be this inevitable change. Jennifer Shore '92, Panhel public relations chairperson, explained that ""people have to know when they leave in June, that when they come back at the end of August BYOB is the way it is going to be."""
IFC debates campus future,"By David Murray StaffWriter The members of the Inter-fra ternity Council (IFC) debated the future of a ""Bring Your Own Beer"" (BYOB) policy on campus at their meeting Tuesday night. The policy is being brought about mainly be cause of pressure from the fraterni ties' national organizations. According to Ed Dadez, asso ciate dean of residential life, many national fraternity organizations purchase liability insurance from the Fraternity Insurance Purchasing Group (FIPG) or from a similar plan. A new risk management policy, adopted by FIPG-type insurance companies, stipulates that ""no alco holic beverages may be purchased through the chapter treasury nor may the purhease of same for members or guests be undertaken or coordinated by any member in the name or on behalf of the chapter."" Two chapters that do not fall under these guidelines are Sigma Chi and Kappa Sigma. While the Sigma Chi national organization does purchase FIPG insurance for its chapters which want it, the Bucknell chapter of Sigma Chi is not under written by the national or by FIPG. Similarly, Kappa Sigma does not purchase insurance from FIPG. While the official IFC BYOB policy is not yet finalized, discussion at Tuesday's meeting centered on the policy's implementation. Sev eral fraternity representatives ex pressed concern that the two non- FIPG fraternities might face a diffi cult choice: abide by the IFC BYOB regulations or maintain the freedom they have in being separate from"
FIPG.,"In response to the Council's concern, Sigma Chi's president, Mark Pascarella '92 stated that his fraternity is ""willing to fully cooper ate because other houses are re quired to do so as well."" He was cautious, however, stating ""I don't want to see wholesale concessions that are mandated by other fraterni ties' individual insurance policies. We need equity and parity"" in the policy. Similarly, Pete McNally'93, president of Kappa Sigma, an nounced that his fraternity would also support an IFC BYOB resolu tion ""if we deem the details reason able."" Denis Maguire '93, IFC president, is worried about a poten tial split in the IFC between those fraternities required to change to a BYOB policy and those who are not not required to change. ""I hope they do follow the IFC policy and create as little contro versy as possible,"" Maguire said. He recognized that the two fraterni ties were ""in a tough situation,"" but he said ""the houses should be equal on this campus and under one rule; and by next semester, BYOB is go ing to be that rule."""

Soviets to hold,
referendum,"As the March 17 referendum nears, rallies have occurred in sev eral Soviet cities this week. More than 100,000 people marched through Moscow on Monday de manding Mikhail Gorbachev's res ignation and supporting a "" no"" vote in the referendum on Sunday. The referendum will ask So viet voters, "" Do you support the preservation of the Union as a re newed federation of sovereign re publics in which the rights of a per son o f any nationality are fully guaranteed?"" These rallies have turned Sunday's referendum into a face-off between President Gorbachev with his group of Communists, centrists, and conservatives, and the liberals, nationalists, and reformers who have supported Boris Yeltsin, the leader o f the Russian Republic. With thousands of Soviets participating in rallies, the growing opposition be tween these two groups and their leaders has become more and more noticeable. Even though Mr. Yeltsin has insisted that he has no desire to re place Mr. Gorbachev as the Soviet president, Mr. Yeltsin has called for Mr. Gorbachev's resignation, for a dissolution o f central powers, and for a rapid introduction of a free market."
Policy to break,
apartheid,"South African President F. W. de Klerk introduced legislation to abolish all racial discrimination in land ownership. This new law, which is one of the most significant steps taken to break down the barri ers of apartheid, allows South Afri cans to live where they choose. Under old laws, nearly 87 per cent of the country's land has been reserved for South Africa's white minority o f S million which now constitutes about 13 percent of the total population of about 37.S mil lion. The new legislation, which is expected to be approved by the end of June, should put an end to resi dential segregation and set right the inequality in land ownership be tween the country's black majority and its white minority. Although four old laws are to be repealed and this new policy in stated, the new legislation has failed to offer any restitution to an esti mated 3.5 million black South Afri cans who were dispossessed during the last three decades by white mi nority governments. These blacks can only go home if they buy back the property from which they were evicted."

Serbia gives in,
to protesters,"Serbia, Yugoslavia's largest republic, gave in Wednesday to the three-day protest led by anti-Com- munist demonstrators in Belgrade. After an estimated crowd of 100,000 filled the capital's downtown area earlier this week, the Yugoslav gov ernment acceded to the major de mands of the protesters. The government agreed to dismiss the directors of the televi sion station who the protests had held responsible for what they called propagandist news programs. In ad dition, it gave in to the protests of the students by releasing Vuk Draskovic, head o f the nationalist Serbian Renewal movement, from prison where he had been since he organized the initial mass protest on Saturday. Even though student leaders are satisfied with these actions taken by the government, many in the crowd declared that they would stay in Belgrade until Y ugoslavia' s President Milosevic and his party had been forced from power."
Exxon to plead,
guilty in oil spill,"The Exxon Corporation has decided to plead guilty to criminal charges stemming from the 1989 Exxon Valdex oil spill. Exxon will pay an immediate $100 million fine, the largest criminal fine ever paid for pollution, to settle charges brought by the Department of Justice. This fine o f $100 million is only part of the $1.1 billion Exxon may pay in restitution over the next ten years to settle civil and criminal cases arising from the nation's laig- est oil spill almost two years ago. This settlement would end the major suits brought against the company by the State of Alaska and the United States, but in all there are still some 330 separate suits pending against Exxon. This restitution has arisen on account of the March 24,1989 acci dent when nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil spilled from the hull of the Exxon Valdez after the tank ran aground in the Prince W illiam Sound. A portion of this money will be used for scientific studies of the sound which suffered great damage from the spill and for projects to"
Gettysburg tests,
BYOB policy,A  new B Y O B  policy was tested last Friday night at Gettysburg College. An estimated crowd of 500 attended the all-campus party held in Gettysburg's gym . The party marked the first time that the college's current BYO B  policy was practiced. The new BYO B policy allows for those 21 and over to bring six 12- ounce beers into a party and leave them in coolers until they want them. Some stipulations to the new policy include that parties must be under 250 people and that the hosts of the party must go through the Alcohol Education class and a new class on how to spot fake IDs.

As a result of these budgetary constraints, ad ministrative vacancies have been forced to remain empty. The position o f director of continuing education has been va cant for one year; the position of as sistant Academic Dean has been va cant for almost two years; and the position of assistant director o f aux iliary services has been vacant for the past three years. It is not that these positions have been eliminated entirely but that the Pitt-Johnstown campus does not have the money to hire anyone to fill them. It is ex pected that these positions will re main vacant until such a time when its budget situation improves."

US Jobless rate,
rises to 6.5%,"The unemployment rate rose to its highest point in four years dur ing February reaching 6.5 percent. The jobless rate was up from 6.2 percent in January. This increase of three-tenths of one percentage point put 450,000 individuals out of work in February. For the second time in two months, the Federal Reserve re sponded to the worsening recession by lowering interest rates another notch. By cutting interest rates, it hopes to increase borrowing and thereby generate economic growth through increased spending by com panies and individuals. Even though the Bush administration predicts the economy may pull out of the reces sion by late spring or early summer, this move by the Federal Reserve, in addition to many economists' views, show otherwise."
Low-fat burger,
has real beef,"McDonald's intends to make a hamburger that is lower in fat avail able in restaurants on April 26. This is the first low-fat hamburger offered at any fast-food chain nationwide to use real beef. This low-fat burger which has been called the McLean Deluxe uses a new process that substitutes water for some of the fat This process re duces the level of fat in the ham burger to 9 percent which is halftime level of the company's larger ham burgers, like the Quarter Pounder. The low-fat hamburger would be offered in addition to McDon ald's other burgers. It will probably have about 310 calories and be served without cheese and with a low-fat mayonnaise dressing. It is expected to sell for about the same price as the M cD.L.T. McDonald's reason for its in troduction of the low-fat hamburger is to counter sluggish sales and vari ous growing criticisms of its food. In addition, this is only one of many attempts by the fast-food industry to heed consumer concerns about fat and cholesterol. 1 m r i n - n - r ;1"

WVBU radio show plays prisoners' requests,"By Susan Smith Radio request and dedication shows have always been a popular, yet personal way of expressing feel ings, but to the men at the Lewisburg Federal Penitentiary and the women at the M uncy State Prison, the "" Prison Request Show"" on W VBU ^  according to one of the inmates '\he part in life that helps to keep bdance and focus."" (see letter in : sitebar) Every Sunday from 3:30 p.m. . to (p.m ., inmates at these two pris on^ anxiously tune radios into WVBU to listen to D J ""Morgan"" (an assured air-name) read their letters and flay that week's requests. .

Bison Tales,"By Vare Haimes StaffW liter Okay, we were discussing the Official List O f the Top 100 Mott Desirable Traits That People Latk For, and the two top ranked M OST desirable character ele ments are... Mystery and Novelty These two traits have re cently climbed to the top of the ciarts as a result of cheesy teenage movies that convinced us (during our adolescent years) to believe that somewhere out there is the "" perfect person."" According to these flicks, this ideal mate will not be some boring 'friend' who you have pleasant daily conversations with, but rather a mysterious and novel stranger who you've never, ever talked to before in your life. Remember "" Sixteen Cand les?"" It's the movie in which a sensitive, decent girl (Samantha) decides on her 16th birthday that she's in love with a "" mysterious"" senior guy named Jake who re sembles M r. America. W ell, as Hollywood would have it, the guy turns out to be romantic and sincere ?nd wonderful and charming AN D enamored of Samantha. The movie triumphantly ends when Jake gives the heroine her flowered underwear back, bakes her a birthday cake, and drives her away to his mansion in a snappy red car. By the way, they live happily ever after. The Theme: If you are a sensitive, de cent female, "" mysterious"" Gor geous Hunks will also be pleasant and smart and will immediately decide that they love and respect you and bake you cakes....from scratch. Another popular teen ro mance movie was "" Karate Kid,"" in which an honest and sincere short guy named Daniel has a secret crush on some beautiful yet elusive girl named Bambi who dates a monosyllabic, Neanderthal who communicates primarily by using ; the expression, "" uhhhh."" In the movie, after Daniel confesses his total love for Bambi, she says something like, "" Oh D aniel, Y ou 're so honest and sincere! You're just swell!! 1 don't know what I ever saw in Biff. It's you that I R E A L L Y  love!!!"" And the two stroll off hand in hand to go play miniature golf. The Theme: If you are honest, sincere, and short, with no sign of facial hair, attractive females who are also compassionate and intelligent (and have names that end in i) will jump at the chance to be your eternal love slave. Then you'll learn Kung-Fu and beat the hell out o f her ex boyfriend. But in real life, the climatic confrontation between Daniel and Bambi might have gone more like this... Daniel: I don't understand what you see in Biff?!? How can you even hold a normal conversa tion with him? Bambi: He's so mysterious. I want to be the one to ""bring him out of his shell"" and make him "" open up!"" Daniel: He's not mysterious he's an idiot!!! The only thing he knows how to say is, ""uhhhh!"" Bambi: Yes, but he uses it so brilliantly to make his point! .......... Oh by the way, thanks for the roses and the candies and the cake you baked me... from scratch that was really ""nice"". You're like a brother to me, but, frankly you're a geek. Give me a call in a few years when you reach puberty. Okay, suppose you are one of those people who has given up wading through shallow B-movie- archetype impressionists in search for "" mystery"" and has actu ally found someone you can relate to on a human level. Have you won? Have you succeeded? Are the sleepless nights and feelings of confusion and insignificance over? Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha NO Find out why in Dating Game Lame part HI. . . ""MIND GAMES!"""

Roth,"From page 1 continues to keep in touch with Mar tin through telephone calls, mail, and the occasional visit. It is this friend ship which prompted Roth to contact Jack Wheatcroft, professor of En glish, to schedule the reading of Patrimony, in honor of Martin. ""Generously Philip called me one morning and said he'd like to come to Bucknell and do a reading from Patrimony as a tribute to Mildred Martin,"" said Wheatcroft, who began teaching English during the time Roth attended Bucknell. When Wheatcroft arranged for Roth to do the reading in Bucknell Hall, he left out one thing: telling the 86-year-old Martin that the pro gram is in her honor. "" I haven't told her that yet No, I think I'll wait until the posters are out. She'll find out sooner or later,"" he said. No doubt, Martin will approve of the selection. "" I think [ Patrimony ] is the best book he has ever written,"" she said. Martin also likes Goodbye, Columbus, Roth's first book. "" It's rather interesting that for me his earliest and [most recent] are the best,"" she said. In addition, Martin pointed out a favorite passage from The Profes sor o f Desire, published in 1977. Paraphrasing the passage, she said, ""Only in the classroom can there be com plete honesty between the teacher and the students,"" for in the classroom a student can accept criticism as he is unlikely to at any other point in his life. Martin's relationship with the college-aged Roth attests to this statement. But Roth, too, has had plenty of chances to experience the honesty of the classroom. "" He's now at Hunter College, in New York City, and he has been for several years,"" said Martin. Martin said she suspects Roth maintains the same classroom hon esty which he wrote about in The Professor of Desire. "" He likes to teach and he has thought very well about what good teaching is,"" she said. Similar to the attempt at hon esty in the classroom, Roth's novels, I ---------------- too, carry an element o f honesty. Though Roth has been labeled, es pecially in reference to his early works, as anti-Semitic because of his portrayal o f Jew ish people, Wheatcroft would disagree. "" That's nonsense... He writes with honesty and insight I think one of his great themes is the painful process that the Jewish people of his father's genera tion have been going through,"" Wheatcroft said. Those who criticize Roth, calling him an anti-Semitic, are na ive and unsophisticated, Wheatcroft said. 'They don't understand the role of the writer,"" he said. This type of criticism was not anything new to Roth once he began to publish his works. Even during college, Roth endured considerable criticism for his own satirical style. A parody of The Bucknellian, which ran in El Cetera, the literary maga zine Roth edited, shook up what Wheatcroft described as a more pa rochial administration. "" For deliver ing this gleeful one-two punch to an innocuous Bucknell institution I was admonished by the dean of men, Mai Musser, and brought before the Board of Publications for censure,"""
Roth spoofs,
The,
Bucknellian,"During his junior year at Bucknell (1952), Philip Roth was elected editor in chief of Et Cetera, a literary magazine designed to provide a "" sophisticated alterna tive"" to The Bucknellian. The third issue o f the magazine under his direction contained a prolonged spoof of the newspaper and gained him notoriety as a satirist. Follow ing is an excerpt from his autobi ography: The Facts. "" Since The Bucknellian ex emplified for me and my Et Cetera friends the lowbrow campus en thusiasms by which we felt en gulfed, I put asidfe the self-pro tective writing postures with which I had kept my sense of estrange ment in check and launched a heavily sarcastic attack on the ba nality o f the weekly paper and its editor... '"" There is the theory,' began the barrage, 'that if a thousand monkeys were chained to a thou sand typewriters for an unspecified number o f years, they would have written all o f the great literature that has been set down in the world by human beings. If such is the case, what is holding up production on The Bucknellian ? We do not expect Miss Roemer [the editor] and her cohorts to turn out great literature, for, after all, they are not monkeys, but we do expect them to publish a newspaper.' The centerfold of the magazine was a satiric send-up of the newspaper, a facsimile front page burlesquing The Bucknellian' s editorial column and its newsless news stories...' For delivering this gleeful one-two punch to a well-worn, in nocuous Bucknell insliutuion, I was admonished by the dean of men, Mai Musser, and brought before the Board o f Publications for cen sure...Dean Musser talked to me about the meaning of the word tra dition and invoked the "" Bucknell spirit,"" but as I had already heard him express himself on these sub jects on numerous public occasions, I came away from that dressing- down feeling more or less un harmed. My appearance before the student-faculty Board of Publica tions must have been far more try ing, for, as it happens, I don't re member it at all and was only re cently reminded that it took place by my former teacher, Mildred Martin, whose writing tutorial I was taking that semester and whose se nior honors seminar, later, was the backbone of my undergraduate education.,.1 had no recollection of the reprimand from the Board of Publications or of rushing off after ward to be consoled by her. 'Oh, yes,' she told me over the phone [34 years later], 'when you came to my house you were nearly in tears.'"" Editor's Note: The above ex cerpt was reprinted with permis sion from Philip Roth. Copyright Philip Roth. Roth wrote in The Facts. The University's reaction to Roth "" was very much like finding Philip anti-Semitic. Because he was making fun o f The Bucknellian, somehow he was trying to under mine the U niversity,"" said Wheatcroft Martin's response, when he turned to her for advice, was to tell him "" that any satirist in America would be subject to criticism."" [See ""Roth spoofs Bucknell ian,"" this page.] Roth's playful, witty attitude did not always get him in trouble. Once, in order to raise money to fund Et Cetera, Roth and Peter Tasch '54, managing editor, devised a clever scheme. 'They set up a booth at the end of the line at which students registered and paid their fees with a big sign, 'Sign up here for Et Cetera', make your check out to Et Cetera,'"" said W heatcroft. As freshmen reached the end of the line, they simply heeded the sign. "" And so all the freshmen paid their fee for Et Cetera. And that provided the fund ing the magazine needed,"" continued Wheatcroft. Roth recounts some o f his college days in his autobiography. In The Facts, he discusses his transfer to Bucknell from Rutgers Univer sity. He talks about being Jewish in a predominantly W ASP community, about joining the Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity, and about acting in Cap and Dagger productions. Some de tails, such as his sexual relationship with ""the martini-drinking sophisti cate,"" Polly Bates, appear, in dis guised form, in his novels. His return to Bucknell in honor of his former English profes sor is bound to conjure up memories of a time past. As he reads, his words will, as in most of his stories, reflect his own experiences. But they will not concern a time of spritely college carelessness. Patrimony is a reflec tion o f his own father's death. Through Patrimony, the true Philip Roth appears from the shadows of more than a dozen other novels he has written. "" It's a more personal book,"" said Martin. Systeme Biolage. A  natural approach to beauty. A responsible approach to the well-being of our delicate environment."

X1551.,"By Bryan Clark The Department of Theatre and Dance will present the play Un der Milkwood by Dylan Thomas beginning this evening and continu ing through Monday evening at 8 p.m. in Tustin Studio Theatre. The play, by one of the twen tieth century's greatest lyric poets, was originally developed for radio. It has since become a favorite stage play, providing a poetic and humor ous glimpse into the life of a Welsh town from dawn to dark. Thomas focuses on the intimate thoughts and earthy activities of various towns people throughout the day, and threads them together with his lush prose, verse, and song. Director Robert Gainer, Department Chair, adds, ""In this play, Dylan Thomas comically and lovingly parodies the idiosyncrasies of the Welsh towns people."" This production of Under Milkwood provides an unusually high level of opportunity for stu dents, with twenty-four actors por traying over fifty characters. Assis tant Director Penelope Kokines '91 comments on the excitement of working with such a large cast: ""We Photo by Dana Plasse Ensemble members Christine Jerome '91, Katrina Herb '94, Val Marsden '93, Debbie Ragusa '92, Angelique Hawkes '94, Seth Shenghit '92 and George Hannah '93 rehearse a scene from Under Milkwood which will be performed March 15-18 in the Tustin Studio Theatre at 8 p.m. have a community environment in our rehearsals, which leads to a more enthusiastic ensemble perfor mance."" Students have also found op portunities in other areas of produc tion. Kokines has led the ensemble in the development of character through movement, using tech-/ niques she learned from Danna Frangione and Shellie Cash-Mullet/ assistant professors of dance, in trt ourse ""Movement f/r .ctors."" Andrew Garman '91, w/o ;tudicd ""Voice For The Actor"" i j a ear-long course in London, hasled veral voice workshops. Rob Rjcer R has conducted rehearsals ft a elsh hymn which will be per formed on stage by the ensemble. ere will also be two studeni mu sicians on stage throughout tty per formance. David Welliver Gf will play violin, and Dan Janusefci '91 will play flute and keyboard. Perhaps the most unioue as pect of this production is thtt there will be no scenery. The setthg will therefore be suggested tirough lighting, designed by Techiical Di rector Steven Draheim, and through costumes, designed by Director of Theatre F. Elaine Williams. This in teresting approach to the play pro vides an exciting challenge for both actors and designers. Gaiter remarks that, ""Lighting and coitumes are combined with the actor.' talents to reveal the humanity cf a Welsh town."" Tickets may be purctased at the L.C. Box Office for $3.i0. Sun day and Monday are student dis count nights, with tickets at $250 for students with Bucknell I.D."

An die Musik to perform in a,
display of sight and sound,
Tonight's concert of the Weis Center to feature,
paintings and the music that inspired the artists,"By Karen M. Ebersold ""The Painter's Music, the Musician's Art,"" a unique collabo ration between painters and musi cians, will be presented by An die Musik, a quintet of strings, oboe and piano, tonight at 8 p.m. in the Weis Center. The theme of this unique pro gram stems from the obvious con nection between music and art. In 1981, artist Helen Frankenthaler de signed a collage valentine which in cluded a ticket stub from an An Die Musik concert. This valentine be came the inspiration for the col laboration of the Chamber Music group, An Die Musik, and four prominent artists: Helen Frankenthaler, David Hockney, Robert Motherwell, and Kenneth Noland. The idea was to fuse the paintings of these artists with the music that has served to inspire them. Each artist chose a musical piece of special significance to their work, and those pieces will be per? formed against the slides of the re spective paintings, according to William Boswell, director of cultural events. Comments by the painters, drawn from informal conversations about music and its meaning in their lives, will be included in the concert programs. The pieces performed will be: Beethoven's ""Piano Quartet in E-flat Major, Opus 16,"" for Frankenthaler's An Die Musik, Schubert's ""String Trio in B-flat Major, D.471,"" set against Hockney's Amaryllis in Vase, Mozart's ""Quartet for Oboe and Strings in F major, K.370"" for Noland's Noon Afloat, and Mozart's ""Piano Quartet in E-flat minor, K.493,"" set against Motherwell's Cantata XIII.

Isaak is successful with new album,"By Matthew P. Wood Staff Writer Who the hell is Chris Isaak, you may be asking yourself right now. I've been asking the same question for several weeks now since I first heard the song ""Wicked Game."" You've probably heard it yourself, the eerie broken hearted ballad in which the singer bellows out ""I wanna fall in love... with you."" If that doesn't ring a bell, maybe you've seen the black and white video on MTV, with the guitar strumming singer wearing a bizarre dark suit. One thing is for certain, this song sounds like noth ing else on mainstream radio, and that is definitely good. Isaak's success, though seemingly instant, has in fact been long-awaited. He is no newcomer to music at age 34, having pro duced three albums in the last ten years. Would you believe his latest album Heart Shaped World, which contains the hit ""Wicked Game,"" has been available for a year and a half? Having enjoyed ""Wicked Game"" so much, I decided to pro cure a copy of Heart Shaped World. I was shocked by what I heard. In a day of dubbing, pyro technics, and long screeching gui tar solos, Chris Isaak has reverted completely in the other direction, straight back to the traditional, sensuous love song. It's a shame record companies have abandoned this kind of music for what is gen erally flashy trash. Instrumentally speaking, Isaak's music is fairly simple. What undoubtedly makes him so special is his voice and his uncanny ability to combine words into very catchy lyrics. Strong yet fragile, Isaak sings the way you wish you could when you have a broken heart. Another remarkable trait is the consistency of his music. His blend of rock, coun try, and blues is a little different to the avid rock fan, but I never felt the Courtesy of Reprise Record; need to fast-forward through a song on Heart Shaped World. This is most certainly what I refer to as ""mood music."" In other words, you don't put this on to get the crowd going during a big party. Rather, you sit down, relax, and absorb this kind of music. Few satisfy this mood like Chris Isaak does. I highly recommend Heart Shaped World as it will probably be unlike any other album you own."
Weis Center cooks up a treat,
for the ears with Concordia,"Courtesy of Public Relations An die Musik, which includes violist Richard Brice, violinist Richard Rood, cellist Daniel Rothmuller, pianist Constance Emmerich and oboist Gerard Reuter, will present ""The Painter's Music, The Musician's Art,"" a collaboration with four prominent painters. By David Murray Staff Writer If you mix one part history making young conductor, two parts acclaimed, upbeat, eclectic chamber orchestra, and one part world-fa mous, Tony award-winning vocalist, what do you get? You get the Concordia sym phony performing with Judy Kaye in the Weis Center last Saturday night. Their remarkable perfor mance, highlighted by Robert Christianson's 'Tone Poem for the New Age,"" went a long way toward the group's goal of de-mystifying classical music. ""We try to make the music more ac cessible,"" said Marin Alsop, the ensemble's artis tic director. As the concert began, and Alsop stepped up to the microphone po sitioned on her podium, the au dience knew that hers would not be a traditional symphony con cert. ""Many or chestras have a stuffy, museum like approach to symphonic mu sic,"" she told the audience. ""One way we try to combat that is to pro gram exclusively American music. American composers always seem to remember that Americans have a sense of humor,"" said Alsop. Indeed, Concordia's all- American concert featured works by George Gershwin and Aaron Copland, as well as the Pennsylva nia premiere of Robert Christianson's 'Tone Poem for the New Age."" The concert began with Gershwin's ""Overture to Oh, Kay!"" Written in 1926, the piece includes many songs that have become part of the public consciousness. One of the songs, ""Someone to Watch Over Me,"" was even to be performed later in the program by soloist Judy Kaye. The ensemble then performed a Copland work entitled ""Music for the Theatre."" The piece demon strated the talents of the fifty young musicians who make up Concordia. The solo clarinet in the Dance and the haunting piano and winds in the Interlude were incredibly beautiful. Indeed, the group's interpretation of the work was generally delightful. The final measures performed by solo oboe left the audience wishing the piece could go on forever. That feeling was gone in min utes, however, as Alsop introduced Christianson's ""Tone Poem."" Christianson himself was perform ing with the orchestra, playing a Korg Tl, an extremely advanced electronic keyboard programmed with more than a dozen different voices. The piece began with his Courtesy of Public Relations The Concordia Symphony and Broadway singer Judy Kaye per formed under the direction of Marin Alsop Saturday night, keyboard producing the sound of human singing intermingled with celestial chimes. Slowly, the cellos, piano, entire string section, and even an electric bass picked up the theme, and Christianson started modulating his keyboard's voice. After the work's thundering finale, the audience responded with its heartiest applause of the night. The second half of the pro gram began with the introduction of Judy Kaye. Ms. Kaye received the 1988 Tony award for her perfor mance as Carlotta in The Phantom of the Opera, and she has appeared on stage with Rock Hudson, Barry Bostwick, and John Travolta, among others. She first sang ""Old American Songs"" by Aaron Copland. Al though the orchestra occasionally overpowered Ms. Kaye's singing, the piece in general was very enjoy able. Her rendition of 'I Bought Me a Cat,' complete with multiple ani mal noises (including a duck's ""quack"" and a cow's ""moo""), was hilarious! Immediately following 'I Bought Me a Cat,' however, Kay performed a glorious and touching version of 'Simple Gifts.' As she finished, the audience momentarily sat in silence and then applauded appreciatively. The ensemble's final pieces were well-known songs by George Gershwin, with lyrics by Ira Gershwin. After the audience had reminisced to the strains of the clas sic 'Embrace Me, My Sweet Em- braceable You,' Kaye began her best perfor mance of the evening. Fol lowing two verses of 'I Got Rhythm,' she slowly began to sway and step in time with the music. She then started to tap dance on stage, and the audi ence burst into laughter as she played a cowbell, tri angle, and duck call as in dicated in the score. Kaye even pointed at conductor Alsop just as the orches tra recaptured the theme. After Kaye's performance, the orchestra itself began to ap plaud, and Alsop whistled after Kaye as she left the stage. In an in terview after the performance, Alsop said she appreciated Kaye's contribution. ""People like Judy have one foot in both worlds--they can perform both popular and more serious works."" Concordia also attempts to premiere a work by an American composer at each of its concerts. Alsop believes the practice ""con nects us to living music and gives it a sense of relevance."" Additionally, Alsop mentioned that she enjoys performing at colleges and univer sities. ""Most of us are only 30 years old,"" she said. ""I think we're closer to the college students than many other groups."""

Rules should be written in stone,
Athletic Department has much to learn from Howard case,
The Athletic Department's need for a comprehensive policy to govern the actions of stu,
dent athletes and coaches has been highlighted by coach Lori Howard's recent actions.,
"According to Rick Hartzell, director of athletics, ""If I was going to write a policy for every",
"single thing that is going to come up, we'd have a book a million pages long; I think that's",
"ridiculous."" While Hartzell is correct in stating that it would be impossible to specify every rule",
"that coaches and players should follow, the need for a set of general written guidelines is over",
whelming.,
"Howard's abandonment of four women's basketball players in Worcester, Massachusetts",
"was in violation of what Hartzell described as an ""understood"" policy. In essence, the Athletic",
Department has no written policy that would have preempted Howard's actions and no prescrip,
tion for the punishment of such an action. Howard was forced to make a decision on the spot.,
"Should she have called Hartzell at the Atlantic Coast Conference tournament is Charlotte, NC to",
"see how he ""understood"" the policy? Unwritten policies and",
understood,
obligations are simply,
not sufficient and can often be misunderstood.,
"In the Howard incident, the coach served as judge, jury and executioner. A committee",
should be formed to handle all student-athlete infractions so that the coach is not all-powerful.,
"Coaches taking action without review will be in violation of this policy, thus rectifying the prob",
lem without creating a lengthy and cumbersome set of regulations.,
"Furthe^OTe"" every coach should spell out",
in writing,
his or her expectahons for the players.,
that the coach and players understand the policy in the same way. The gray areas,
exist must be clarified.,
In last week's case of the four women's basketball players who were allegedly consuming,
"alcohol, it was unclear whether team policy was still in effect after then final game was",
eluded. A written contract would dispel any speculation.,
"Craig Reynolds, head soccer coach, has the right id e a -''ge.ring more detailed about what",
is acceptable and what is not acceptable by writing the rules out.,"Rick, is"

Reporter rebuts homophobic,
accusations raised in letter,"To the editor: I am writing in response to Margaret Cronin's February 24th letter not to rebut her views on my article on the Lewisburg Peniten tiary in the February 15th edition of The Bucknellian , but to clarify exactly whose opinions were be ing given in the references made in my story to the presence of homosexuality and AIDS within the institution. To begin, Ms. Cronin's let ter read that the article's report ing made an ""intimation that ho mosexuality in prison is an ex ample of the 'countless hardships and loss of basic liberties' that in mates come to 'gradually ac cept'"" Here, it is critical to un derstand that it was the opinion of the inmate that homosexuality presented a difficulty in his day to day life, and that the ""assump tions behind the paragraph,"" as Ms. Cronin wrote, were nothing more than a paraphrasing of the man's beliefs. While I agree wholeheart edly with Ms. Cronin that homophobia, regardless of who espouses it, is an intolerable so cial bias, I must also implore Ms. Cronin in this case not to shoot the messenger. I am a reporter for The Bucknellian and, accord ingly, it is my intention and duty to report-- not editorialize. As a result of the reporter's unspoken pledge to abstain from inserting any type of bias into his or her work, I can no more show support for such instances of homophobic expression than de nounce it in my articles; such activ ity, as I am fully aware, is fodder for this paper's Opinions section only. I cannot be certain from Ms. Cronin's letter as to whether she had person ally viewed the documentary, and the specific scene to which her com plaint referred, but it seemed evident to me in watching the special that it was clearly the inmate's personal feeling that homosexuality in the prison presented a type of hardship for him, as it was alien to his own ways; as such, I reported on this fact in my review. If my wording seemed to sug gest an agreement with this individual's views, it was only be cause of unclear writing, and not the presence of my personal opinion. Ms. Cronin's letter also took issue with the fact that my article moved from the subject of homo sexuality directly to that of AIDS, thereby hinting at a direct linkage between the two subjects. To this, I say that I made this transition in the text because the documentary itself did. I chose this particular strategy because I wanted my article to fol low the chronological order of the special as closely as possible-- and a close study of both the article and documentary will show that I did so in all other sections of my report along with the paragraph on homo sexuality. Again, I feel that Ms. Cronin is unjustly assailing the ar ticle for merely following the tele vision special's accurate, if not so cially redeeming, portrayal of a prisoner's opinions. Furthermore, it must be made clear that my article suggested that homosexuality was a major cause of AIDS-related prisoner deaths in the penitentiary because it is the only type of sexual contact which occurs within its walls-- and so, in this spe cific instance (and not as in all cases in society), homosexuality was in deed a prime source of the AIDS fa talities in the penitentiary, and thus in essence ""an expected fact of life"" for these men, as I put it. I did not touch upon the pris oners' sharing of I.V. needles as be ing just as great a risk factor in the contraction of AIDS since, again, the documentary itself did not. To do so, as Ms. Cronin's letter suggested I should have, would have been to stray from the main directive which my editor gave me for the article-- namely, to accurately describe the content of the documentary, and not to champion a cause. Once more, that type of journalism is reserved for the Opinions section. I would like to impress upon Ms. Cronin that this response is merely being written to better clarify what my intentions were when I wrote the Lewisburg Penitentiary article, and not to have ""the last word."" I felt that a response had to be made since I strongly believe that her immediate assumption that my writing reflected innate homophobia is just as dangerous a phenomena as, per se, my assuming that a gay indi vidual is any less of a man, or a les bian individual any less of a woman. My point being, of course, that unfounded assumptions concerning another's character are just as im- proper if they are directed to ward the heterosexual commu nity as they are in being directed toward the homosexual commu nity. True, the article gave light to unconscious and unfair as sumptions which put down members of the homosexual population, but they were given solely by one of the inmates in the special; accordingly, I feel that Ms. Cronin's letter would have been better suited if it were directed to that man himself, or the producers of the documen- tary, and not to the conveyor of that man's opinion. If that does not seem to be a viable alternative to Ms. Cronin, then I would suggest that she could have called me per sonally in order to either verify or dispel her assumptions about my intentions in writing the dis puted section of my article. We must realize that what we read in the newspaper is not always going to be pleasing to our sensibilities. Anyone who has read media reports of the atrocities committed toward the people of Kuwait by occupying Iraqi soldiers during the Persian Gulf War, for example, knows that all too well. What is of utmost impor tance to keep in mind, though, is that the reporting of an unsettling issue does not automatically mean an acceptance or condon ing of it by the involved journal- See WRITER, page 9"

J,"An open letter to the campus com munity: I was quite disturbed after reading Janice Butler's and Amy Durgan's letters to the Editor which appeared in The Bucknellian on March 8.1 felt that they had misin terpreted Corey Zayatz's cartoon entitled ""How our school got its name."" As Butler noted, the cartoon displayed a man with -- ------ his pants"
d o w n,"handing a ""buck"" to a prostitute n a m e d "" N e l l . "" Butler dis missed the cartoon as sexist hu mor, but I -- ---- ---- -- believe that Butler is wrong to suggest that the artist was attempting to be hu morous. The graphic should be viewed as satire which does not condone prostitution nor the ""commoditization"" of women. I believe the artist has brought up an important point in this car toon--the prostituting of this Uni versity. For the right price, you can have your name emblazoned on one of the campus' buildings--perhaps even on the University itself. After all, that is why the University is re ferred to as ""Bucknell"" instead of The University at Lewisburg. Wil-"
I don't believe we,

Resource Center.,"liam Bucknell was very generous to the University during a period of fi nancial difficulty, and as a result, the University changed its name. The recent rededication ceremony at the ""Langone Center"" is one of many examples of institutional prostitu tion. I believe the cartoon's purpose was to look critically at just what this University will sell (or has sold) and at what price. It is analogous to pros titution, but -- ---- -- ---- the artist was c o n d o n i n g neither prac tice. In any case, art and opinion can often be inter preted differ ently. Being close-minded . ..... about what type of art or opinion is acceptable would stifle diversity of thought and jeopardize the foundation of a liberal arts edu cation. I, for one, was glad to see Zayatz's graphic in the paper, and I was equally glad to see the responses to it I don't believe we should suc cumb to close-minded thinking, even at the request of the Women's Resource Center.

Skena's,
Prescription,"By David Skena My last column addressed faculty/ student relations on an indi vidual level. The goal of this article is to address the issue more generally through the governance structures of those respective bodies. The actions of ""the Faculty"" and the efforts of the Bucknell Student Government must be called into question if we want to assess what changes would be help ful. The BSG has shown an inter est in opening ties with the faculty over the years but has met with only limited success. Programs that rec ognized outstanding faculty such as the ""Faculty Spotlight"" program de veloped by Grace Rhie under Sam Williams' administration have been tried. Informal receptions for faculty -- to talk with the student congress were tried during my administration. All of the programs that have been tried have helped communication be established for that day at whatever time but the two governance struc tures are very poorly linked. My recommendations for the BSG are to are to re-establish and fund pro grams that will allow congress and interested students to talk about campus issues with faculty. Even though such programs seem to be only modestly effective, some com munication is better than no com munication. Another goal would be to announce to the faculty the BSG's position concerning Pell Grants, ROTC or other student issues before any vote is taken. The main problem with the faculty is that some of their motions follow a pattern of disassociation rather than constructive engage ment. Motions that encourage the University to ""abolish"" or ""sever all ties"" with certain student organiza tions cause resentment among most students and seem unreasonable. When confronting a problem that concerns students, it would be help ful to consider reality along with idealism. Informing oneself of pre vailing student views on issues should be seen as a matter of re sponsible voting. The final motion passed by the faculty concerning ROTC is an excellent example of the way these kinds of issues should be handled. A very similar motion had been passed by the BSG a day ear lier. The other recommendation I have for the faculty is to send a rep resentative to every BSG meeting. As president of the BSG I attended the faculty meetings and informed Congress of what was going on. Ei ther David Ray or an appointee should make sure that they recipro cate and report back to the faculty. This small step would help inform the faculty of student perspectives and current concerns. Finally, I feel that David Ray and Alex Sherer should meet at least once a month to find and address areas of overlap and disagreement between the faculty and the students. These actions would have helped me had I thought to take them and I feel both the BSG and the faculty stand to benefit from increased communication."

Do you think that parking on campus is,
adequate?,"Paul Kahn '91 Political Science Pam Glass Admissions Receptionist Lynda Pope '92 Management Chandra Guinn '93 Sociology Chuck Gabler '92 Management Mark Bettner Professor of Accounting ""No, I think the university should conduct a study that looks to maximize the number of parking spaces available on campus."" ""I believe there is adequate parking but not convenient parking. Realis tically, there are enough spaces, but not within a short distance of where you want to be."" ""No. It doesn't make any sense to have more registered vehicles than parking spaces. People downhill should not be expected to park at the free spaces by the stadium if there are no spaces available near their building. Late at night, it is not safe."" ""No. I think the current system of allocating parking gives too much leeway to individuals who choose to not register their cars, thus limit ing the actual spaces for students who take the trouble of time and money to register their cars."""
S.T.O.P. addresses post-war issues,"To the Editor: In the midst of all the debate and political action concerning con cessions to military action and ev erything in between, one thing was agreed upon: that the mistakes of the United States government which contributed to Saddam Hussein's armed forces and subsequent inva sion of Kuwait should never be re peated. With this in mind, we ask the Bucknell community to consider recent events in the after-math of the armed conflict: the rebellious up risings on the part of Shiite Muslims and Palestinian factionalists, the violent response on the part of the Hussein government, the threat by the Hussein government of using chemical weapons on these rebel lious forces and the subsequent U.S. response to renew the military cam paign if Hussein follows through"
Reporter,"From page 8 ist. Despite the widespread loss of faith in the integrity of our present- day news media, I still do not believe that any person reserves the right to immediately suspect a slant in news coverage, or any other type of jour nalistic irresponsibility, on the part of the reporter until one first makes with these threats. The ""War"" may be over, but the fighting is not. Every war is sur rounded by significant events lead ing up to and away from the actual fighting. How many of us can forget how the seeds for World War II were planted in the aftermath of World War I? How many more potential ""Hussein's"" are we currently fund ing which could lead our children into war? For these, and many other important reasons, S.T.O.P. has continued it's pro-peace activities including the circulating of petition asking for financial support of Per sian Gulf veterans, a letter asking for financial and technical commitments to cleaning up one of the worst envi ronmental catastrophies since hu mans have lived on the planet, and the continuance of the weekly peace- vigils down by the Lewisburg Post Office asking people to remember the effort to speak to that individual personally in order to discern his or her intentions. As Ms. Cronin's let ter rightfully asked each of us to give the homosexual population a fair chance, so do I ask her to give jour nalists such as myself the benefit of the doubt. In closing, though, I would like to say that it is not my wish to peace and the women and men who oppose the military action on the part of the United States. Bucknellians, we ask you to remember that our troops are still over there and people are still dying. How many have died already? Most experts agree between 50,000 and 200,000 Iraqi's have died (many admit that the number could be as high as 500,000 dead) and that the environmental destruction and infrastructural failure could leave twice as many dead as the bombing did. Many of these men, women and children were Iraqi citizens with little or no control over Saddam Hussein or the Iraqi army. I am writing on behalf of S.T.O.P. to ask Bucknellians to remember the dead and mourn for the environment by wearing black during the week of March 18-22. By wearing black we hope people will remember the dead, lessen the impact of the main points of Ms. Cronin's letter, for they are good ones. If her response to my article makes only a handful of Bucknell students reconsider their possibly unconscious prejudice against ho mosexual individuals, then I will be more than happy to, for whatever reason, be made an example of. why they died, and what can be done to prevent people from dying in a war in the future. As a nation we have the responsibility to be in volved in the aftermath of a war we were involved with. As long as the oil-fires still bum and people still suffer as a result of the bombs we've dropped, we have the duty to work for the alleviation of their suffering and to build for a peaceful future. Please join us in this program. How many times has it been said ""the true test of a people is not how good they are at war but how good they are at peace."" What could be a better way to support peace than by mourning the loss of those who suf fer because peace does not exist. Stephen J. Leshlnski '91"
S.T.O.P.,"March 12,1991 I know that it made me think twice about such issues, and, in the final analysis, I'm happy to sec evi dence of at least one person who is willing to read the newspaper with a scrutinizing eye. Peter A. Lalos '93 March 11,1991 ""I'm really fed up with the park ing situation on campus. I live in Roberts and have a red sticker, but I usually end up having to park by Swartz or in open park ing."" ""Yes. I never have a problem parking; but, I drive old, beat- up cars, and no one ever wants to park near me. If anyone finds parking inadequate, they should look for my car. There's always a space near me."""

Tour guides put best foot forward,"By Sue Basalla Staff Writer Being a tour guide looks like a fun and relatively simple way to make some extra money, at least to the unsuspecting observer. To the initiated, however, it is a job requir ing preparation and effort, as pro spective guides participate in a day of training and receive a thick Tour answer that the prospective student is looking for. According to Colin Bridge- water '92, a recently retired tour guide, the question most frequently asked by parents is, ""Are drugs and alcohol a problem on campus?"" Students, on the other hand, want to know which residence halls are the best Slightly bizarre questions also when she opened it There was a guy getting dressed in the clothes that he had worn to formais the night be fore!"" Other stressful situations for tour guides include ones such as Jen Hunt '93 encountered last year. While she was leading a tour group out of Vedder Hall, someone hung a dummy in the window and screamed, ""Don't come here!"" Jen matters such as appearance and be havior. In the ""Do's and Don'ts of Touring,"" tour guids are reminded to arrive on time, dress neatly, and learn trivia about Bucknell. A guide should never wear a sweatshirt from another college, smoke, chew gum, or take any type of refreshment on the tour with him or her. The section titled ""Suggested Guide Manual to study. After talk ing with some tour guides and browsing through the manual, how ever, it seems that being a tour guide has many hidden perils. Tour guides have to be pre pared for strange questions and awkward situations. What does the quick-thinking tour guide say if the student asks, ""Is this a party school?"" while Mom asks, ""Do they serve al coholic beverages at those fraternity houses?"" These questions require extemporaneous thought and smooth talking. And usually the answer that the parent wants to hear is not the challenge the tour guide's compo sure. Paul Kahn '91 was once asked by an inquisitive father, while look ing at the observatory, if he had ever taken a date there with a bottle of champagne. Along with tricky questions come sticky situations. Christine Zapatoky '91, a veteran tour guide, described a recent tour disaster: ""It's really tough finding a freshman who's awake on Saturday morning at 11 a.m. to show a prospective stu dent what a dorm looks like,"" Chris tine explained. ""Once I knocked on a girl's door and she wasn't alone tried her best to ignore that loud ad vice and continue her tour. Pam Glass, admissions recep tionist, would agreee with Hunt's re action. ""We're not jokesters on the tours, but we try to keep it Iight,""she said. If something unexpected hap pens, she advises that tour guides should ""gauge the family's reaction"" and then offer a brief explanation such as, ""They're kids, that's col lege."" Unfortunately, the Tour Guide Manual provides no answers to these kinds of difficulties. Most of the manual is devoted to more practical Tour Routes"" lists all of Bucknell's attractions in outline form. Included are enough factual tidbits to satisfy even the most curious visiting par ents and students. Tour guides must be knowledgable about everything from the number of volumes in the library to the origin of the couches in the Weis Center (Pennsylvania House). It is impossible to prepare for some questions, however. Seeing the senior countdown clock in the Langone Center, a prospective stu dent once asked Bridgewater, ""Is that the temperature?"""
Entire universe contained within Davis Gym,
World Game illustrates international relations on a global scale,"By Sue Basalla Staff Writer ""The space shuttle would orbit as high as your ankle, ac cording to the scale of this map,"" explained Nancy Bell, co ordinator of the World Game Workshop. 'The moon would only be as high as the ceiling,"" she added, addressing the student standing at the center of the 70 x 30 foot ""largest and most accurate map of the world,"" spread out on the floor of the Davis Gym. This demonstration of the almost incomprehensible size of our planet started off the World Game sponsored by the Residen tial Colleges last Sunday in Davis Gym. The World Game allowed students and faculty to diagnose and develop solutions for the glo bal problems of malnutrition, so cial oppression, overpopulation, illiteracy, and pollution. Assigned to various nations in numbers corresponding with actual world population ratios, the players were provided with infor mation sheets about their nation's problems and available resources. Using balloons to represent military forces, plastic groceries for food, candles for energy, and other papers serving as money and technology, promoter of the World Game on campus, controlled all of North America during the game. Vincent and the representative of the Soviet Peter Ho / The Bucknellian Participants in Sunday's World Game search for their assigned coun tries on the""largest and most accurate map of the world."" the players negotiated trades with each other to improve their nation's situation. Beth Vincent '93, junior fel low of the International College and Union together disarmed a total of 3% of the world's military capabili ties, earning $ 1S million for each country. Deciding that curing illit eracy was a priority for North America, Vincent invested a third of the money in early education programs for disadvantaged chil dren. Other players were desig nated to act as various international organizations, such as the World Health Organization and the United Nations. For example, Japan, as represented by David Soil '93, found itself cited by the World Health Organization because of the high rate of suicide among Japanese professionals. Observing all of these activi ties and reporting on them at the end of each round was Kelly Ann Gosline '93 who served as the me dia for this microcosm. The atmosphere of the event was surprisingly apolitical; in the struggle to provide for the imagi nary population of their nations, players replaced political goals with humanitarian ones. As John Peeler, chairman and professor of political science and senior fellow of the International College, com mented: ""This game demonstrates that the long-term reality of re source allocation is more important than ideological differences."""

Dialectic Dining,"With Steve Hoerter and Liu Hsiang Yung Tin Restaurant Plaza IS Lewisburg Eat in or Take out 524-7582 Note: This week, noted pro vincial militarist and szechuan cuisine specialist Liu Hsiang joins regular columnist Steve Hoerter in evaluating an area Chinese res taurant. After my abrupt death in 19381 have had two spiritual occu pations. The first has been to read the Red Book and the Manifesto , in order to learn the best method by which to oppose the Koumintang and to recognize where I failed. The second has been to critique American presentations of my na tive szechuan cuisine. Let this visit to Yung Tin stand as a lesson in the dialectics of dining. That is to say, at the concrete and steel autoport on Route 15 the small has been in verted into the large. With perhaps fourteen tables, the family working in the kitchen and cheap prices, Yung Tin would appear to be small, or as you say, low-budget. Yet it is precisely this smallness that allows it to rise above, dialec tically, in an ascending spiral. Yung Tin is on the crest of the ris ing historical tide which has swept aside other institutions such as Pe king Gardens. Diners at the Yung Tin are greeted with a pot of hot tea and a dish of chow mein noodles. Steve, wishing to shatter the notion of the dialectic, by choosing three flavors instead of two, sampled the ""Three Flavors"" ($7.95)--a delicious combination of chicken, beef and shrimp with only the most crisp of vegetables. The 'Three Flavors"" is an example of the szechuan cuisine in which Yung Tin specializes. Yung Tin also serves Hunan and Cantonese cuisine. I, Liu Hsiang, found Yung Tin's cuisine in keeping with the dialectic. The szechuan Hot and Spiced Bean Curd ($5.75) was the higher product of the opposite ten dencies of hot spice and cool veg etables and bean curd (tofu). In this dish and the Hot and Sour Soup ($1.45) had beforehand, the heat of change, of social unrest, of histori cal progress was to be tasted. Yet this spicy, nutritious meal was not unmitigatedly hot, but tempered with the vegetative and organic. The meals, then, were truly a rep resentation of progress and the tri umph of the dialectic. Sadly, though, cuisine appears to be the one thread of szechuan culture that remains from that fine woven fab ric of history. I asked the young man who took our currency, knowingly, what Yung Tin meant. He said, ""Who knows?"" Ah, these children of the diaspora, routed by Chang Kia-shek. Yet, my comrade and I, rec ommend Yung Tin without reser vation. These fine meals are but singular representations of a greater goodness of cuisine that they can immediately call on to please their guests. We recommend the Sunday Buffet as well, though the multiplicity of dishes frustrates the dialectic of which I am so fond. Farewell, Liu Hsiang --""Do not mis take temptation for opportunity."" Steve Hoerter--""Heed he who walks with chicken on his shoulder."""

look ahead... A look back,"By Chris Drowne Staff Writer Despite the recent intrusion of inclement weather, the spring sports season is upon us. Here is a brief preview of each team: that should challenge Army for the inagural Patriot League softball title. Sharon Nichols '91, holder of seven Bucknell pitching records, will be asked to repeat her near per fect junior season. Following Nichols in the rotation will be Lisa Fink '93, and Michelle Kofron '93. ""Nichols is our stalwart, but the success of Fink's (who pitched only one game last sea son] pitching will be key"" said Franquet. Fink, who will also platoon at catcher and leftfield, set eight Bison records and was among the nation's leaders in stolen bases, home runs, and batting average. Another All-East Coast Confer ence First-Team selection, Jen Yuengling '93, will complete the platoon at both of those positions. The infield returns three starters from last spring's suc cessful squad. Second baseman Jennifer Kalochie '91 (.943 field ing average) will have to turn the pivot with a new shortstop this season while Carol Gesler '93 and Jill Szafranski '93 anchor the cor ner. Centerfielder Karen Smolskis '91 is a four-year veteren who will bat in the middle of a strong Bucknell line-up. MEN'S & WOMEN'S"
TRACK,"Bucknell's traditionally strong men's and women's track programs show no signs of drop ping off as they make the transi tion from the field house to Christy Mathewson Memorial Stadium. The men's team, which handily won the inaugural Patriot League indoor title, is led out doors by many of the same people who led them inside. Norbert Berenyi '91, Matt Deardorff '92, and Jeff Loomis '92, lead the dominant distance contingent. Jim Bock '92, Marc Lore '93, and Jean Simon '94 should pick-up points in the sprinting events. Hurdlers Mark Bardo '93 and Blaine Fawcett '93 are com ing off a successful indoor season as are throwers Paul Austin '91, Scott Croasdale '93, and Pete Gregory '93, and pole vaulter Jeff Schild '92. see SPRING, page 13 Bucknellian File Photo Sharon Nichols '91 overwhelmed opposing East Coast Conference batters last spring and should do the same to Patriot League batters this season"
BASEBALL,"The Bison have stampeded out of the gate to a 5-1 record, four of which have been come-from-behind victories. The offense, which is led by tri-captains Roger Ahrens '91, Mark Kennedy '92, and Ted Obligado '91. hasn't surprised any body with its .303 team batting aver age. The pitching, on the other hand, has surprised most people. In their last three games, Bison pitch ers have yielded only ten runs in cluding a shut-out. Kennedy, start ing his third consecutive season be hind the plate, will be in charge of handling the young pitching staff that includes only one senior. Bucknell's left side of the in field has changed from last spring. At shortstop, Bill Rinker '92 re places All-Everything Joe Markulike '90, and Larry Trout '93 takes over at third base. The right half of the infield returns intact with Obligado at first and Mike Kearns '93 and Dave Koemer '92 platoon- ing at second. Centerfielder Ahrens anchors an otherwise new outfield in which Steve Gyimesi '93, Matt Sniegocki '93, and Jim Zervanos '92 will share the two remaining positions. Fordham and Lafayette are the pre-season favorites in the Patriot League. However, if Head Coach Gene Depew, now Bucknell's all- time winningest coach, can continue to get quality performances from his pitchers, the Bison will pose a threat to the rest of the league including the above-mentioned two teams."
SOFTBALL,"Bucknellian File Photo First year Head Coach Dale Franquet inherits a talented squad Captain Mike Smigie '92 lines up a putt during practice last spring. Smigie is the ""veteran"" of Head Coach Tommy Thompson's ex tremely young golf team By Scott Brown StaffWriter Well the weather outside was frightful, but the sports were so de lightful. The winter slate of sports was full of the thrills of victory as well as the agonies of defeat. There were also a lot of crowning accom plishments for individuals as several Bison records were established. As it all now comes to a close, it is time to look back:"
MEN'S BASKETBALL,"The Breakin' Bison came into this season with doubts. They had to replace the leadership and scoring that was absent due to the loss of starters Greg Leggett and Mike Jo seph, who graduated last season. They also had to compete in a brand new conference against such formi dable opponents as Fordham and Holy Cross. They answered, though, in triumphant fashion right from the get-go. They began the season win ning seven of their first ten games, including victories over last year's NIT runner-up St. Louis and St. Francis (Pa.), who received an auto matic bid to the NCAA tournament this season. The men ran into trouble mid way through the season when they dropped seven of twelve, lowering their record to 12-10. Included in this stretch of games was a heart break loss at Towson St. by one point and two conference losses at home to both Holy Cross and Fordham, each by two points. But, sparked by a ten point win at Holy Cross the men were able to win six of their last nine before bowing out to Fordham in the second round of the Patriot League tourna ment with a final record of 18-13. Bucknell was led by co-cap tain Bill Courtney '91 who was se lected to the first team All-Patriot League. Courtney led the league in both scoring (20.3 ppg) and free throw shooting (.795) while estab lishing Bucknell records for most points and free throws made in a season. Aiding Courtney was Mike Bright '93 who set a Bucknell record in steals for a season with 65 and Pat King '92 who set a Bucknell record for FG percentage in a season by shooting .676. Both Bright and King were named to the Patriot League's second team. The future for the Breakin' Bison looks bright since four starters will return. The lone graduating starter is co-captain Keith Fenton '91. He will take with him the Bucknell record for most three-point shots attempted with 150."
WOMEN'S BASKETBALL,"The best thing the Lady Bison have to look forward to is a clean slate. The season was dismal pro ducing only two wins in 26 games. The season's highlight had to come when they upset Lafayette at home 61-60 to earn their first victory. Their second victory came in their next contest, an 82-71 victory over Howard. But, the Lady Bison dropped their last eight games in cluding a 28-point defeat to second- seeded Fordham in the opening round of the Patriot League tourna ment. The season marred some fine individual performances over the course of the season. Julie Bachman GR was named first team All-Patriot League for her efforts which in cluded 16.4 ppg as well as the best three-point shooting percentage in the conference (.448). Kelly Dee '94 proved to be a huge spark for Bucknell. Her 10.7 ppg and 40% three-point shooting got her the Patriot League's Rookie of the Year. Next year's team should im prove as they will gain another year of experience while only losing two players, Bachman and Caroline Shantz '91."
C.,Brldgewater/The Bucknellian Second-Team All-Patriot League selection Mike Bright '93 finished as the Breakin' Bison's second leading scorer
WRESTLING,"The Bison entered the season with great aspirations and a national ranking of 27. Their path was inter rupted by a set of losses in a west coast road trip against nationally ranked teams. In fact, five of the Bison's eight losses have come at the hands of nationally ranked teams. The Bison bounced back though from their trip to raise their record to 8-8 before grabbing third place in the East Coast Wrestling Association Championships. It was the grapplers' worst Finish in four years. Individually, the season pro vided many positives. Three wres tlers won their weight classes at the ECWA Championships and will get the opportunity to become All- Americans tomorrow at the Univer sity of Iowa. Mike Van Doren '92 won the 150 lbs. division, Tom Marchetti '91 was victorious at 167 lbs,, and Bryan Bums '91 won the 190 lb. division. Marchetti and Bums both emerged victorious for the third straight sea son. Marchetti will depart Bucknell as the most successful wrestler in its history."
MEN'S SWIMMING,
AND DIVING,"The men's regular season was very dismal until they began to come on as they won their second to last meet at St. John's before finishing 1- 10 in the regular season. The Bison finished third in the Patriot League Championships and were able to send four swimmers to the Eastern Regional Championships. At Easterns, the contingent of Jay Gross '93, Don Steenson '92, Chad Farrell '92, and Kevin Schroth '92 came in 23rd place. Leaving this season will be co captains Rick Hutchinson '91 and John Zeigler'91. Returning will be all the athletes who competed at Easterns including Gross, who was runner-up for outstanding swimmer at Patriots. Steenson set the Bucknell pool record in the 100-yard back- stroke."
WOMEN'S SWIMMING,
AND DIVING,"The women's team had a much better regular season winning six of ten regular season competi tions. They then went on to capture second place at the Patriot League Championships led by Margaret Grunow '93 who won both the 200- yard freestyle and the 100-yard freestyle. She was named runner-up for Outstanding Swimmer of the Championship. At Easterns, four women competed and placed 19th in a field of 34 teams. Three of the four women, Grunow, Kathleen Hartnett '94, and Andrea Falcione '92, will be returning to next year's team. Kelly Appier '91, who also com peted, will be one of the three senior tri-captains to be graduating. The other two are Carla Banashek '91, and Jodi Castallo '91."
INDOOR TRACK AND FIELD,"The indoor track season cul minated at the Patriot League Championships at Colgate Univer sity. The men finished first in the event for the tenth straight year and look very promising for the outdoor season. Paul Austin '91, Matt Deardorff '92, and Norbert Berenyi '91 were among several outstanding performers at Patriots. The women finished second, only 18 points behind Fordham. Seven Lady Bison, including Lynnette McBride '91 and Karen Shimomura '91, set new school records during the competition and those individuals should be in good shape when the season moves out side. Peter Ho/The Bucknellian Co-captain Caroline Shantz '91 finished her career fourth on Bucknell's all-time assist list. Shantz was also among the Patriot League's leaders in steals this past winter. i"

"Cold, Monmouth set back tennis","By Mike Markovich Despite sunny Lewisberg skies, the Bucknell men's tennis team opened its 1991 season last week with a 7-2 loss to Monmouth on Friday. Temperatures around 40 degrees prompted the teams to forego any third sets, opting instead to play seven-point tiebreakers if the first two sets were split. Four of the six singles matches were decided this way. The three doubles matches were played in the pro set format, with a single set to eight games deciding the victor. Jerome Charlier '92, playing at the number one singles spot for the first time in his career, fell to Monmouth's Jon Steffen in straight sets, 6-4,6-2. Charlier won the East Coast Conference Championship at the number two singles spot the past two years and moves to number one following the graduation of Ed Hess '90, his ex-number-one doubles partner. Hess was a three-time ECC champ at number one singles. Colin Bridgewater/The Bucknellian Bruno Barbera '94 serves into the ad court during last Friday's loss to Monmouth. Barbera dropped his match at the number three singles slot, 4-6,7-6 (7-4), 2-7. boasting a career 63-3 overall singles record and national ranking recognition last spring. The loss of Hess and number four singles player Dave O'Connor '90 would seem to bode negatively for the squad this year. But the ad ditions of Cris Sten.strOm '94 and Bruno Barbera '94 to the squad should help to fill the void. How ever, both lost their matches on Fri day, with StenstrOm playing number two and Barbera number three, playing in their first intercollegiate matches. StenstrOm jumped to a quick 6-0 Fust set victory, but dropped the second set 6-2 to set up one of the aforementioned tiebreakers in lieu of the third set. He fell 7-3 in the tiebreaker to drop the match. Barbera also fell in a third set tiebreaker 7-2 after splitting the fust two sets with his opponent. He went down in the first set, 6-4, before battling lack to capture the second set, 7-6 (7-4). In other singles action, An drew Cantor '92 picked up what would turn out to be Bucknell's only singles victory on the afternoon, at the number four spot. Cantor, the 1990 ECC champ at number six singles, rallied from a 7-6 (7-4) fust set loss to capture the second set 6-4. This forced the third set tiebreaker, which he won 7-4, claiming the match. Bucknell dropped the re maining two singles matches as Scott Bank '91, playing at number five, fell in a third set tiebreaker and Chris Rimpel '93 fell in straight sets at number six. Bank and Rimpel were the spoilers of a Monmouth doubles sweep, winning their pro set 8-0, at number three. Charlier and StenstrOm fell 8-4 at number one while the number two duo of Barbera and Cantor lost 8-3. The team's performance last week could be attributed to the fact that there was only one week's practice before the opener, the less- than-ideal tennis conditions, or sim ply the overall youth and inexperi ence of the team. Only three Bison players, Charlier, Cantor, and Bank, have had varsity tennis experience. Further help will be on hand, how ever, as Tim Aitken '94 and Greg Dowling '94 are expected to add depth at singles as well as additional doubles combinations. The squad travels to Florida over spring break, where it will play teams from Aurora University, Barry University, College of Boca Raton, Palm Beach Junior College, and Florida Atlantic. Head Coach Craig Reynolds is looking forward to the actual match experience and chances for the men to play outdoors in less hos tile weather. He also sees the trip as a chance to finalize the lineup, pointing out that it is ""wide open right now, but we'll be able to see where we stand when we return home."" The team is looking forward to a fruitful season and some fierce competition once the season really gets underway. Despite the loss of the graduates, Charlier is confident that the squad won't lose a step, saying, ""Having proven ourselves as a dominant force in the northeast in the past two years with consecutive ECC Championships, I believe that our competition might expect us to rest on our laurels. But closed eyes will be ripped open."""
One writer's NCAA Tourney picks,"By Kirk Peters Staff Writer Once again, it's time for the annual rite of Spring known as March Madness. Across America, soap opera addicts are being evicted from TV rooms by basketball junk ies and any person even remotely in terested in the NCAA tournament has coughed up hard-earned cash to prove their basketball insights in the office pools. Now that you've all heard Vitale, Valvano, Rafterry, and Packer express their insights and opinions on the subject, it's time you heard mine. Besides you should read something during halftime. First and foremost, there is ab solutely no truth to the rumor that"
Spring,"UNLV alumni were late in their payments to Nevada prison wardens for the use of several key players. Kidding aside, UNLV is a phenom enal team; however, they can be beaten. If Arizona can get a solid per formance out of the backcourt of Matt Muelbach and Matt Othick, they have a front line with four fu ture NBAers: Chris Mills, Ed Stokes, Sean Rooks, and Brian Wil liams. These two teams should meet in the West Regional final on March 23. It will be the best game of the tournament, and I like Arizona in an upset. The tournament's first few rounds will also provide many thrills. Some schools should venture into the previously unchartered ter- ritory of the Sweet Sixteen. Murray State scares all the big boys' coaches and they should make a run into the Sixteen before falling to Arkansas. Oklahoma State will also see the Sweet Sixteen behind superstar Barry Sanders. Sorry, I mean Byron Houston, the most un der-rated player in the country. I don't want all the traditional ists to worry; Indiana, North Caro lina Ohio State, Duke, and Arkansas will also join the upstarts in the Sweet Sixteen. I also have a pick for the truly staunch believers in basketball tra dition; UCLA will survive the east region and move on to the final four. They have some incredible offensive weapons, and being away from the California sunshine is just what they need to stay focused. Ohio State and Indiana will join UCLA and Arizona in the final four. Indiana and Arizona will meet in the finals on Monday, April 1 Once that young Indiana team gets to that point, Bobby Knight will give ""Midnight"" Lute Olsen a lesson in college basketball coaching. There will be hysteria in the Hoosier State when Calvert Chaney leads his team to another national championship, and for at least one day, Indiana's players will turn aside the wrath of Knight. Finally, I leave you with something to ponder during your 8- 12 hours of viewing this weekend. Where's Fordham? from page 11 Fordham, which finished sec ond to Bucknell for the men's indoor title by a mere 88 points, will most likely apply the same pressure this spring. The Lady Bison fell just 18 points shy of the Lady Rams from Fordham at the indoor champion ships. Karen Shimomuia '91 and Tricia Plasko '92 turned in outstand ing performances during the indoor season in the hurdles and sprints, respectfully. Kelly Marsh '91 leads a deep distance group. In the field events, the Lady Bison look strong. Lynnette McBride '91 dominated the long jump this winter. Lynda Rose '91, Jen James '93, and Jenny Thomas '94 are expected to contribute points in the jumping events as well. The one area that may prevent Bucknell's women from overtaking Fordham may be the throwing events. The current roster lists only one thrower for the entire team. Bucknell will host both the men's and women's track champi onships the weekend of May 3."
MEN'S LACROSSE,"Bucknell's men's lacrosse team has two major areas to replace from last year's team; putting the ball in the net, and keeping it out. Graduated are attackmen Jon Romm '90, and the Bison's other two top scorers, along with goalie Ken Mangano '90. ""We need to change our style since most of our fire power is gone"" said Head Coach Sid Jamieson. One position in which the Bi son are not inexperienced is midfield. Tri-captain Tom Daveris '91, Garrett Schwartz '91, and Greg Brown '92 must provide solid play while the defense and attack gain experience. Tri-captain Pat Sheridan '91 and Andy Linden '92, along with a host of recruits, will battle for defen sive spots while freshman Colin Barker will assume the starting goalie position. Offensively, tri-captain Matt Pearce '91 is one of the few experi enced players up front. A healthy Kevin Roth '92 will also be looked to for points."
WOMEN'S LACROSSE,"The Lady Bison will look to their mid-field for strength and lead ership. Tri-captain Julie Goeller'91, along with Julie McCausland '91 and Joann Talbot '91, should pro- vide just that for Head Coach Jen Averill. The defense features tri-cap tains Kristina Haas '91 and Lynn Santilli '91 who replace two gradu ated four-year starters. Kahra Foster '92 started every game in goal last season and should do so again this spring. Bucknell returns its three at tack players from last year's squad. Leslie Why '92, Hilary Thompson '91, and Dorie Ell wood '92 com bined for 28 goals, but, Averill points out they ""must create more scoring opportunities."""
GOLF,"Head Coach Tommy Thompson's team is one of the youngest in the recent history of Bucknell golf. His captain, Mike Smigie '92, isn't even a senior, yet he's the ""veteran"" of the team. Three freshman could very possibly fill out the rest of the top four slots. Don Hansen '94, the Bison's leading scorer in the fall, will be joined by Doug Dollenberg '94, and Bob McAleer '94 a transfer from teh University of Miami. Army and Colgate, perennial east coast powers, along with Lehigh, are predicted to battle for the Patriot League title. ""We might be a year away, but we'll compete,"" said Thompson. If the freshman can adjust to the rigors of college golf, the team could have a bright future."
TENNIS,"While most Bucknell Tennis fans are mourning the loss of #1 singles player Ed Hess '90 to gradu ation, few conference opponents ap peared at the wake. Hess' 63-3 record may take a team effort to make-up. Jerome Charlier '92, who won the East Coast Conference's number two singles title last spring, assumes the head singles position. He's fol lowed by a host of inexperienced youth. Only Charlier, Andrew Can tor '92, and captain Scott Bank '91 have seen varsity action. ""The lineup is wide open right now, but we'll be able to see where we stand when we return home [from a week in Florida],"" said Head Coach Craig Reynolds. The Patriot League title is also wide open, but Army and Colgate are the favorites entering the season."
Athlete of the Week,"MARK KENNEDY '92 Baseball player Mark Kennedy '92 is selected Athlete of the Week for his performances in Bucknell's three victories this past week. The catcher from Franklin, PA went four for ten with four runs batted in, including a game winning triple with two outs in the bottom of the seventh inning against Franklin & Marshall. Kennedy, starting his third saeson as the Bison's number one back stop, has also done a tremendous job running a young and improved pitching staff."

Bucknell nine surge to 5-1 record,
"""The Cardiac Kids"" follow-up come-from-behind sweep of F&M with shutout against Gettysburg","By Jon Terry Staff Writer Break up the Bison! The Bucknell baseball team made it a perfect week with a thrilling doublehcader sweep of Franklin & Marshall on Saturday and a signifi cant win over Gettysburg on Tues day. The 3-0 win over Gettysburg was particularly important because for the first time this year the Bison combined the three most important aspects of baseball--pitching, de fense, and hitting--in one game. Let's start with the pitching. As reported previously in this col umn, unless the pitching shapes up, it could be a so-so year. However, on Tuesday, the men on the hill sent Gettysburg back to the battlefield twisted in knots. Starter Mike Rizzi '91 pitched seven outstanding innings, giving up only two singles, while walking four. He struck out three, all in key situations with runners on base. Rizzi attributed much of his success to the fact that he started his season early. Throwing seriously off of a real mound during the month of January now has him ahead of the opposing hitters, most of whom picked up bats for the first time all winter just a few weeks ago. Part of the blame for the four walks may go to the cold, blustery weather associated with early season baseball (I wonder how a dome would look behind the Mods - nah, George Jenks would never approve). Let's not forget to mention Denis Maguire '93, who pitched two outstanding innings, giving up only one hit (he later picked the man off first), in picking up his first save. Another factor in Bucknell's first nine-inning shutout since 1985 was the solid defense. According to Rizzi, his glovemen did a solid job behind him, helping him out of some early inning jams. In particular, third baseman Larry Trout '93 really flashed some leather, handling seven chances flawlessly. In addition, first baseman Ted Obligado '91 tied a school record by recording 18 putouts, evi dence of the Bison hurlers effec tively keeping the ball on the ground. Two of Bucknell's three runs on Tuesday were thanks to a critical three base error by Gettysburg centerfielder Tim Tolve, but the Bi son still managed nine hits in the cold weather. Obligado showed signs of ending his slump by col lecting two hits, as did Mike Kearns '93 and Matt Sniegocki '93. Among the regulars at this point, Trout leads the team with a .435 batting average, while Kearns (.389), Dave Koemer '92 (.385), and Sniegocki (.308) are all off to good starts. Add to that the power of Mark Kennedy '92, Roger Ahrens '91, and Obligado, and the offense still looks potent. Looking back on what may have triggered Bucknell's perfor mance on Tuesday, let's go back to Saturday. In the first game of the doubleheader with F&M, the Bison faithful witnessed another come- from-behind victory, although this one was by far the most dramatic. The Diplomats had built a 6-3 lead off of pitchers Dan Krewson '92 and Jack Kazanjian '93 when they turned to reliever Thad Kreshko to slam the door. As it turned out he slammed it on his own foot. Mark Kennedy belted a two-out bases- loaded triple to cap a four-run rally in the bottom of the seventh (they only play seven in doubleheader games) to give the Bison a 7-6 win. Roger Ahrens was the star of the second game, but from an unfa miliar vantage point While Roger has won many games in the past with his bat, this time he did it from the pitcher's mound. An outfielder his whole career, Ahrens will be looking at some time on the hill this year. On Saturday he notched his first collegiate win, a complete game seven-hitter, allowing only two earned runs. As Paul Schaeffer would say, Bucknell pulled that nutty comeback thing once again, putting up a six-spot in the fifth in ning to turn a 4-3 deficit into a 9-4 win. Jim Zervanos '92 had a two- run single in the inning, and, thanks to Franklin & Marshall's three errors in the inning, the Diplomats may as well have loaded up the buggies and headed back to Lancaster early. In all, seven different Bison drove in runs, with Trout collecting two hits. Thirteen of their next fifteen games are at home. So if you're one of those people who has thought about going to a game but never has, here are a few things to think about: -it's a chance to find out which Bison slugger hit your Mod -the little orange programs - great literature! -an opportunity to needle the opposition (case in point, the left Colin Bridgewater/The Bucknellian Tri-captain Ted Obligado '91 fields the throw from fellow tri-captain Mark Kennedy '92 during the Bison's doubleheader sweep of Franklin & Marshall. Obligado tied a Bucknell single-game record for put-outs in a nine-inning game with 18 against Gettysburg this past Tuesday."
Lax falls to highly-ranked Tigers,"By Scott Brown Staff Writer With last year's top three scorers and four-year staring goalie graduating, the men's lacrosse squad was pretty inexperienced en tering their first match against Princeton last Saturday. In fact, the team features just five seniors. Laden with freshman, the Bison only have fifteen total players with colle giate experience. Coach Sid Jamieson realizes the team is young and hopes to make up for it with a rotating system of seven attackmen. ""This is a more team-oriented concept rather than individual talent. They are very to gether as a group as far as position is concerned, and that's a real plus,"" he noted. In addition, Jamieson hopes to make up for inexperience with good speed and plenty of depth. The key to the attack will fall on the shoulders of tri-captain Matt Pearce '91, a three-year letterman who registered eight goals and three assists last season. In the midfield, tri-captain Tom Davis '91, another three-year letterman tallied nine goals and six assists last season. Garrett Schwartz '91 will also be a force as he scored ten times last season. The most important factor is not the play of the attackmen. ""The key to this season is how well we play in the midfield. It's a question of how much we produce offen sively, and how well we come back and play defensively,"" commented Jamieson. The defense, though, is the biggest question mark. The defen sive unit will have to replace two starters in addition to Ken Mangano '90, a four-year starting goalie who graduated as the Bucknell all-time save leader with 762. This task will fall on the big shoulders of Andy Linden '92, who at 6-4 and 230 pounds has the physical attributes to compete with anyone in the Patriot League. The defense will also feature tri-captain Pat Sheridan '91 and a freshman goalkeeper, either Colin Barker '94 or Matt Wojnovich '94. Barker got the call as the Bi son entered its first game of the sea son against a Princeton team that was ranked fifth in the nation in the pre-season USILA poll. This will be the two team's fifth match-up, with Bucknell's sole win coming in 1986. The Tigers won last year's match-up 13-9 and were coming off an im pressive 15-10 victory over a strong Johns Hopkins team. They were also coming off their most victorious season in their school's history (11- 5) and their first NCAA tournament appearance. All their experience showed as the Tigers thoroughly dominated the contest from start to finish. They built up a 9-0 halftime lead en route toa 17-1 rout. Bucknell's lone score came from midfielder Michael Conway '92 in the third quarter. Twelve different Tigers scored. The Tigers outshot the Bi son 44-5. Barker had 24 saves in the loss. The one goal ties the Bucknell record for the fewest goals scored in a game. The last time the Bison only scored one time was April 13,1974 in a 10-1 loss to Rutgers. The Bison will hope to bounce back in its next match, Wednesday against Georgetown, at home. Bison attackman Todd Streelman '93 converges on a loose ball while two Princeton defensemen attempt to hold him ofT during last Saturday's 17-1 loss. Princeton, coming off a 15-10 victory over Peter Ho/The Bucknellian Johns Hopkins, entered the game ranked in the top ten in the nation. Bucknell's next home game is Wednesday, March 20, against Georgetown. side of F&M's infield made four er rors in two innings) -a chance to use the new six- trillion dollar Route 15 underpass -the air seems so much fresher out there (it must be because you're so far away from the Caf) Keep in mind that they are normally fast finishers and slow starters. That fact, coupled with the impressive showing thus far, should provide optimistic thoughts about the 1991 season. The Bison travel toVillanova tomorrow for a double header against a very powerful Wildcat ball club. Then, they return home for eleven games in 16 days, which will be highlighted by a doubleheader against Tom Browning's alma mat ter Lemoyne."

All-Blacks,
Dickinson,"By Mark Spira and Mitch Benton StaffWriters Bucknell's Men's Rugby Team entered the 1990-91 spring season looking to improve upon their mediocre fall performance. Over that season, the squad managed only two wins and a tie in their six matches. To right their ways, the All- Blacks travelled to Carlisle, Pa., to challenge the Dickinson College Red Devils. Bucknell's chances were greatly bolstered by the return of two outstanding veterans, wing Steve Casey '91, playing in his first game since suffering an ankle injury in last season's first match, and out side center Andy Meiers '91, re turning from a semester abroad. The reuniting of the All- Blacks backfield proved to be too much for the overmatched Dickinson squad, as these two se niors each scored twice in leading Bucknell to a 50-0 romp. Mark Spina '92 led the scoring, tallying twelve points on the afternoon, two try's as well as two successful conversions of jxjint after attempts (in rugby, try's are worth four while P.A.T.'s count for two). While the All-Blacks domi nated the match in all aspects, they also had to endure a rash of injuries, including two to Mike Biglow '91 and Greg Dorr '93, which forced the starters to leave the match. Fortu nately for the squad and these play ers, none of the injuries proved very serious and they were able to re-en ter the match. The scoring was opened by Casey during the first five minutes of the 40 minute first half, and the All-Blacks were never really threat-"

While the team has a his tory of letting up in the second half of matches, this was not the case against Dickinson. Spina scored twice in the half, while Casey and Meiers scored their second each. Also tallying were co-captain Chip Bousom '91 and Howie Fetzer '93. The final try was entered by Tom O 'Brien '93 and Mitch Benton's '93 P.A.T. conversion rounded the final score to 50-0. Team co-captain and club president Dave Keim '91 was very happy with the results of the after noon. ""1 thought that everyone played exceptionally well today. The pack [forwards] played an out standing game, winning the ball from Dickinson and getting it out to the backs. The backs played great as well, especially the guys who scored twice and O'Brien with his running the ball and tackling."" When asked to explain the lopsided score, Keim cited Bucknell's edge in both size and experience. The All-Blacks will play at Lafayette on Saturday, March 16, and will return to play home matches after Spring Break. ^ Men's Rugby Statistics ^"

"Sojka, trustees respond",
to sophomore rush issue,
Complaints compel Sojka to meet with nat'l Greek representatives,"By Travis Elliott Staff Writer An angry President Sojka, along with members of the board of trustees and administration, met with disgruntled Greek national repre sentatives on March 19 in Hunt For mal to discuss sophomore rush. The meeting was in response to a letter writing campaign recently spon sored by fraternity and sorority na tionals opposed to the sophomore rush program, scheduled to begin next fall. Lee Idleman, chairman of the board of trustees, said the letter writ ing campaign initiated by the na tionals was creating animosity based on misinformation. He said the let ters had ""started up debate after it was beginning to settle down."" Idleman explained that the de cision to switch to sophomore rush had been made last May, and the campaign against sophomore rush was coming in ""the eleventh hour,"" just as the program is about to be implemented. Noting that many Greek alumni were threatening to discon tinue donating to the University on the advice of the nationals, Sojka warned, ""You can really hurt a university's pocketbook by getting these letter-writing campaigns go ing-"" Sojka explained that he felt personally attacked by many of the letters which claimed he had been two-faced toward the Greek system. He said, ""I think the Greek stance I've taken deserves more respect than I have received."" Sojka went we have made our decision, and now we are hopeful that we can get to gether to make the best of the new system."" The national representative of Delta Gamma said, ""We came today"
"""As far as the trustees are concerned, we",
"have made our decision, and now we are",
hopeful that we can get together to make,
"the best of the new system.""",
"--Jim Nevels, Board of Trustees","on to say that he had no hidden agenda to get rid of the Greek sys tem, but he sternly reminded na tional representatives that Greek or ganizations are guests at Bucknell. Idleman reminded the national representatives that the trustees had overwhelmingly endorsed sopho more rush in a 37 to one vote. Sojka boiled the controversy down to the question of ""who runs this University."" 'The Board of Trustees decide what we shall do,"" said Sojka, ""and as we speak, Bucknell is in the middle of a long-range planning project which will make Bucknell unique among institutions."" Trustee Jim Nevels explained, ""As far as the trustees are concerned, and the first thing we heard was a reprimand--we did not come here to be scolded."" She explained that the representatives were attempting to fight a national erosion of the Greek system. She warned that what Bucknell does will probably also be implemented by other universities, noting that ""the Bucknell plan"" is now being considered by Bloomsburg, Colgate, and Glassboro. The largely silenced group of nine Greek lobbyists included repre sentatives from Alpha Chi Omega, Kappa Alpha Theta, Kappa Kappa Gamma, Pi Beta Phi, Delta Upsilon, Kappa Delta Rho, Sigma Alpha Mu, and Sigma Chi. In regards to the merits of sophomore rush, Sojka urged the representatives to consider ""the broader issue of trying to evolve a social/residential life at Bucknell that will serve the institution well."" He said that sophomore rush would give freshmen a longer period in which to become acquainted with the institution and the various chap ters, while hopefully getting seniors to live in the houses and to take on leadership roles that would promote responsibility. Delta Gamma's national rep resentative expressed concern that sophomore rush would deny fresh men a valuable leadership experi ence, and she suggested that fresh men would adjust faster and become better acquainted to Bucknell as a member of Delta Gamma. The fresh man leadership con cern was echoed by Kristine Elliott '92, president of the Panhellenic Council. ""I think we at least have to give sophomore rush a try,"" said Nevels, ""I'm disturbed at the sug gestion that we should reconsider our decision at the eleventh hour.""

Federal court strikes down,
privacy of security records,
Condoms reappear on Bison,
convenience store shelves,"By Tara Gilligan Staff Writer The Bison convenience store is again selling condoms after tem porarily removing them from its shelves. Condoms reappeared on the shelves following the presentation of a new policy by the Campus Advi sory Committee on AIDS and ap proval by President Sojka. The policy, an extension of the policy passed in 1987, is a response to in creased concerns over the availabil ity of condoms on campus. ""We had some students who asked us to put them in the store when it opened, so we did that origi nally, and then we were asked not to do it because they had not really de cided where they should be on cam pus,"" said Hank Ross, director of dining services. Ross said that Preston Hoyle, director of the Stu dent Medical Center, requested that Ross remove the condoms from the convenience store until the advisory committee completed its review of the condom policy. The increased pressure to make condoms available is, in part, linked with a heightened concern over the spread of sexually trans mitted diseases and AIDS. A recent BSG motion, which urges not only the sale of condoms in the conve nience store but also pushes for the installation of additional condom vending machines across campus, reflects this concern over the spread of disease. Selling condoms in the con venience store ""is an extension of the old policy,"" according to Hoyle. As part of the initial policy, five condom vending machines were placed in residence halls, and the medical center began selling ""safe sex kits,"" which include twelve condoms and foam. The change in policy followed ""strong recommendations from people on the AIDS task force that condoms be sold in the convenience store,"" said Hoyle. Hoyle also met with a representative from the com pany which supplies the five condom vending machines to dis cuss the possibility of installing more machines on campus. But the"

Analysis,"Ashley Cherlkof/The Bucknellian Students now once again have the opportunity to purchase condoms in the Bison convenience store as well as the several vending machines located around campus. supplier, who provides the dispens ers free of charge, was hesitant to install additional machines. ""The machines were not used as much as they had anticipated; they were not cost-efficient. [The suppli ers] were reluctant, themselves, to put more machines in,"" he said. University subsidization is not an immediate alternative, according to Hoyle. ""Before we [go] to the expense of putting extra machines around, we ought to expand selling them in the convenience store,"" he said. The cost of installing and maintaining each machine would total $200. Currently, vending machines are located in five residence areas: Vedder, Roberts, Swartz, Bucknell West, and the Gateways. The possibility of providing additional condom vending ma chines has not been entirely ruled out. But the committee will wait until about November to re-evaluate the current policy. Hoyle recom mends that the AIDS task force conduct an extensive survey to de termine what policy changes stu dents still feel are necessary. Some students have already proposed changes. BSG passed a six-part motion, introduced by Brian Selmeski '92, to provide more condoms as a way of preventing sexually transmitted diseases. But according to Hoyle, who addressed BSG at its March 20 meeting, ""If you look at their resolution you can see that some of their things were al ready in place."" See CONDOMS, page 2 By Bob Ritter Staff Writer The debate over the release of information on campus crime, long a smoldering issue of contention be tween college administrators and student journalists, has recently been brought into sharp focus by a recent court case, an edict from the federal Depart ment of Educa tion, and some frustrated stu dents who took matters into their own hands. At issue is which of two important principles--a student's right to privacy and the safety of the community--should take prece dence. The 1974 Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, better known as the Buckley Amendment, prohibits federal funding to any edu cational institution ""which has a policy or practice of releasing, in any form, any personally identifiable in formation contained in personal school records"" without the permis sion of the student, while guarantee ing students access to examine their files. The original intent to the law was to prevent the release of inaccu rate information in records, but many university officials claim that the law applies to the release of names in campus police and security records, and the U.S. Department of Education has recently jumped into the fray on their side. Traci Bauer, editor of the Southwest Missouri State Southwest Standard , has brought the issue to the federal courts in what is expected to be a test case for this application of the Buckley Amendment. After Bauer was denied access to the files concerning an alleged campus rape, she sued the University, claiming that the Buckley Amendment should not apply to such records. The University had also broken with its own practice, in which it had released crime information to the Standard in the past. In a separate action, the Uni versity sought a gag order to prevent Bauer from publishing the inform mation after she received it from unofficial sources. University at torney John Black claimed that the release of the names of witnesses and victims, also contained in the crime reports, would have a ""chill ing effect"" on the reporting of crimes to authorities. This concern was also echoed by Vince DeCerchio, Bucknell di rector of security and safety. Com menting on the Bauer decision, he said, 'The requirements of public safety should not extend to the dis closure of the names of victims or witnesses, but only to the details of the criminal incidents and the names of criminal perpetrators. The public safety need is fully satisfied by disclosing the details of a crime or unsafe condition without endan gering innocent participants."" Restrictions tighten Ironically, the Bauer case has thus far led to further restrictions on the release of information. The Student Press Law Center, a Wash ington-based advocacy group as sisting Bauer's case, placed into evidence a survey showing that fif teen universities release such secu rity information, indicating that the schools ascribe to Bauer's interpre tation of the law. Following the re lease of the survey, the fifteen insti tutions received letters from the Education Department informing them that they were in violation of the Buckley Amendment, and warning them to stop releasing stu dent names. Six institutions heeded the letter and stopped the practice; at least four more continue to release the crime information while they review the law. Etta Fielek, an Education De partment spokesperson, said of the crackdown, ""There is no new policy. This is just a restatement of the regulations."" The Press Center claims to have located nine other institutions that release the crime information, but they are refusing to make these findings public, for fear of similar Education Department retribution. The Education Department's interpretation of the Amendment was dealt a severe blow on March 14 when U.S. District Judge Russell G. Clark ruled in favor of Bauer, claiming that the security records were not protected under the Buckley Amendment, and that withholding the information violated both the first amendment and the fifth amendment's due process clause. In his decision Clark ruled that the regulations violate the spirit of the Buckley Amendment, and that lawmakers had never intended the provision to cover campus crime. See RULING, page 2"

Ruling--,"From page 1 Clark, however, stopped short of awarding Bauer monetary dam ages, awarding the minimum one dollar rather that the $5,000 she was seeking Southwest Missouri State has decided not to appeal the ruling, but it is a good bet that a similar case will probably make its way to the Supreme Court in the near future. The Department, however, has not surrendered its fight. Last week lawyers for the Department filed motions with the court allowing it to intervene and block the ruling, claiming that Clark exceeded his ju risdiction by ruling on Education Department regulations, when the case should have only evaluated Missouri state law. Bauer's attor neys plan to fight this new motion. Mark Goodman, executive di rector of the Student Press Law Center, was quoted in the April 3 issue of The Chronicle of Higher Education as saying, ""The Educa tion Department is now a co-con spirator in the effort to cover up campus crime. We've got an ad ministration that claims to be pro education and anti-crime. To take a step like this shows how hollow their support for both of these issues is."" Currently, Buckncll does not release the names of any students cited for violations by the Office of Security or Safety or the Office of Residential Life. Since the arrival of DeCerchio last October the Office of Security and Safety frequently re leases copies of initial crime reports to The Bucknellian, but with all per sonal student information blacked out. John Dunlop, dean of students, explained the Bucknell policy: ""We will answer questions about inci dents, but we don't want to divulge information on names... We can confirm information, short of who it is."" DeCerchio echoed this policy, explaining, ""We don't give informa tion on a student unless it arises from another source [such as police records]. We don't give out [stu dents'] names without [their] per mission."" Brown adds new wrinkle At Brown University, female students faced a situation even more difficult than the Bauer case--cam pus administrators refused to lake any action on rape accusations, choosing instead to shield those stu- dents even from investigation. A group of female students decided to seek their own justice, writing the names of the alleged rapists on bathroom walls on campus. Instead of being protected, at least one male student identified felt compelled to speak out publicly, explaining that he had been wrongly accused by the women. The action touched off heated campus debate, and is caus ing Brown to reexamine its sexual misconduct code. More than the Southwest Missouri case, the Brown incident touches on the heart of the debate, and the concern of many college administrators: what special rights do students deserve in a learning environment which, in most other areas, allows students to make mis takes and learn from them, and what is the best way to protect the rights of all students involved. Dunlop feels that the Univer sity can protect campus safety with out releasing student offenders' names. ""If a student is a threat, you deal with them,"" he said. ""Identify ing them by name campus-wide is a mistake. Its unintended purpose is you strip that person of their pri vacy."" Dunlop believes such public attention ""seems to be a contradic tion with the punishment"" Dunlop believes that, by publicly exposing a student as a threat, the University is showing ""we don't trust him not to make that mistake again... If you have a student you believe is a risk, you get rid of him."" He questioned ""what additional purpose is served"" by attaching a student's name to a published crime report Dunlop believes there are ""quite a few issues involved"" in the recent debate, but that the largest problem is that ""you're probably setting that person up for more pub lic awareness in a tiny community"" like Bucknell. ""It's very anonymous in the real world, but in a small community of 3,000 students they are more susceptible to community and public awareness."" Dunlop feels this concern is greatest with small offenses, since ""not all sins are equal sins"" and small transgressions may receive more attention that they de serve. DeCerchio, however, admit ted that ""I differ with his [Dunlop's] approach on this particular issue."" While explaining that ""I have never released students' names in the past...to protect the student on campus until they've been through the judicial system,"" DeCerchio said, ""I think they should be pub lished [after a student is found guilty]. If it was legally permissible, I would say publish the results of judicial hearings."" DeCerchio noted several positive benefits of making the names and outcomes public, such as deterring the person from commit ting the same crime again, deterring others by ""letting the public know people are getting caught...letting people know things are getting done"" (He used DU1 convictions as an example), ""alerting people to a problem that exists,"" and ""bringing a problem out in the open, encour aging people to report their crimes."" Of the deterrent argument, Dunlop said, ""That's the one thing that might be semi-valid. The only incentive I can see is an incentive not to get into trouble again"" and to dis suade others from similar acts. However, instead of alarming the campus and violating the accused's right to privacy, Dunlop believes ""we should [get] rid of the student if its a problem."" He believes the Uni versity can handle its internal safety concerns without the necessity of publicly exposing the students. Journalists defend ruling Frank Gibson, president of the Society of Professional Journalists, rejects this privacy argument. Speaking on the Bauer case, he said, ""This is an important decision and makes a strong statement that stu dents have the same right to know what is happening in their commu nities as other Americans....We hope it sends a clear signal to col lege administrators that the Buckley Amendment was never intended to block the flow of information vital to public safety."" This assessment was shared by Travis Elliott '92, editor of The Bucknellian, who called it ""an ex cellent idea that the University re lease names."" Elliott also went fur ther than either Dunlop or DeCerchio, calling for the names of students to be published immedi ately after they are charged. He explained that ""the press should be very careful in how it re ports criminal charges before [the students] have been found guilty."" DeCerchio admitted, ""I don't know if I can agree with issuing the names of arrested students,"" due to the stigma which could be falsely at tached if the student is later cleared. Elliott believes the key ""is how the press handles it. The press has a duty to follow up, especially if the person is cleared,"" and the two ""stories should should receive somewhat equal prominence"" in the newspa per. Elliott admits that there is ""definitely a risk"" in printing such material incorrectly, both to the ac cused student's reputation and in the danger of a defamation suit against the newspaper. He believes, how ever, that ""most student presses will be responsible...That's the whole point of the press--sticking to the facts and being responsible in what they report."" Other schools change policy In the wake of the Bauer case and other challenges by the media, some universities are moving to re classify security information so that it clearly does not fall under the Buckley Amendment. In July a similar lawsuit filed by the Oakland Post at Oakland University in Michigan was settled out of court. As part of the agreement, University officials agreed to reclassify their campus security reports as police records, removing them from Amendment protection. Michigan has also passed a law which grants all campus security forces powers equal to municipal police forces in the state. This measure will make it harder for schools to prevent the re lease of crime information, since the security department would be more noticeably separated from the school's academic mission. Such a solution, however, would not work at Bucknell, since the University clearly has neither the need nor want of a full-scale campus police force. Legislation, however, may be on the way, since there is talk among some members of Congress about clearly defining the Buckley Amendment so that it does not cover campus crime. A substantial lobby exists in Washington which would push for the passage of such a bill. The same groups were recently suc cessful in gaining passage of a fed eral law which requires institutions to publish yearly statistics on cam pus crime. Hopefully for the student press the pressure of such groups, com bined with recent media attention on the issue, will secure passage of a revision of the Buckley Amendment, since it is impossible to know con clusively how the new, more con servative court will rule on the issue, with the significant absence of Jus tice William Brennan, the staunch est advocate of First Amendment rights on the court."

The poll indi cated where students thought condoms ought to be sold. ""My per sonal feeling is that they should be available in the bathrooms,"" she said, admitting Financial and politi cal problems with her suggestion. Woods's survey results showed that 51% of the 591 respondents also would like to see condom machines in the bathrooms. ""I really think that's the best way to do it because on other campuses that's how I've seen it done,"" she said. Woods also agreed that candy machines could be used to sell condoms. ""Take out the Three Musketeers; put in the condoms. That seems really practical but then you run into the problem that people don't want to see them,"" she said. Woods is a new member of the AIDS task force, but unlike others on the committee, her motives for increasing the availability of condoms is not simply prevention of diseases. ""I would rather leave it up to the health center and the moralists to figure out why [condoms] should be there. It's probably not the most politically correct attitude as far as condoms go. On principle of the matter, I just think that they should be available to whomever wants them,"" Woods said. The decision to make condoms available will not neces sarily solve the difficulties pointed out by proponents of the new policy. ""I'm not sure that having condoms in every room in every residence hall is going to solve the problem,"" said Hoyle. ""The problem is basically one of attitudes that you're trying to modify,"" he said. Unless students decide to use condoms, he said, in creased availability will be of no consequence."

Coach Howard resigns prior,
to investigation of program,"Bucknellian File Photo -Former Women's Head Basket ball Coach Lori Howard, re signed from her post on March 18. By Jamie Diaferia andDavid Murray Staff Writers Head women's basketball coach Lori Howard resigned from her position Monday, March 18 more than two weeks after she re fused to allow four of her players to return to Lewisburg from Worces ter, Massachusetts on the team bus. Athletic Director Rick Hartzell has formed a committee to find a re placement for Howard. The controversy began on March 2 when Assistant Coach Terri Grieb discovered four players with alcoholic beverages in a hotel room. After Howard informed the players that they would not be al lowed to ride the team bus, they were forced to contact the parents of team member Kristi Dunleavy '91, who were vacationing nearby. Dunleavy's parents transported the players back to Bucknell. Howard's decision, made ""in poor judgment"" according to Hartzell, placed her at the center of considerable controversy. In addi tion to creating a dangerous liability situation, the incident raised a series of questions regarding the school's written rules and policies about team infractions. Several coaches ac knowledged the fact that the rules were not as clear as they could be. This, they said, was a result of their not being written out, but rather based entirely on a verbal policy. Howard's resignation fol lowed a meeting between her and Hartzell on Monday, March 18. Sources tell The Bucknellian that at this meeting Hartzell either issued Howard a list of her options, or de livered an ultimatum to quit or be fired. Hartzell would not comment on the resignation. Asked if Grieb would remain as Assistant Coach, Hartzell said, ""She has a contract and we will honor that"" Immediately following Howard's decision, Hartzell formed a committee to find a suitable re placement. ""We are starting the search for a replacement,"" he said. ""A committee has been appointed. We've had twenty applications and there are an additional fifteen indi viduals that I would like to talk to."" When asked where the applicants would be sought, he replied, ""Any where in the country."" Additionally, Hartzell had said previously that an in-depth investi gation would be undertaken to assess die state of the women's basketball program. Asked if such an investi gation would now be necessary, Hartzell replied that it would not. Howard's resignation erased the need for such a probe, he said."
Philip Roth delivers reading,
"from latest work,",
Patrimony,"By Marc Haimes Staff Writer Author and alumnus Philip Roth '58 read last Monday from his new novel Patrimony: A True Story to an audience which overflowed the pews of Bucknell Hall and included local television crews, as well as a mixture of students, townspeople, staff and faculty. Roth first ad dressed the audience directly, de scribing his years at Buckncll, and then presented a chapter from his novel, in tribute to his former teacher Mildred Martin, emerita professor of English. Following the dramatic pre sentation, Roth brought both Profes sor Martin and Professor of English Jack Whcatcroft onto the stage with him. Amidst loud applause, Martin expressed her pride for two of her former students. Patrimony traces the relation ship between 57-year-old Roth and his 86-year-old dying father during their last years together. Through out his presentation, Roth used facial expressions, gestures, and a variety of voices to help convey the simple and emotional tone of the story. ""What the hell do I need 'em for?"" Roth bellowed using his strong- willed father's Yiddish inflection, as he described the old man's stubborn desire to give back all of his son's gifts before his death. ""Do as I say,"" Roth asserted in his own voice to the old man, sounding stem, yet slightly surprised at his own words. In addition to his reading, Roth also visited Professor Harriet Pollack's 20th Century American literature class. Roth had sent ap proximately 30 free hardback cop ies of Patrimony to the class earlier and was eager to talk to the students. He led a frank and informal discus sion on the story, asserting that the book was easy to write but difficult to handle emotionally. The author told the class that half way between the time the brain tumor was first discovered and his father's death, he decided to write the story. Roth's stories are known for their autobiographical flavor, but he informed the class that Patri mony is the first novel in which the main character thoroughly repre sents himself. One member of the class described Roth's presentation as sincere and personable. Roth also answered a variety of questions about other aspects of his life. Responding to inquiries about his Bucknell experience, Roth asserted that Bucknell ""was very nice, and sometimes it was so nice it made you sick."" When asked if be ing Jewish had any effect on his Bucknell experience Roth stated that he encountered no prejudice during his years on campus. Roth also revealed to the class that he had given permission for Patrimony to be turned into a televi sion movie. He admitted that he had his doubts about the integrity of a television adaptation, but eventually determined that his enterprising dad would have been all for it."

BSG member Sandi Green '93 proposed the motion, stating that she was motivated by the ""po tential threat dogs pose to members of the Bucknell community."" The resolution also adheres to the safety concern for those students who have a fear of dogs. Green first recommended that BSG develop a plan to handle the dogs that roam the campus. After further discussion, a BSG member stated that the University has a leash policy which all com munity members must follow. The resolution was then changed to foster stricter enforcement. Security's policy states that if der around the Gateways and pose a threat to the children in the day care area nearby. ""I would hate to be reactive instead of proactive, and wait for something to happen to one of those kids before we do something,"" said Green. Nicole Yates '93, who sug gested that Green raise the issue during a BSG session, stated, ""I'm sick and tired of seeing dogs run around without leashes."" Yates ex pressed the concern that despite the policy of no dogs allowed indoors like the Langone Center, dogs en ter and create a potential heath and safety threat. Yates concluded, ""I don't like them, I'm afraid of them, and I think that their owners should be forced to keep them on a leash."" Peter Ho/The Bucknellian Bucknell Hall was packed Monday night as Philip Roth delivered a reading from his new book, Patrimony."

Bike thefts increase,"By Travis Elliott Staff Writer Six bicycles have been stolen from various bicycle racks at Bucknell over the past two weeks amounting to a total property value loss of over $2,600. According to James Middleton, Security Officer, the number of bicycle thefts have been ""excessive,"" despite the fact that all six of the bikes were re ported to have been securely locked by their owners. Middleton said, ""The offic ers in our student security are making visual checks of the bike racks more often,"" but he did rec ommend that students also make more frequent checks of their property. The Office of Security and Safety provides free bicycle regis tration, and according to Middleton, the office will be con ducting a registration drive in the Langone Center in the near future. Middleton noted that the Krypton or Cytadel horseshoe- shaped locks provide the most ef fective defense against theft, al though two of the bicycles stolen had been secured by those types of locks. Of the six bicycles stolen, four were mountain bikes and two were racing bicycles, all of which had been valued at over $300. Middleton asked that any students witnessing suspicious activities call the Office of Security and Safety immediately."

Iraq suppresses,
rebellion,"The Iraqi Army appeared Wednesday to have suppressed a month long civil war in Iraq. Presi dent Saddam Hussein's Government in Baghdad had been challenged by rebellions ever since Iraqi troops were driven from Kuwait last month by American-led forces. These rebellions were led by Shiite Muslims in southern Iraq and by Kurdish guerrillas in the north. The decrease of fighting in the south and the retreat of Kurdish rebels into the mountainous border with Turkey and Iran have led to the conclusion of the rebellion's suppression. In addition. Government troops have recaptured the major Iraqi cities. The Security Council has made progress in setting terms for a permanent cease-fire in the Persian Gulf war. The Bush administration maintains, however, that it has not changed its position concerning its refusal to commit American troops or military aid to the uprising. As of now, outside force will not be used to overthrow the Hussein Govern ment which, as it appears, have consolidated their hold on power."

Three protesters,
killed in Albania,"Three anti-Communist dem onstrators in Albania were killed and 30 others wounded when the Alba nian Army fired at the group of demonstrators Tuesday with rifles and a 20-millimeter cannon. The group was protesting the election of the Communist Party to power by sitting in the main square of the northern Albanian city of Shkoder. The protestors, enraged by the killings, set fire to two nearly ar mored personnel carriers and smashed many of the windows of Shkoder's Communist Party head quarters. Members of the crowd publicly denounced the Communist Party as well as Albania's President Ramiz Alia. Shkoder, a city of about 72,000, voted strongly in the elec tions for the three-month-old oppo sition Democratic Party. The sit- down strike in front of the Commu nist headquarters occurred when anti-Communists heard that a lead ing member of the Communist Party Politburo had said at a nationally televised news conference that his party remained Albania's dominant political force and that Albania would continue to be ruled by Marx ist-Leninist policies. The firing be gan after Albania's Army told dem onstrators to leave the square and they remained."
End of recession,
questioned,"The current recession seems to have started last August when the Persian Gulf crisis disturbed Ameri cans' outlook concerning business and jobs. With the successful end to the war in the Gulf, however, the possibility of a prompt economic recovery is being questioned. When Americans' confidence fell to its lowest level in a decade between August and October, con sumers reacted by cutting back sharply on big investment purchases, like cars and appliances. Businesses responded also by cutting invento ries and laying off workers. There have been many recent signs which promise economic re covery. Business executives are op timistic about future sales, but more importantly, consumers' expecta tions about future economic condi tions have greatly increased. Even with the arrival of these signs, how ever, economists do not forsec an economic recovery happening be fore summer. The reason being is that before a recovery can occur, businesses have to stop cutting jobs and start hiring again."

Drug agents,
seize 3 frats,"According to the Philadelphia Inquirer. Federal drug agents seized three University of Virginia frater nity houses in a raid on March 23. Three students were arrested on charges of drug distribution and nine others were being sought on the same charges. The 12 students, ages 19 to 23, were involved in multiple sales of small amounts of illegal drugs to undercover officers. The three fraternities which were raided included Delta Upsilon, Phi Epsilon, and Tau Kappa Epsilon. Items taken during the raid consisted of marijuana, hallucinogenic mush rooms, LSD tablets, scales, a mari juana growing system, and scores of pipes for smoking marijuana. The task force had been investigating drug traffic on campus since August, and this is the first such case in which fraternity houses were taken under federal control. Chess Club competed in a statewide Scholastic Chess Championship Tournament March 23-24 at Bloomsburg University. A total of 52 players living in the Central Pennsylvania area participated in this five game event There were six categories in which to compete. A total of 10 players competed in the ""OpenXUnrated"" section, including the four from Buckncll. Sophomore Basal Tayfun won first prize of $25 for his 3-2-0 first place finish and junior Jim Horsburgh won $15 for his 2-2-1 second place finish in the open sec tion. Junior Michael Bain and sophomore Aaron Cammarata won third and fourth in the open section, respectively, with records of 2-3-0 and 1-3-1, but received no cash prizes.

Doctors refuse,
Medicaid users,"Forty-four states have had problems getting doctors to partici pate in Medicaid, the health program for poor people. The reason for this is that Medicaid pays doctors much less than cither Medicare or private health insurers for the same service. As a result, many doctors are refus ing to take Medicaid patients. Medicaid is the Federal-state program for 27 million low-income Americans, including 13 millioh children. It has been discovered that Medicaid pays doctors only about 69 percent of what Medicare, the Fed eral health insurance program for 33 million elderly and disabled people, pays and an even smaller proportion of what private insurers pay. One reason for this comes from the way the programs are fi nanced. As opposed to Medicare which has its own federally con trolled trust funds, Medicaid de pends almost entirely on general federal and state revenues. States can pretty much decide on their own how much to pay in doctors' fees under Medicaid, allowing state Medicaid agencies to set the fees. Since these agencies often fail to update doctors' fees to account for inflation, Mcdic: aid sometimes ends up paying les$ than it costs doctors to perform cer tain services."

Former accountant finds that,
rare book collecting adds up,"By Sue Basalla Staff Writer If on graduation day in 1958 someone had told David Block that he would fill an order for President George Bush in 1989, the Com merce and Finance major would never have guessed that he would be supplying the president with a rare book. But the former accountant turned rare book dealer did just that, locating an 1872 edition of William Cullen Bryant's ""Picturesque America"" as a gift for President Gorbachev at the December summit in Malta. Although his college study prepared him to become an accoun tant in his family's firm, in 1979 Block opened ""The Book Block,"" an antiquarian bookselling business in Cos Cob, Connecticut. His wife, Shiu Min, an expert bookbinder and restorer, works next door to her hus band in the office built onto their home. As a merchant. Block's credo is ""Never the commonplace."" Find ing that the thrill of acquiring each book diminished as he discovered his second and third copies of a par ticular work, Block ""began to seek out the more esoteric and out-of-the- way items,"" taking the chance that customers might not share his inter est in them. The risk of buying ob scure books, however, contributed to the thrill of selling it to a pleased customer. Speaking from Connecticut last week, Block explained that he 1854, the manuscript documents Lincoln's arguments against the in stitution of slavery, [see box below] Having purchased the Lincoln manuscript at a Sotheby's auction for $82,500 in 1987, Block resold it for $150,00 in 1989."
Abraham Lincoln's notes on slavery,"If A. can prove, however conclusively, that he may, of right, enslave B., why may not B. snatch the same argument, and prove equally, that he may enslave A.? You say A. is white, and B. is black. It is color, then; the lighter, having the right to enslave the darker? Take care. By this rule, you are to be slave to the first man you meet, with a fairer skin than your own. You do not mean color exactly? You mean the whites are intel lectually the superiors of the blacks; and therefore have the right to enslave them? Take care again. By this rule, you arc to be slave to the first man you meet, with an intellect superior to your own. But, say you, it is a question of interest; and, if you can make it your interest, you have the right to enslave another. Very well. And if he can make it his interest, he has the right to enslave you. ""likes the book as a physical object. There must be something about the paper, type, printing, illustrations, binding, format, some physically at tractive attribute that speaks to me."" One of Block's most treasured items, a manuscript by Abraham Lincoln, was probably chosen for its historical importance rather than for its physical qualities. Written circa"
"Wine, dine and well...never mind","Scarlet D Tavern 264 Chestnut St. Mifflinburg, PA 966-3003 By Steve Hoerter and Julie Bachman Staff Writers Lacking the gumption to drive the 45 minutes to discover the next hot bed of culinary delight, Julie and Steve instead decided to re-evaluate the long-time Mifflinburg favorite. Scarlet D Tavern. Located mere yards before the first stop light on Route 45 in Mifflinburg, the Scarlet D pro vides a relaxed homey atmosphere for a satisfying dinner out on the town.The menu boasts a wide array of seafood, beef and poultry dishes, tantalizing appetizers and luscious desserts. Julie feasted upon the broiled chicken breast ($6.50), baked po tato and tossed salad. For an appe tizer, she sampled the shrimp cocktail ($6.00). Julie found the shrimp to have that ""fresh out of the ocean"" flavor. The chicken was tender and juicy, but Julie discovered the po tato to be just a bit too much to handle. The salad was hearty and provided just enough roughage for regularity. Steve, feeling wealthy and wanting to show off for the wait ress, ordered the surf and turf ($26.50). He found the 10 oz. lobster tail to be a tasty seafood treat. The 6 oz. steak, however, was a bit too mealy for Steve's taste -- and almost overshad owed the tastiness of the lobster tail. In addition to the Surf and Turf, Steve had a tossed salad and baked potato, which he found to be quite satisfactory. Julie and Steve recommend the Scarlet D Tavern with only one minor reservation -- watch out for that cut of beef! The menu is diverse and the prices are, on the whole, very reasonable. (They also have possession of a coveted liquor license -- the bar looks like a definite weekend possibil ity). D's is open for breakfast, lunch and, of course, dinner. Check it out!"

M A R T I  N ' S,
R  E S  SI,"Although such financial suc cess is vital for his business, Block derives greater satisfaction from ""finding a book a good home, where it will be well-read."" Referring to the recent sale of a Honus Wagner baseball card for $450,000, Block said that the outra geous price ""showed the foolishness to which collecting has come... Un like a book, a baseball card has no social or intellectual value. The price is indecently high and the only moti vation is the future appreciation as an investment."" Although Block has changed his priorities since his accountant days, his affection for books dates back to his sophomore year at Buck nell. Block credits Dr. Ralph Rees, emeritus professor of English, with developing his interest in literature. In 1960, after abandoning his accounting career. Block spent a year in Europe exploring classic art and literature. The experience, he said, ""convinced me that I wanted to make my life in the world of books and letters."" After earning his master's degree at New York Uni versity, Block taught for a year at Paddington Technical College in London and then at Kingman Walt Whitman College in New York. Block heard of the teaching position at Kingman from a gradu ate school friend, Shiu Min, then art director and assistant principal of Kingman. Married a year later, Block and Shiu Min began collect ing artwork. As they began to run out of wallspace, however, the Blocks began collecting illustrated books instead. This hobby, over the next decade, gradually developed into their antiquarian bookstore, ""The Book Block."" After their first few years of business, the Blocks decided to close the store and sell books only through mail-order catalogs. ""I'm not a mis anthrope,"" Block explained, ""I pre fer mailing out the catalogues and giving everyone a fair chance to buy what we have to offer."" Courtesy of Public Relations Majoring in Commerce and Finance at Bucknell, David Block '58 combined his business experience and love of books by opening his own rare book business. Block will give the LaFayette Butler Lecture Thursday, April 11 at 8 p.m. in the Traditional Reading Room of the Bertrand Library. Another change in the busi ness was Shiu Min's study of book- bindery. Frustrated at the length of time he had to wait for books to be bound, Block suggested that Shiu Min apply her artistic skills to the rare and difficult art of bookbinding. Since then, she has become a pre miere bookbinder, restoring books for sale and customizing certain edi tions for customers. The details of Block's journey from accounting to bookselling will be the subject of this year's LaFayette Butler Lecture, held Thursday, April 11, at 8 p.m. in the Traditional Reading Room of the Bertrand Library. The lecture is open to the public."

Three protesters,
killed in Albania,"Three anti-Communist dem onstrators in Albania were killed and 30 others wounded when the Alba nian Army fired at the group of demonstrators Tuesday with rifles and a 20-millimeter cannon. The group was protesting the election of the Communist Party to power by sitting in the main square of the northern Albanian city of Shkoder. The protestors, enraged by the killings, set fire to two nearly ar mored personnel carriers and smashed many of the windows of Shkoder's Communist Party head quarters. Members of the crowd publicly denounced the Communist Party as well as Albania's President Ramiz Alia. Shkoder, a city of about 72,000, voted strongly in the elec tions for the three-month-old oppo sition Democratic Party. The sit- down strike in front of the Commu nist headquarters occurred when anti-Communists heard that a lead ing member of the Communist Party Politburo had said at a nationally televised news conference that his party remained Albania's dominant political force and that Albania would continue to be ruled by Marx ist-Leninist policies. The firing be gan after Albania's Army told dem onstrators to leave the square and they remained."
End of recession,
questioned,"The current recession seems to have started last August when the Persian Gulf crisis disturbed Ameri cans' outlook concerning business and jobs. With the successful end to the war in the Gulf, however, the possibility of a prompt economic recovery is being questioned. When Americans' confidence fell to its lowest level in a decade between August and October, con sumers reacted by cutting back sharply on big investment purchases, like cars and appliances. Businesses responded also by cutting invento ries and laying off workers. There have been many recent signs which promise economic re covery. Business executives are op timistic about future sales, but more importantly, consumers' expecta tions about future economic condi tions have greatly increased. Even with the arrival of these signs, how ever, economists do not forsee an economic recovery happening be fore summer. The reason being is that before a recovery can occur, businesses have to stop cutting jobs and start hiring again."

Drug agents,
seize 3 frats,"According to the Philadelphia Inquirer. Federal drug agents seized three University of Virginia frater nity houses in a raid on March 23. Three students were arrested on charges of drug distribution and nine others were being sought on the same charges. The 12 students, ages 19 to 23, were involved in multiple sales of small amounts of illegal drugs to undercover officers. The three fraternities which were raided included Delta Upsilon, Phi Epsilon, and Tau Kappa Epsilon. Items taken during the raid consisted of marijuana, hallucinogenic mush rooms, LSD tablets, scales, a mari juana growing system, and scores of pipes for smoking marijuana. The task force had been investigating drug traffic on campus since August, and this is the first such case in which fraternity houses were taken under federal control. Chess Club competed in a statewide Scholastic Chess Championship Tournament March 23-24 at Bloomsburg University. A total of 52 players living in the Central Pennsylvania area participated in this five game event There were six categories in which to compete. A total of 10 players competed in the ""OpenXUnrated"" section, including the four from Buckncll. Sophomore Basat Tayfun won first prize of $25 for his 3-2-0 first place finish and junior Jim Horsburgh won $15 for his 2-2-1 second place finish in the open sec tion. Junior Michael Bain and sophomore Aaron Cammarata won third and fourth in the open section, respectively, with records of 2-3-0 and 1-3-1, but received no cash prizes.

Doctors refuse,
Medicaid users,"Forty-four states have had problems getting doctors to partici pate in Medicaid, the health program for poor people. The reason for this is that Medicaid pays doctors much less than cither Medicare or private health insurers for the same service. As a result, many doctors are refus ing to take Medicaid patients. Medicaid is the Federal-state program for 27 million low-incom? Americans, including 13 millioi) children. It has been discovered that Medicaid pays doctors only about 69 percent of what Medicare, the Fed eral health insurance program for 33 million elderly and disabled people, pays and an even smaller proportion of what private insurers pay. One reason for this comes from the way the programs are fi nanced. As opposed to Medicare which has its own federally con trolled trust funds, Medicaid de pends almost entirely on general federal and state revenues. States can pretty much decide on their own how much to pay in doctors' fees under Medicaid, allowing state Medicaid agencies to set the fees. Since these agencies often fail to update doctors* fees to account for inflation, Medic aid sometimes ends up paying les$ than it costs doctors to perform cerT tain services.

Former accountant finds that,
rare book collecting adds up,"By Sue Basalla Staff Writer If on graduation day in 1958 someone had told David Block that he would fill an order for President George Bush in 1989, the Com merce and Finance major would never have guessed that he would be supplying the president with a rare book. But the former accountant turned rare book dealer did just that, locating an 1872 edition of William Cullen Bryant's ""Picturesque America"" as a gift for President Gorbachev at the December summit in Malta. Although his college study prepared him to become an accoun tant in his family's firm, in 1979 Block opened ""The Book Block,"" an antiquarian bookselling business in Cos Cob, Connecticut. His wife, Shiu Min, an expert bookbinder and restorer, works next door to her hus band in the office built onto their home. As a merchant, Block's credo is ""Never the commonplace."" Find ing that the thrill of acquiring each book diminished as he discovered his second and third copies of a par ticular work, Block ""began to seek out the more esoteric and out-of-the- way items,"" taking the chance that customers might not share his inter est in them. The risk of buying ob scure books, however, contributed to the thrill of selling it to a pleased customer. Speaking from Connecticut last week. Block explained that he 1854, the manuscript documents Lincoln's arguments against the in stitution of slavery, [see box below] Having purchased the Lincoln manuscript at a Sotheby's auction for $82,500 in 1987, Block resold it for $150,00 in 1989."
Abraham Lincoln's notes on slavery,"If A. can prove, however conclusively, that he may, of right, enslave B., why may not B. snatch the same argument, and prove equally, that he may enslave A.? You say A. is white, and B. is black. It is color, then; the lighter, having the right to enslave the darker? Take care. By this rule, you are to be slave to the first man you meet, with a fairer skin than your own. You do not mean color exactly? You mean the whites are intel lectually the superiors of the blacks; and therefore have the right to enslave them? Take care again. By this rule, you are to be slave to the first man you meet, with an intellect superior to your own. But, say you, it is a question of interest', and, if you can make it your interest, you have the right to enslave another. Very well. And if he can make it his interest, he has the right to enslave you. ""likes the book as a physical object. There must be something about the paper, type, printing, illustrations, binding, format, some physically at tractive attribute that speaks to me."" One of Block's most treasured items, a manuscript by Abraham Lincoln, was probably chosen for its historical importance rather than for its physical qualities. Written circa"
"Wine, dine and well...never mind","Scarlet D Tavern 264 Chestnut St. Mifflinburg, PA 966-3003 By Steve Hoerter and Julie Bachman Staff Writers Lacking the gumption to drive the 45 minutes to discover the next hot bed of culinary delight, Julie and Steve instead decided to re-evaluate the long-time Mifflinburg favorite, Scarlet D Tavern. Located mere yards before the first stop light on Route 45 in Mifflinburg, the Scarlet D pro vides a relaxed homey atmosphere for a satisfying dinner out on the town.The menu boasts a wide array of seafood, beef and poultry dishes, tantalizing appetizers and luscious desserts. Julie feasted upon the broiled chicken breast ($6.50), baked po tato and tossed salad. For an appe tizer, she sampled the shrimp cocktail ($6.00). Julie found the shrimp to have that ""fresh out of the ocean"" flavor. The chicken was tender and juicy, but Julie discovered the po tato to be just a bit too much to handle. The salad was hearty and Steve, feeling wealthy and wanting to show off for the wait ress, ordered the surf and turf ($26.50). He found the 10 oz. lobster tail to be a tasty seafood treat The 6 oz. steak, however, was a bit too mealy for Steve's taste -- and almost overshad owed the tastiness of the lobster tail. In addition to the Surf and Turf, Steve had a tossed salad and baked potato, which he found to be quite satisfactory. Julie and Steve recommend the Scarlet D Tavern with only one minor reservation -- watch out for that cut of beef! The menu is diverse and the prices are, on the whole, very reasonable. (They also have possession of a coveted liquor license -- the bar looks like a definite weekend possibil ity). D's is open for breakfast, lunch and, of course, dinner. Check it out! provided just enough roughage for regularity. ^"

ft i m  S  S,"Although such financial suc cess is vital for his business, Block derives greater satisfaction from ""finding a book a good home, where it will be well-read."" Referring to the recent sale of a Honus Wagner baseball card for $450,000, Block said that the outra geous price ""showed the foolishness to which collecting has come... Un like a book, a baseball card has no social or intellectual value. The price is indecently high and the only moti vation is the future appreciation as an investment."" Although Block has changed his priorities since his accountant days, his affection for books dates back to his sophomore year at Buck nell. Block credits Dr. Ralph Rees, emeritus professor of English, with developing his interest in literature. In 1960, after abandoning his accounting career, Block spent a year in Europe exploring classic art and literature. The experience, he said, ""convinced me that I wanted to make my life in the world of books and letters."" After earning his master's degree at New York Uni versity, Block taught for a year at Paddington Technical College in London and then at Kingman Walt Whitman College in New York. Block heard of the teaching position at Kingman from a gradu ate school friend, Shiu Min, then art director and assistant principal of Kingman. Married a year later. Block and Shiu Min began collect ing artwork. As they began to run out of wallspace, however, the Blocks began collecting illustrated books instead. This hobby, over the next decade, gradually developed into their antiquarian bookstore, ""The Book Block."" After their first few years of business, the Blocks decided to close the store and sell books only through mail-order catalogs. ""I'm not a mis anthrope,"" Block explained, ""I pre fer mailing out the catalogues and giving everyone a fair chance to buy what we have to offer."" Courtesy of Public Relations Majoring in Commerce and Finance at Bucknell, David Block '58 combined his business experience and love of books by opening his own rare book business. Block will give the LaFayette Butler Lecture Thursday, April 11 at 8 p.m. in the Traditional Reading Room of the Bertrand Library. Another change in the busi ness was Shiu Min's study of book- bindery. Frustrated at the length of time he had to wait for books to be bound, Block suggested that Shiu Min apply her artistic skills to the rare and difficult art of bookbinding. Since then, she has become a pre miere bookbinder, restoring books for sale and customizing certain edi tions for customers. The details of Block's journey from accounting to bookselling will be the subject of this year's LaFayette Butler Lecture, held Thursday, April 11, at 8 p.m. in the Traditional Reading Room of the Bertrand Library. The lecture is open to the public."

Q: Is sophomore rush in the,
best interest of Bucknell?,
A: It just doesn't matter!,"The question is moot, and has been for nearly a year. President Sojka made his recommen dations for changes to the Greek system on May 1, 1990, but many fraternity and sorority na tional corporations have still failed to accept the finality of Bucknell's sophomore rush decision. The letter writing campaign begun recently by the nationals will do little more than re inflame the wounds that had just began to heal as the Greek controversy slowly dies. Do the nationals really believe that the trustees and President Sojka will back down on such a major tenet of their new social/residential plan, or are the national organizations more interested in dissuading other colleges from adopting ""The Bucknell Plan?"" Sophomore rush itself has yet to be explored at Bucknell, but now the issue has expanded into the-political question of ""who runs this University."" If Sojka and the trustees back down now, their action will be seen as succumbing to national pressure. Sojka has pleaded for the nationals to cooperate with the new system because he knows that without their support, the new system is destined to fail. Nevertheless, sophomore rush is here and won't be changed until it has at least been tried. The nationals, if they truly wanted to be malicious, could ask their alumni to withhold contributions from the University to make an example out of Bucknell. Clearly, the nationals have an interest in preventing the idea of sophomore rush from spreading to campuses like Bloomsburg, Colgate, and Glassboro. Why not make an example out of Bucknell--potentially the University that became financially troubled after it crossed fraternities and sororities? It is time for the nationals to stop their whining and cooperate with the new social/residen tial recommendations. After a trial period, it may again be time to reconsider the benefits of sophomore rush. If the fraternities and sororities on campus continue to fight the administration on this point, then these guests at our University should be asked to leave. Either way, Sojka is correct to firmly stand his ground, and his indignation is justified."

Student describes reaction,
to U.S. and war from abroad,"To the Editor: I am a Bucknellian currently studying abroad for the semester in Ireland. I just received a back issue of The Bucknellian (dated February 15th), and I wanted to respond to the various news on the Gulf War. Being abroad during this crisis has awarded me an excellent opportu nity to view the United States and its actions through the eyes of a neutral country. It has been, to say the least, a rude awakening. My experiences began on January 16th at a night club in Dublin. It was there that I (and a group of friends I was with) was informed the United States had just bombed Baghdad. Some young men who had recently arrived broke the news to us in this way: ""Are you American?"" They asked. ""Yes."" ""You just bombed Baghdad!"" ""Are there any casualties?"" ""American ones?"" ""Yes."" ""What does it matter if a few Yanks die, there are enough of you, anyways."" Needless to say, after feeling quite unwanted by these and others around us, we headed back to the youth hostel we were staying at (along with the other 75 Americans who were all there for our orienta tion). We watched CNN, which was connected to the Irish national network, with some English, Aus tralian and German students. They, as we, were appalled at the circus like coverage during the initial bombings. Also, many were quite incensed and resentful of Mr. Bush's impatience with the eco nomic sanctions and willingness to use force. is grateful for its ""Big Brother"" approach to foreign policy. On the contrary, they see right through the rhetoric and political smoke screens. They believe Americans are arrogant and full of themselves, especially when it comes to their interpretation of their place and ""duty"" in this world."
"The ""New World Order,"" the flag-waving,",
the glowing speeches to Congress and,
the congratulatory messages and pats,
on the back to the Allied soldiers just,
don't wash over here (in Ireland).,"I am writing this at a time when American public opinion of the President is soaring; he has come out of the war looking better than when he entered it. To the Irish and I dare say to other coun tries as well, however, he is still resented. The ""New World Order,"" the flag-waving, the glowing speeches to Congress and the con gratulatory messages and pats on the back to the Allied soldiers just don't wash over here. I do not think Americans realize that just because a country is neutral doesn't mean it automati cally, silently supports the U.S. and The main reason I am writing this is not to blast the Administra tion, or America for that matter. Rather, I wanted to give students what I have received while abroad: namely an inclination to reject American propaganda and the in formation spoon-fed to us by the media. The Irish, especially the students, have a tendency (as would citizens of any neutral country, I think) to be overly cautious when listening to leaders such as George Bush or John Majors. Instead, they approach each situation as unique and form an opinion based on the facts and contexts of that situation alone. Their opinions are not pre determined, rather they read, watch, listen and investigate for themselves. This political awareness is something I believe we, as Ameri cans, lack. A majority of the population is content to sit back and let their opinions be dictated to them. I have seen first-hand what it means to be politically aware. I was asked, usually right after meet ing not just students but families, shop-keepers, etc. what I thought about the Gulf situation. For the first time in my life I wasn't sur rounded with American propa ganda or Americans. A simple, ""Yes, I agree"" or ""No, I don't agree"" would not suffice, and I don't think it should in America, either. Next time someone asks you your opinion on any political issue, stop and think if you really have weighed the issues, if you even know what the issues aiPS, and if you are prepared to question the usual ""democratic"" or ""republican"" party line. A politically conscious population is, I believe, an asset to our country as a whole, as it will keep the government in check and force it, in turn, to examine each situation more closely.

Assistant football coach,
announces resignation,"To the Editor: It is with great feeling and emotion that I write to you. After spending ten of the most positive years of my life I have decided to leave Bucknell. This was the most difficult decision that I have ever made. I feel it is the right one for my family and myself. Ini- ~ 1 tially, I would like to ex press my appreciation for who you are and what you represent. The people at this Univer sity have always been the most -- important thing to me. You are great people. I consider myself fortu nate to have had the privilege to see many young men and women enter this school as freshmen and progress through their college careers. Some people consider it solely a pas sage of time. It is, more impor tantly, a passage of life. As an educator I value the chance to have an effect on the develop ment of any young person. At times in our profession as coaches we get too tied up with winning and losing and lose track of our task as role models and teachers. I constantly re mind myself of what is most important and hope that I will never lose focus of that fact. Another factor of great importance to me is the many things that a teacher can learn from his or her students. Though I do not know each and every one of you I have learned from you all. Your focus, your commitment, your resiliency, your toughness, your sensitivity, your patience, and most impor tantly your work ethic. You do all this while balancing time with the many demands of your academic life at Bucknell. I can only hope that I have been able to serve you equally. I am privileged to teach. This letter cannot express ten years of feelings. The highs and lows, more importantly, the many rewards of working with you. I want it to express ten years of appreciation. I wish you all the very best. Thank you for who you are, what you are, where you are going, and how you are getting there. Joseph G. Susan, Jr. Assistant Head Football Coach March 25,1991"

If that is true, then I know that there is God out there somewhere, because, boy oh boy, did poor President Sojka get what he deserved. Through a combination of naivete, putting his trust in incompetents, and pure gut lessness Sojka finds himself in a royal mess. A little less than a year ago Sojka's ""grand plan"" for single- handedly reshaping the ""social/resi dential"" system was presented to the students and faculty with a reception worse than that received by Rosanne Barr's stirring rendition of the na tional anthem. Now, Sojka is feeling the heat from fraternity and sorority nationals to change yet another tenet of the plan, sophomore rush. Un derstandably, he is pissed. He's mad because several other facets of his pathetic plan have been no less pathetically slimed out of by the students, specifically by the high and mighty TIP task force, and now this one may go by the wayside as well. The problem, though, is not the specific sophomore rush pro posal. Although its inanity is self- evident, it is merely a symptom. Sophomore rush was the bone Sojka threw to the faculty. What he prob ably does not understand to this day is that instead of pleasing both fac tions, the greeks and the faculty, he / ----------------------------------- \"

Drum,By Marc Haimes
V,"___________________ / My cousin Decker was only three and didn't really understand the joke, but would still toddle over to all the relatives wiggling his plump butt and babble, ""Whath bwack and wite and wed all ova?"" in a sing-song voice. ""I DON'T KNOW!"" declared grandma in wide-eyed suspense, even though he had just told her two minutes ago. ""I'LL BET ONLY A"
BIG BOY KNOWS THE ANSWER,"TO THAT!"" She tussled his hair greatly angered each group. Sojka's recommendations were a non-sequitur to the faculty's motion. The motion that passed was based on principles. Whether or not it was correct, the sentiments of the faculty could not be appeased by such whorish tactics. Evidence of this is that the faculty does not even care any more. They are not in volved in implementing the changes because they did not ask for them. They asked for a type of thinking that Sojka, the consummate politi cian, could not comprehend even if it kicked him in the ass. It is understandable why the students are upset. Our very way of living, a way of living that we de fended in the intellectual tradition of all the great Sophists, was, and is, at stake. And now, it seems that we will have the last laugh by denying our fine institution its endowment. That's what's going on. The frater nity nationals (and to a lesser extent sorority nationals) were scared about the possibility that this plan would spread to other colleges. So they petitioned their alumni not to con tribute unless sophomore rush was changed. What student concern could not change, money could. Now Sojka must cave in yet again. It seems that he will lose the battle of the crybabies, or at the very least, end up crying more. The irony of this is that the re nowned ""Sojka plan"" developed be- and pinched his chubby cheeks. He giggled hysterically in an ticipation. ""A NEWTHPAPER!"" He screamed triumphantly, wetting his pants for the third time that day. All the grandparents cracked up and said things like, ""He's so adorable... and smart too.. .I'll bet he becomes president!"" Decker wasn't really listening because he was busy stuffing the chocolates and maraschino cherries they had given him into his mouth. He chewed his prizes into a reddish brown goop. Then suddenly he burst out laughing again spraying the mostly masticated mixture into the air and onto the rug. The rela tives cackled and clapped their hands delightedly. As if John Kennedy had risen from the grave, shook their hands, and regurgitated reddish brown goop on the floor. Decker, enjoying everyone's cause he could not hold firm to his original ""vision."" President Sojka is a man with delusions of grandeur. His first revelation was to make all Greek organizations go co-ed. He did this without even endeavoring to ask the one fraternity with a co-ed history (Phi Lamda Theta, now Chi Phi) about the myriad of problems that arose out of that arrangement. Thankfully, about a week before the long awaited ""Open Forum,"" Sojka kowtowed to pressure from Greek nationals and abandoned this no less idiotic proposal. Waiting in the wings to step in and pick up the pieces was Sojka's trusted ingenue, Vice President Charlotte Jacobsen-Weddle. Weddle permitted Sojka to hold on to his infantile delusions while ad vancing her own agenda. Weddle, at least as much as Sojka, formulated the recommendations, and, was in stalled as co-head of the TIP task force. Weddle's role in the ""Gen esis"" of the social/residential system is common knowledge. One cannot help but to feel sorry for Sojka. After all, he did not act maliciously, and in fact he is a very nice man. But, he caused the dilemma he now faces. He was na ive by trying to compromise be tween the students and the faculty. This was fundamentally impossible given the faculty's moral objections to the Greek system. Right or wrong undivided attention, scuttled to me next. I was twelve. Too old to be cute and too young to be respected. I sat in the comer relishing my pre- pubescent misery. ""Whath Bwack and Whith and wed all ova?"" he demanded gripping my knees. The room hushed as ev eryone _w?ited breathlessly for his answer. ""That's such a dumb joke."" I told him. ""Everybody knows it."" Why don't you learn a new one and stop being such a little brat... "" Later that night, they visited my room, where I had been ban ished, and requested that I apologize to the little monster. ""But why?"" I protested. ""I was only being honest You always made it clear that honesty=goodness. Remember?"" My response elicited no sym- in this case, morals cannot be com promised, and Sojka failed to realize that. He put his trust in someone he ought not have, Charlotte Jacosbcn- Weddle. It is ironic how his confi dante is now leaving due to ""per sonal reasons."" Sorry Sojka, that leaves you holding the bag. pathy and I was deeply confused... about ""goodness"" and ""badness."" Still am today. Take these new events in Iraq for example. Before this rebellion stuff, everything was very simple... Iraqi's were bad because they were invading a foreign country and being mean to people. Hussein, the Iraqi leader, was especially bad, because he was VERY mean to people. He is also fat and ugly and has a first name that sounds like ""Sodomy."" George Bush was good because he was willing to stand up for his beliefs and take any action that would stop the bad men and their satanic leader from being mean with big brown bombs sprayed in the air. The Saudi Arabians were good because, even though they treat women like used Kleenexes, they were helping the Americans/good guys kill the Iraqi/ bad guys. When Americans (good) Finally, Sojka was gutless. Every proposal he made he has caved in on. But this is not the big gest area where Sojka showed him self to be made of the same fiber as ""brave brave Sir Robin, brave Sir Robin (who) ran away."" Last spring Sojka had to make a decision. He could not cut the baby in half. But, beat the hell out of the Iraqi's (bad) it was a triumphant time for all. And we cackled and clapped our hands delightedly in praise of our leader. Recently, we have discovered that Sa-DAMN Hussein is, in fact, STILL being mean to people. But now because of this new cease fire (good), the Americans (good) are no longer allowed to stop Satan Hussein from doing these downright nasty things. At first, I thought the reason for this inaction on the part of the good guys was because the people getting tortured and killed were Iraqi's (bad). After all, we killed one or two before and it was no big deal. But this can't be right because these Iraqi's were actually encouraged by the Americans (good in case you've forgotten) to fight against Sadman Hussein. Making this particular group of Iraqi's good. This means it's not okay to kill them. alas, he tried to do so. Now the Greek system holding one bloody half wants to get back the other since the faculty has had the grace to walk away without theirs. Sojka, you are definitely no Solomon, you God damn deserve what you got yourself into. Which means allowing it to happen would be. . . no wait a minute I'm missing something here. Things seem to have become very complicated all of a sudden. Where is the simple scenario every one believed in when we were ""kicking ass"" and taking a stand against cruelty and injustice just a few weeks ago? I mean, if the situ ation has always been this intricate and there were, in fact, one or two people who may not have been completely bad getting killed, then we probably shouldn't have been so blindly ""euphoric"" for these past few weeks. But we couldn't help getting excited! After all Bush's plan to de stroy the Iraqi army and stop the ter ror worked so brilliantly... Oh well. It seems like nothing is black or white. Just red all over."

Should condoms be available on campus,
to students?,"Kathy Gallo '92 Psychology With obvious health risks, condoms are the best way to practice safe sex. We are all adults at this school. If we make the choice to have sex, the op portunity to have safe sex should be available. The availability of condoms in dormitories makes it more convenient for us to have safe sex. V______________________ Darrin Weber '91 Computer Science I believe condoms should be avail able to students on campus. The easy accessibility is important because of all the concerns about STD's or AIDS. Beth Birdsey '94 Elementary Education College students are legal adults making (supposedly) adult deci sions. While the inconvenience of buying condoms may hinder younger students from having sex, that doesn't apply here. So, yes, condoms should be availbale on campus. It won't promote sex, it will promote concern for safety, and it will discourage careless sex. Tim Emmett '91 Economics/Philosopy As a Christian who believes that premarital sex is wrong, I couldn't be consistent with my beliefs and support the availability of condoms on campus. Furthermore, I don't think most Bucknellians have a difficult time geting condoms if they really want them. Shanna Gemmill '92 Management Condoms should be available to students so as to continually pro mote safe sex, thereby avoiding unwanted pregnancy and disease. Evan Lippman '91 Political Science Of course, it's only sex. If safe sex is going to be practiced, putting condoms in dorms or on halls just makes it convenient for all concerned."

Taking Care of Business,"By M arc Haimes Staff Writer Despite its trite title and unoriginal "" rich guy meets poor guy"" premise. Taking Care of Business actually boasts some good gags, zesty corporate satire, and a few surprisingly bittersweet moments; sending a 90's style fax to the traditional Trading Places type agenda. With the hokey theme song blaring in the background, we meet a wealthy, anal yuppie (Charles Grodin, Midnight Run), the type of guy who interrupts a passionate bathroom romp with his spouse to make sure his file-o-fax style date book is safe. Next comes the jocular yet sensitive, incarcerated car-thief (James Belushi, Saturday Night Live ) who seems to be able to handle any situation with a boy ish smirk and a clever quip allud ing to various parts of the feminine anatomy. Before the opening mu sic even gets to the guitar solo, the yuppie, who has been ditched by his neglected wife, goes to L .A ., loses his datebook with his I.D ., and ends up in a slum. The car- thief, who has broken out of jail so he can see the World Scries, goes to L .A ., finds the datebook with the I.D ., and ends up in a corporate mansion. Grodin digs deep into his briefcase of pathetic facial expres sions as he is mugged, arrested, and generally harassed by the L .A . population. Meanwhile, Belushi lends his impish/obnoxious charm to the business world. ""Here's to the Cubs winning the World Se- ries....and Big Tits,"" he toasts at a stuffy business dinner before mak ing cute ""goggle-eye"" expressions and suggestive gestures at the boss's beautiful dental-floss-bi- kini-clad daughter. The film  picks up when Grodin and Belushi meet and com bine their eclectic talents to as suage the confusion caused by their changed identities. The two come dians work well together and create a believable and sensitive (in a glossy, '90's kind o f way) relation ship. There is even a touching final scene with a cute puppy and a cry ing woman. As Grodin and Belushi drive off into the sunset in their snappy red sports car, we feel confident that our ex-con has become more mature and, perhaps, slightly less sexist. Our yuppie has learned that being anal can get banal; take your life lightly and relish the simple joys. If you're into light entertain ment and simple joys, then pencil Taking Care of Business onto your datebook."

11,"Courtesy of the Dept, of Theatre & Dance Suzanne Hawe, guest choreographer for the Spring Weekend musical A History o f the American Film, will also teach open classes in musical dance styles and tap dance. Dance Machine was what she now refers to as ""a classic dancer story."" She happened to walk into a re hearsal on the day that one of the lead dancers had quit, just four days before a national tour was to begin. She was allowed to stay for the day's rehearsal, and then to join the com pany. It was ""a trial by fire,"" Hawe says, but a successful one, and she launched into what would be a long and productive relationship with the company. A  com ic survey o f classic Am erican film s from the early 1920's to the 1970's, A History of the American Film has provided Hawe with teaching and choreo graphing opportunities similar to her work in Dance Machine. The com pany often recreated characters and scenes to support their dance recon structions, producing shows that were as much like musicals as dance concerts. Hawe's experience with historical periods of American dance has given her the expertise needed to set A History of the American Film in motion. Hawe especially enjoys the opportunity to collaborate with di rector Gary Grant. "" Working by yourself is like working in a void,"" she says, and "" working with a di rector is always a collaborative ef fort"" She and Grant work together to achieve dynamic staging for the entire show, using each other as ""another pair of eyes,"" as Hawe puts it ""When you are choreographing a musical, you always have to be in sync with the director."" Three other guest artists join Hawe in the production team of A History o f the American Film . Lighting designer Peter Anderson, who received his Master o f Fine Arts degree from New York University School o f the Arts, has designed off- Broadway, in regional theatres, and for numerous dance com panies. Costume designer Wendy R olf, a former student o f director Gary Grant who received her Master of Fine Arts in design from the Yale School of Drama, has designed cos tumes for both Him and stage. Mu sical Director and pianist Andrew Levine has worked in regional and stock companies and also enjoys teaching at the university level. All four artists are guest lec turing in various classes in the de partment o f theatre and dance. Suzanne Hawe will teach a series of classes in various dance styles from television to film and stage begin ning today and continuing Friday, Apr. 12 & 19, from 1:00 to 2:30 p.m. in Tustin Dance Studio. She will also teach a tap dance class tomorrow and Saturday, Apr. 13 & 20, from 10:00 to 11:30 a.m . in the Fieldhouse Dance Studio. Both classes arc free and open to the public; call xl235 for more information. A History of the American Film will be performed on Apr. 26, 27,28, and 29 at 8 p.m. in the Uni versity Theatre in Coleman Hall. Tickets are $3.50 (with a $2.50 stu dent discount on Sunday and Mon day) and will go on sale at the L .C . Box Office on Monday, April 8. The production is co-sponsored by the Department of Theatre and Dance and Cap and Dagger with additional funding provided by B S G , C O SP , and the Bucknell Association for the Arts."

The diVinyls aim,
for mass appeal,
Australian band releases album,"By Matthew P. Wood Staff Writer Rock fans, meet the diVinyls. No, this is not exactly the Australian band's first at-bat in the big league; however, this is not the same band that made a small name for itself with its first album, Des perate, in 1983. The new album, simply entitled diVinyls, is clearly an effort to arouse mass appeal. The first cut, ""I Touch Myself,"" has rather masterfully succeeded in doing just that, but the question remains, does the rest of the album meet up to the racy, guiltless charm of this.single? The group features vocalist Christina Amphlett and guitarist Mark McEntcc, but it is undoubt edly Amphlctt's singing that sus tains the music. Her raspy yet soothing delivery breathes sexual ity, and not surprisingly, the songs that take advantage of this most are the ones that stick. ""I Touch M y self,"" with its openly arousing theme, is a prime example of this. Two other promising tracks at the beginning of the album, "" Lay Your Body Down"" and ""Love School,"" employ a similar approach. In the case of these song#, Amphlett's voice in combination with a few catchy riffs is more than enough to satisfy a listener. What is unfortunate is that much of the rest o f the album seems to float around with very little to say musically or otherwise. Although McEntee's guitar work is for the most part solid, the group simply lacks the firepower to sus tain a song like "" Bless M y Soul (It's Rock-n-Roll)."" Such tracks would probably be better left to a testosterone-charged band like AC/ D C . One o f the few redeeming songs is the second to last track entitled "" Bullet."" Like "" I Touch Myself,"" the song is cleverly writ ten and performed and could prove to be a real gem on mainstream AOR radio. The potential of the diVinyls is evidenced by the flashes of truly flavorful pop rock that are pre sented. On the other hand, the lack of continuity suggests something else. Are they interested in keeping old fans or making new ones? Un til the diVinyls choose a direction and commit to it, they may find their luck best in the singles mar ket."

Former Nikolais Dance Theatre,
member to teach this weekend,"By Ashley Shrader Staff Writer Choreographer, teacher and dancer Robert Esposito, formerly with the Nikolais Dance Theatre, will teach a master class in basic modem technique Sunday, April 7 at 6 p.m. in Tustin Dance Studio. Esposito, cited by Gisela D 'Andrea of the St. Paul Dispatch as a ""major shape changer in mod em dance,"" realized his passion for dance after seeing a performance given by the Nikolais Dance The atre. In 1971, after spending years of intense training, Esposito joined Nikolais' company. During his nine year member ship with Nikolais Dance Theatre, Esposito developed into an expres sive and capable featured soloist. He toured worldwide with the company and, in his final appearances with NDT, was awarded guest artist sta tus. In 1980, he left NDT to co-found the Fusion Foundation for Dance Inc. While spending time as a fac ulty guest artist at various locations, Esposito continued to tour through out North and South America and Europe as a guest artist. Recently, Esposito has been acting as the artistic director of the Esposito Dance Theatre.

Prisoners' constitutional and human,
rights defended by local volunteers,
Lewisburg Prison Project staffed by students,
",",
faculty and townspeople,"By Jennifer Breheny Staff Writer A poster that reads: ""Blind Justice.. .out of sight, out of mind, out of date"" hangs on a door in the headquarters of the Lewisburg Prison Project (LPP) and serves as a motto for the volunteers of the spe cial program. The six Buckncll stu dents and ten adults that run the LPP work to secure prisoner rights be hind the walls of the Lewisburg Federal Penitentiary. The Lewisburg Penitentiary is a federal maximum security prison for adult males. These men, many of whom do not hold high school di plomas, rely on the volunteers to help convey their frustrations and mistreatments to those who can help change their conditions. According to Karl Patten, pro fessor of English and an active vol unteer of the LPP, the volunteers ""work to protect prisoners' constitu- over the whole prison, adds Patten. The workers at the LPP re ceive at least 20 letters a week from prisoners expressing their problems, some of which include overcrowd-"

Protective custody is another problem that prisoners address in their letters to the LPP. One man writes that he fears for his life be cause he is behind the same bars as the men that he ""sold-out"" in court. Afraid of retaliation, he refuses to go into the ""population"" (mix with the other prisoners). He has asked the prison au thorities to shield him from his en emies by providing him with protec tive custody. Thus far, his request has been denied because he refuses to ""name names."" When he is asked to go to his prison job or the cafete ria, he refuses. Each refusal costs him 30 days in segregation and a loss of important ""good time"" which earns a prisoner early parole. The LPP has filed a class ac tion suit against the prison. The case has not yet been heard."
Victorian era recreated at Slifer House Museum,"By David Murray Staff Writer Returning from the battle fields of the Civil War in 1850, Colonel Eli Slifer built a mansion in Lewisburg so beautiful that the 1862 Godey's Lady Book cited it as an example of impressive architecture. Following Slifer's death in 1888, the mansion served as the Evangelical Association's home for the aged, as well as a hospital and an orphanage. Since 1975, how ever, the home has been restored to the Victorian style, recreating the original splendor of the mansion in careful detail. The Slifer House has been preserved as a museum and is listed in both the Pennsylvania and Na tional Registers of Historic Places. The Victorian exterior of Slifer House has been perfectly mir rored in the interior furnishings. From the well-worn, turn-of-the- ccntury leather couch in the sitting room, to the walk-out second-story windows that lead to the shaded ve randa, examples of Victorian life and culture abound. Each room is filled with Vic torian artifacts and momentos con tributed by local residents or crafts men. Visitors find items as varied as a civil war amputation kit and a gi ant, still-useable music box, a child's doll house and an antique curling iron. Hcnnie Inkrotc, a tour guide at Slifer House, shows visitors the par lor, kitchen, bedrooms, and her fa-"

CWRJJ,
Collegiate Perspective,
(and other fairy tales),"By Peter Lalos Staff Writer Springtime at Buckncll Uni versity means that the minds of all college students will soon be turn ing to... final exams. But that's not quite the point that I'm getting at. No, spring means a time for re newed romances after a long, frigid winter of lonely nights and doing the social scene thing solo. It's about at this point in the year, in fact, when mating season begins for all of God's creatures, and around campus you start to feel as if you need a score card to see who's scoring. Well, let's see if we can put together a clear picture of ex actly what types of pairings you'll be running into for the rest of the year. 1) ""The __ Lockhorns"" couple: This duo is basically to- gether for the purpose of making each other's life miserable. Their relationship is most often charac terized by: 1) two-hour long tele phone brouhahas which invariably end in one of them slamming down the receiver in exasperation, claim ing that hc/shc will never speak to the other again; 2) downright ugly spats during otherwise fun social events which effectively spread their misery to each and every one of their friends in attendance, thereby ruining everyone's time; and 3) mutual physical abuse, such as the hurling of lawn furniture, framed pictures of their high school prom, and various pieces of farm ing equipment at each other no less frequently than once a month. All of these abuses seemingly fall by the wayside, however, because deep down this couple really does love each other. Uh, yeah. Prospects for the future: Annoyingly enough, the success rate for this class is surprisingly high among college-age students-- apparently, masochism is the func tional word here. Exceptions to this rate are usually attributed to suicide by one partner in a fit of emotional distress over the relationship's lat est fight, or the homicidal death of one of the two people (committed by the other partner, of course). 2) ""Copulation Makes the World Go 'Round"" couple: The couples do on dates. They just- well, they just do the dirty deed. Prospects for the future: 50- 50. On the down side, the female will get pregnant, and the male partner will exert his fine sense of adult responsibility and bolt before the c.p.t. dot turns pink. On the other hand, he will stay with her they'll both drop out of college, opt for the shotgun marriage, and will live on food stamps for the rest of their lives with their 17 children The option of abortion could also be taken, if the female's fear of the clinic being bombed by pro-lifers during the procedure is not too great to overwhelm her fear of be ing put behind the eight ball for the rest of her life by having a child she can't support, even if the husband decides to live up to his actions and stay with her. Whether they stick it out or not, two aspects of this type of relationship are definite: 1) the female will inevitably become pregnant, and 2) one or both of them will eventually be pouring out the events of their sordid union on The Oprah Winfrey Show at some point in the future and receive un due clucks of sympathy from the studio audience for their plight. 3) ""Kiss Kiss. Wuv You Snookums"" couple: This rela tionship is characterized by its unique ability to make you regur gitate upon seeing its partners' ex traneous adoration for one another. Earmarks of this bothersome couple include hand-holding wher ever they go (while getting the mail, etc.), ""I don't give a flying fart if you see us "" smooching in public, and/or the usage of entirely unneeded nicknames for each other (c.g., ""sugar tushie"", ""the sole rea son I continue respirating"", ""my big/little snuggle pouch""). Prospects for the future: Unlikely to last due to extreme ar tificiality. One or both people dies of diabetes... we hope. 4) ""Romeo and Ju liet"" cement that holds this pair together is sex-- nothing else. There is a very definite line between love and lust, and this type of bond exempli fies this fact to a tee. They don't watch movies together, or out to restaurants to eat, or go to parties with one another like normal"
V,"couple: Seeing this pair together just makes you feel good all over. Wherever they go, children are frolicking in the tall cattails, the sun is shining gaily, and some dog named Wuf is happily chasing its tail. Basically, knowing a Romeo and Juliet couple gives us all hope and inspiration for our own ro mantic endeavors. They look good together, they have the same inter ests, and they make an unbeatable team in Pictionary. Prospects for the future: Can't miss. A done deal. Almost mythical in how right the relation ship seems. It's just... wow."

Men's lax to play Holy Cross tomorrow,
Team optimistic after competitive play in season openers against top-rated teams,"By Jamie Diareria Staff Writer The Bison Men's Lacrosse team (0-3) remained winless this season after losing to Army 19-6 on Saturday. The team looks to get on track when they play Holy Cross tomorrow. Head Coach Sid Jamieson continues to remain opti mistic about the team's play as he strives for the Patriot League title. The Bison played their first Patriot League team when they took on Army. Thus far the Bison have had the misfortune of playing three of the top eleven teams in the coun try in Georgetown, Princeton, and Army. As a result, the team has struggled to get their first win. The game was somewhat un usual, according to Jamieson. After being tied 2-2 during the first quar ter, Army exploded for eight unan swered goals. Suddenly down 10-2, the Bison failed to stay competitive. They did manage to generate some offense, but the six goals they scored were not enough to put a dent into the Army lead. Goals were scored for the Bi son by Garret Schwartz '91, who led the way for the Bison with two goals while co-captain Tom Davis *91, Doug DePietro '92, Todd Streelman '93, and Chuck Twoguns '93 tallied one apiece. Colin Barker '94 played three quarters in goal, stopping 20 shots and allowing 18 goals. Matt Wojnovich '94 played the final quarter, stopping two shots while al lowing one goal. According to Jamieson, the team is only slightly behind sched ule this season, and that they did as well as could be expected against the tough Army team. ""We started out playing well and then there were the eight goals in a row. Unfortunately they pressed and held us."" Jamieson wishes to remain positive about the season, and says that the Bison have been doing a few things very well thus far. fnPsflfi i Colin Barker '94 has been one of the bright spots for the inexperi enced Bison squad. Against Georgetown, Barker recorded 17 saves Colin Bridgewater/The Bucknellian Kevin Roth '92, seen here making an attack on the goal against Georgetown. Bucknell had battled back from deficits the entire game before falling 10-9. ""Our face-offs have been excellent,"" he said. The main problem that has hindered the Bison has been scoring. After losing several of their domi nant scorers this season, the team has not established that aspect of their game. ""I knew it would be difficult this year,"" said Jamieson. ""We lost all of our scoring power."" Jamieson is looking now for the team to pick up its first win in an attempt to instill some confidence in the players. ""We have a good team,"" he said. ""Things just haven't come together as quickly as we had hoped. We have a competitive schedule, and I feel that as soon as we win our first game and get over the hump, things will tum around for us. As a young team, all we need is confidence and experience."" Co-captain Pat Sheridan '91 feels that the team will come around in the future. ""I feel pretty optimis tic about the rest of the season. We have a couple of freshmen who have played some key roles this season. Our goalies [Wojnavich and Barker] have been coming along well. It's unfortunate that our toughest games have all come in the first few weeks. Our losses have definitely not been due to a lack of work, though. We've practiced hard. I think that once we get into a"
"Softball, 9-4-1, sweeps St. Francis","By Todd Bianchine Staff Writer The women's softball team boosted its record to 9-4-1 for the season by sweeping a doubleheader against SL Francis on Wednesday 9- 1 and 8-4. Sharon Nichols '91 picked up her fourth win in the first game, allowing only five hits and striking out nine in seven innings of work. Lisa Fink '93 got her third win in the second game, giving up only two hits while striking out six. St. Francis put up a run on the board early against Nichols to take a 1-0 lead in the first inning, but the Lady Bison responded by scoring a run in the second, two in the third and fourth, and four more in the bot tom of the fifth inning. Heather Hoehn '94, who was baiting .545 going into the game, led the offen sive attack by batting 3 for 4 with two doubles and two RBI. Second- baseman Jen Kalochie '91 went 1 for 3, bringing in two runners of her own. The one-two combination did the majority of work on the offensive end in the second game as leadoff hitter Jen Yuengling '93 and Kalochie combined for two runs and four RBI and had three of the team's eight hits to pace Bucknell to the 8-4 victory. The rest of the team did their share by taking six free passes on walks and allowing St. Francis pitcher Melissa Freedman no strikeouts for the entire game. Before the St. Francis games the team enjoyed a successful road trip over spring break in Myrtle Beach, S.C., posting a 6-2 record for the week. Bucknell lost to the host team Coastal Carolina twice, 1 -0 and 7-1, but swept each of the three New York teams; SUNY-Albany, SUNY- Stony Brook, and Kings College, outscoring the teams by a combined 69-11.

!SS|!I!E,"more regular schedule in April, things will improve."" The Bison will have their first real opportunity for a victory when the face Holy Cross on Saturday. The Crusaders are struggling this season as well, posting a record of 0- 4 . Jamieson stressed that this game will be the first true ""Patriot League type game"" in that they will be con siderably less competitive. ""They have the same type program as us. We hope that this will be the game where we tum things around."" The schedule for the rest of the year will not be kind to the Bison, as they will be playing top ranked teams for the rest of the season. ""Our program is challenging,"" Jamieson remarked. ""We could play a schedule where we win seventy- five to eighty percent of our games. That's not our goal. We try to play the schools like Towson which will provide us with a challenge."" Jamieson feels that despite the difficulty of the schedule, the Bison have the potential to finish first or second in the Patriot League. ""It's never easy to finish .500 [for the season]. We just need to find our selves. I'd like to win the Patriot League. Army will be tough for anyone to beat, though."" Despite going winless in their first three games, the Bison feel that Colin Bridgewater/The Bucknellian while allowing ten goals. Barker has started all three games this sea son, recording 61 saves while allowing 45 goals. things are on the verge of turning all the team needs is some experi- around. A difficult schedule and poor offense have both combined to hurt the team, but Jamieson feels that enee before they become a force in the league."
G olf splits first tw o,"By Chris Drowne Staff Writer While most of us were seeking sand and water these past couple of weeks, the golf team tried its best to avoid them. Head Coach Tommy Thompson's young squad (four freshmen, zero seniors) teed off its season in North Carolina before re turning north to Lewisburg. North Carolina's vast Woodlakes Country Club was the site of the season-opening Woodlakes Invitational. The Bison finished fourth out of the six schools, ahead of Brown and Lebanon Val ley. Lehigh, Frederick, and Lafayette grabbed first through third places, respectively. Zach Vogel '93 and Doug Dollenberg '94 each shot 172 for the two-round tournament to lead the Bison. Only two of the 36 compet ing golfers managed to break 80 on the par 72 course during the first round. Glenn Hertzberg '92 (175) and Don Hansen '94 (177) rounded out Bucknell's scorers. ""It was extremely windy and this was the first time we teed it up this year,"" said Thompson. The winds followed the team north for its home opener Tuesday against Lehigh and Lock Haven. The Bison, who defeated Lock Ha ven by 23 strokes, fell to the Engi neers, 102-116. The 14 stroke gap was a significant improvement upon the 58 stroke difference between the two Patriot League rivals at the Woodlakes Invitational less than a week before. ""If we can continue to im prove as the younger players adjust, as well as get some consistency up and down the lineup, we can com pete,"" added Thompson. Once again, Dollenberg led the way with an 81 as only two strokes separated the top four Bison finishers, Hertzberg, Hansen, (the top scorer this past fall) and captain Michael Smigic'92. Lehigh's John Logue, gold-medalist at Woodlakes, led all golfers with a 77. The team hopes to improve upon its one-and-one record when it hosts Lafayette, Ryder, and Swarthmore next Tuesday. ""Our guys are capable of im proving and shooting down in the seventies. We just have to avoid counting those scores in the mid- to high eighties,"" concluded Thomp son."
Rugby moves to 2-0,"Colin Bridgewater/The Bucknellian Karen Smolskis '91 connects for one of her three hits in the team's season opener against Hofstra. By Mitch Benton Staff Writer Sophomore Howie Fetzer's three second-half field goals led the Bucknell Men's Rugby Club to their second consecutive victory of the young spring season. The All- Blacks followed last week's 50-0 mauling of Dickinson College with a hard fought, 9-8 victory over their traditional rival, Lafayette College. Bucknell was forced to come back twice in the match, held at Lafayette, and came through on both occasions as Fetzer provided all of the scoring. Lafayette scored the first points in the match midway through the first of the two forty-minute halves. The Leopard forwards won possession of the ball deep in their own zone and quickly relayed it out to their backs. Eventually they worked it to the outside center who used fakes and outstanding speed to cover the length of the field. After the missed point, the score stood at 4-0, where it stayed for the duration of the half, despite a number of All- Black scoring opportunities. The team missed a pair of field goals against a strong wind as well failing to capitalize on numerous chances on the Lafayette goal. Bucknell opened their scoring early in the second half on the first of the three-pointers and looked to take the lead for good on the second. Once again, Lafayette proved their mettle on another long scoring run by the outside center. Buckncll's forwards had won the ball in a line out, but quickly gave up possession to the Leopards who broke through the All-Black's defense for their second score. Fortunately for the visitors, the point after try barely missed the uprights and Bucknell was within two points, 8-6. The All-Black's forwards re deemed themselves on the next se ries. They won possession of the ball on a scrum-down and drove within Lafayette's 22-metcr line. The home squad looked to have silenced the threat with a kick, but the referee called an off-sides penalty, therby giving Fetzer his third opportunity. The kick split the uprights and Bucknell only liad to run out the clock to insure its 9-8 victory. Co-captain Chip Bousom '91 was impressed with his team's over all performance in the match. ""Al though our offense wasn't as potent as last week, I thought that we played a much better all-around game. Our defense really shut down a powerful team, and except for the two long runs, we had the upper- hand throughout the day."" The All-Blacks were off over Spring Break, but will defend their unbeaten record at home in April. < T >> page 12 The Bucknellian April 5, 1991 i C.

Road map to Lord Stanley's Cup,"By Jon Terry Staff Writer April is now upon us, and to hockey fans across North America that means Stanley Cup playoffs. With no clearcut favorite this year, one can look forward to many ex citing games and some possible sur prises. Let's now break down each division: Patrick Division Washington Capitals vs. New York Rangers These two evenly-matched teams provide arguably the best first round matchup. The Rangers will be looking to avenge last year's second- round loss to the Caps when they saw John Druce singlehandcdly send them home. The Capitals come into the post season skating very well. Goaltender Don Beauprc was sec ond in the NHL in goals against av erage with a 2.64, and he led the league with five shutouts - including two consecutively the last week of the regular season. As for scoring, the Caps are led by defenseman Kevin Hatcher, who along with center Michal Pivonka make up a solid power play. Forwards Mike Ridley, Kelly Miller, Druce, Dino Ciccarelli, and defenseman A1 Iafrate all enter the playoffs playing solid, consistent hockey. As for the Rangers, they slumped in the last part of the season - losing their season-long first place throne to Pittsburgh. Goalie Mike Richter has had a fine year between the pipes, and is playing very well again after a slight slump. He even had a game this year where he made 59 saves. That game does not, how ever, truly reflect New York's usu ally solid defense. Brian Lcctch may be the best defenseman in the NHL this side of Ray Bourque. Mark Hardy had a great playoffs last year, holding down the Rangers' battered blue line. Oh yes, they have fire power up front, too. Center Bemie Nicholls, speester Mike Gartner, Darren Turcotte, and John Ogrodnick can fill the net in a hurry. EDGE: It's a tossup, but the Capitals' special teams will advance them to the second round. New Jersey Devils vs. Pittsburgh Penguins The talk of Pittsburgh right now is ""The Trade"". At first the deal that sent team scoring leader John Cullen and Zarlcy Zalapski to Hart ford for Ron Francis, Uif Samuclsson and Grant Jennings seemed questionable at best. But now that these three have led the Pens' spectacular charge to the top of the Patrick Division, General Manager Craig Patrick looks like a genius, for this season anyway. Needless to say the Penguins can score goals. Led by a healthy Mario"
Tennis--,"Lemieux (knock on wood Penguin fans) and the steady scoring of defenseman Paul Coffey and for wards Mark Recchi, Kevin Stevens, and rookie Jaromir Jagr, the Pens should be able to put points on the board. The Penguins will have some problems in the later round, how ever, as they just don't play the de fensive, tight-checking hockey as sociated with the Stanley Cup play offs. This face is countered by the fact that first-year Pens Joe Mullen and Brian Trottier both have playoff experience, and should be able to guide the younger players. Tom Barasso, despite having a streaky year, is a former Rookie of the Year and Vezina Trophy winner. The twenty-five year old, eight-year vet eran has looked solid lately. The Devils changed coaches in February, opting for Tom McVie over John Cuniff, but it doesn't re ally matter - they still aren't very good. John MacLean and Kirk Muller are solid up front, but center Brendan Shanahan regressed this year and Claude Lamieux has been inconsistent. Bruce Driver, Ken Daneyko, and the two Russians make up a good defense - the team's strength. Chris Terreri, who had a poor post-season last year, and the overrated Sean Burke are the goal ies. EDGE: Pittsburgh, easily. The Pens, unbeatable at home, have home ice advantage and way too much firepower. Besides, any team with a player named Laurie (Boschman) just can't win. Adams Division Hartford Whalers vs. Boston Bruins Sorry Whaler fans (do any ex ist anyway?), but this team is not very good. They come into the play offs 0-4-3 in their last seven games, and morale is low after the trade of two extremely popular players (Francis and Samuelsson). John Cullen can score, but he is small - Cam Neely should have fun with him. Veteran Kevin Dineen is an al most identical player to Cullen, only more fragile, and he is still bitter over the trade of Francis - his best friend. That about leaves it up to Pat Verbeek, their best player. The goalkeeping tandem of Kay Whitmore and Peter Sidorkiewicz is suspect at best. The Bruins, on the other hand, arc looking to repeat as Wales Con ference champions. Boston is led by the steady trio of Neely, Craig Janney, and Ray Bourque (their combined +/- is 67!). Look for new comer Ken Hodge to come on strong in the playoffs - he is very under rated. Add to that the fact that netminders Andy Moog and Reggie Lemelin have a history of awesome Aprils, and the Bruins look solid. EDGE: Boston in a cakewalk. Hartford plays well at home, so it probably won't be a sweep. Buffalo Sabres vs. Montreal Canadiens Watch out for Buffalo, folks, they could be a sleeper. Dale Howerchuk has come on strong af ter a slow start, and he appears fired up for the playoffs. Alexander Mogilny is the besj of the Soviets in the NHL, and is a potent scorer. Pierre Turgeon and Dave Andreychuk are also solid, two-way forwards. The defense, led by Mike Ramsey is also capable. The loss of Doug Bodger to a shoulder injury will hurt, but heavy hitters Dean Kennedy, Uwe Krupp, and Grant Ledyard can muscle with anybody. The Darren Puppa/Clint Malarchuk tandem had an off year, but have a reputable playoff history. Montreal has loads of poten tial, but they haven't been able to in still fear in their opponents like in the past. Their leading scorer this year was Russ Courtnall. Denis Savard came over from Chicago and turned in a fair year by his standards, but the Habs still wish they hadn't parted with Chris Chelios, who left a gap on the blue line that the youngsters could not fill. Of course, guys like Stephane Richer, Savard and goalie Patrick Roy can't be taken lightly, but this team just does not have enough guns. EDGE: Buffalo will win in seven. Norris Division Minnesota North Stars vs. Chicago Blackhawks The Blackhawks won the regular season NHL overall title with 106 points, and, yes, they are that good. Fiery coach Mike Keenan should have Chicago brimming with confidence going in. Steve Larmer and Jeremy Roenick have more than made up for Savard's scoring. Steve Thomas, Adam Creighton, Michel Goulet, and former playoff hero Wayne Presley are key men on an excellent front fine. Defenseman Doug Wilson's speed and rocket shot give the Blackhawks an awe some power play, and fellow blue liners Chelios, Dave Manson, and Trent Yawney provide a tough de fense. On top of all that, Chicago has the best goalie in the league in rookie Ed Belfour, who led the NHL in wins and goals against average. Minnesota got off to an awful start this year, but later turned it around somewhat, despite playing in front of lousy home crowds. The North Stars got outstanding work this year from goalie Jon Casey. Dave Gagner, Brian Bellows, Brian Propp, and Neal Broten provide the scoring. Bobby Smith and Ulf Dahien have lots of experience which is nice to have in the playoffs, but Minnesota has a woeful lack of scoring depth. EDGE: Chicago will advance in five. The most exciting battle in this series could be a Shane Churla - Mike Peluso fight. These two hate each other! Detroit Red Wings vs. St. Louis Blues St. Louis was the second best regular season team (105 pts.), and we all know who their leader is. In case you missed it, Brett Hull scored 86 goals this year, third highest in NHL history. Hull's linemate Adam Oates is the best passer this side of Wayne Gretzky, and Jeff Brown, newcomer Dan Quinn, and Rod Brind'Amour can all score also. Former Capital Scott Stevens an chors the defense, along with red-hot goalie Vincent Riendeau, who was unbeaten in his last six starts, al lowing only nine goals. Detroit has some pop in their lineup as well, led by 104-point man Steve Yzerman. Sergei Fedorov, Jimmy Carson, and Kevin Miller complement Yzerman well. The Wings do have some very experi enced players, the problem is that they aren't very good. Brad McCrimmon was dumped by Calgary and Doug Crossman came from the Islanders to post a team- worst -18. The Red Wings main problem is goaltending. Tim Cheveldae is the starter coming off a poor year, so look for Glen Hanlon, who has had previous playoff suc cess, to get some time. EDGE: S t Louis in five. Smvthe Division Vancouver Canucks vs. Los Angeles Kings The Kings, led by Number 99, are coming off a division title and look ready to unseat Calgary and Edmonton as Smythe powerhouse. Wayne Gretzky won his tenth scor ing title in the past twelve years, and he appears ready to bring the Stanley Cup to southern California. Thomas Sanstrom, Luc Robitaille, and Tony Granato lead the offense along with the Great One. While the Smythe Division is not known for defense, the Kings boast a decent one. Rookie Rob Blake had a good year, and along with future Hall of Famer Larry Robinson and tough-guy Marty McSorley (+41) make up a sufficient blue line. Goalie Kelly Hrudy had a great year and is always tough in April. Daniel Berthiaume is a very capable backup. Vancouver slipped past Winnepeg for the last playoff spot From page 14 6-1 at number one doubles. Barbera and Cantor folded 6-1,6-2 at number two, and Bank, who dropped his number five singles match 6-4,6-3, and Rimpel lost a tougher match at number three doubles, fighting to a 6-7 (11-9), 6-0,7-6 (7-4) loss. The Bison's woes continued against Florida Atlantic University in their final match of the trip, on Friday the 29th. Playing with a slightly revised lineup, Bucknell nonetheless dropped the top four singles matches, with only StenstrOm taking his number four effort to a third set, losing 6-4, 2-6, 6-3. Barbera played number two and Cantor three as Charlier remained at the top spot. At number five, Bank was victorious 7-5, 6-3, while Rimpel took three sets to defeat his number six opponent 6-2,3-6,6-1. Bucknell's cause for celebra tion on the day was a number one doubles victory for the familiar Charlier-Stenstrttm duo over the top Florida Atlantic matchup of Robb Gould and Shawn Olson, who forced a second set tie-breaker before fall ing 6-4, 7-6 (9-7). Barbera and Cantor dropped 6-2, 6-4, and Bank and Rimpel were beaten 6-2,6-3 to close the team's spring break matches on a somewhat disappoint ing note. Spirits were raised briefly upon the team's return to Lewisburg, as they defeated Towson State 6-3 at home on Tuesday. Victories at both the top two singles and the top two doubles positions helped Bucknell defeat their ex-ECC rivals. Charlier proved himself as Bucknell's top singles player with a three set victory over Towson's Kevin Scott, 4-6,6-3,6-3. Barbera also turned in a solid three set vic tory, beating Brian Yang 6-2,3-6,6- 1 at the number two spot. Other singles victories came from Cantor at number four, 6-2, 6-2, and Bank at number five, 6-1,6-2. Doubles victories were turned in by number one Charlier and Saturday, April 6 Men's Lax vs. Holy Cross Men's Tennis vs. Lehigh Women's Lax vs. Lafayette Sunday, April 7 . Bucknell Track Invitational Tuesday, April 9 Golf vs. Lafayette, Rider, Swarthmore Thursday, April 11 Softball vs. Penn State Women's Lax vs. Georgetown Stenstrdm, 6-4,6-0, and number two Barbera and Cantor, 6-1, 6-4. Buckncll's only three losses on the day were by Bank and Rimpel at number three doubles, Rimpel at number six singles, and StenstrOm, who fell in a tough three set number three singles match in which he took the first set in an 8-6 tiebreaker only to lose the remaining sets 6-4,6-3. More losses were incurred by the Bison as they travelled to Bloomsburg yesterday to take on a primed Huskie team which was ranked sixth in the NCAA's most recent Divison II poll. Bucknell's only victory in the 6-1 defeat came from Charlier and Stenstrdm, who denied Bioomsburg's Kyle Barton and Brian Billone at number one doubles, 7-5,6-4. The other doubles matches were both heartbreakers, in which the duos of Barbera and Cantor and Bank and Rimpel lost in third set tiebreakers. All six singles matches were lost in straight sets, most nota bly with Charlier losing 6-0, 6-3 to All-American Roly Lamy at number one, a match with which Lamy tied his school's all-time victory record, bringing his overall record to 119- 41. All in all it has been a busy two weeks for the Bison men, who bring their record to a solid 3-4. When asked about the future of the squad, StenstrOm replied, ""The team will come together soon. We're still very young and relatively inexperienced, so as the season progresses and we get more match experience under our belts, our record should defi nitely improve."" Other team members are also hopeful about the remainder of the season and see the team as talented and full of potential. With the addi tion of all the young talent to the team's already deep roster of sea soned players, Charlier and Cantor now agree that, ""Not only are we one of the strongest teams in the league, but also the best looking."""

Wouldn't it be great to see a Kelly Hrudey - Bob Mason matchup in a reunion of sorts of the four overtime game between the Caps and Islanders a few years ago? Edmonton Oilers vs. Calgary Flames This should be a great matchup of the past two Stanley Cup winners. Calgary is led by Theo Fleury, A1 Maclnnis, Joe Nieuwendyk, Doug Gilmour, and Sergei Makarov in the scoring de partment. Gary Suter, Jamie Macoun, and Ric Nattress trigger the defense. Goalie Mike Vernon is one of the best in the business - capable of taking a team all the way. Rick Wamsley could be the best backup netminder in the league. Calgary is motivated by their embarrassing first-round loss to L.A. last year, and first year coach Doug Risebrogh is a good one. Edmonton, the reigning champ, had a miserable year. Their .500 finish can be partially blamed on Mark Messier's injuries, but not fully. The unidimentional Petr Klima is the leading scorer, but Esa Tikkanen can play both ways. Not only is he one of the team's leading scorers, but he was responsible for shutting down Gretzky in the second round last year. Edmonton will be relying heavily on the Kid Lien - Adam Graves, 22, Joe Murphy, 22, and Martin Gelinas, 20 - to repeat last year's successful playoffs.

Bison victorious in five of last seven,
Yesterday's tie against St. Bonaventure and Tuesday's 8-6 win over William Patterson push record to 10-4-1,"By Jon Terry Staff Writer While the rest of the campus was off in sunny lands unknown during Spring Break, the Bucknell baseball team remained in ""the bubble"" for the bulk of its 12-game homestand. On March 21, Bucknell hosted Lock Haven. The Bison erased a 5-3 Lock Haven lead with a three-run sixth inning which was capped off by a Ted Obligato '91 double, plat ing the tying and go-ahead runs. Denis Maguire '93 pitched two scoreless innings in relief of Mike Rizzi '93 (2-0) for his second"

He fanned the next two hitters and retired the third on a groundout to third. Steve Gyimesi '93 led the of fense, going 2 for 3 with three RBI's. Mike Kearns '93 had two hits and scored three runs, and SUNY- Binghampton helped out with four errors of its own. Game two was never in any doubt as Bucknell jumped out to a 6- 0 lead after four innings. Obligato This game marked the mound return of Kurt Waldner '93, last year's ace who had been out of ac tion with arm problems. Waldner started and pitched three innings, giving up one unearned run on four hits, striking out two. Rick Heller '94 (three no-hit innings) and Jim Stevens '94 (3 EP, 1 run, 3 hits, 4 K's) each pitched well in relief. The next day, LeMoyne played here and ended the Bison's four game winning streak. LeMoyne showed off its lumber in this one, pounding out a 12-10 win. Pitchers Rizzi and Maguire were rocked for 12 runs on 15 hits. Neither of them could figure out LeMoyne rightfielder Chuck Kulle, who had a five hit afternoon, including a double and a triple. Ed Gay homered in the fourth for the visitors, triggering a 10-run onslaught in the middle innings. Shoddy defense by Bucknell also hurt. Three errors resulted in three unearned runs, the difference in the game. The Bison wasted a solid of fensive effort in this contest, getting 16 hits in the game (six for extra bases), with six players getting at least two. Rinker homered and doubled, and Koemer had three hits to lead the attack. Kearns, Obligato, Ahrens, and Larry Trout '93 also had two hits apiece. Rinker was named Patriot League Player of the Week. He went 5 for 10 with his first home run of the year, four RBI's, and four runs scored. This past Tuesday, Bucknell hosted William Paterson College. The Bison got out to a 6-2 lead, and held on for an 8-6 victory. After Mark Kennedy's RBI single in the first inning and Rinker's RBI groundout in the second, Bucknell exploded for four in the third. In the inning Obligato and Ahrens singled to start it off. Back- to-back doubles by Kennedy and Gyimesi brought runs in, and two groundouts later, Gyimesi scored the fourth run of the inning. Kennedy finished the day go ing 3 for 4 with three RBI and two runs scored. Koemer singled and triple in four at bats, and Snicgocki also had two hits. Meanwhile, Koemer is estab lishing himself as one of the best relief pitchers in the league. He pitched the final 1 1/3 innings in this game for his third save of the year.

Bucknell scored single runs in each of the first two innings, but then saw Lock Haven record four unearned runs in the third with a walk, an error, and five singles. Mark Kennedy '92 of the Bi son doubled in a run in the fifth to make it 4-3, but Lock Haven retali ated with one of its own in the top of the sixth. Its lead disappeared in the bottom of the frame on Obligato's clutch stroke. SUNY-Binghampton was the next opponent to visit Lewisburg, on March 25, and the players probably wished they had stayed in New York.

Women's lacrosse starts,"By Eliza Wampler With six games under their belt, the Women's Lacrosse team has begun their season only 1-5, yet they have shown signs of strong play and improved levels of skill and confidence. The opponents that the stick gals have faced thus far have been strong and competitive, pre paring the team for an jntense sched ule ahead. The Women dropped their fifth game yesterday at home to Towson State. The game began competitively as the teams were deadlocked at five early in the sec ond half. But the Bison just crumpled as Tigers scored the next seven goals before defeating Buck nell 19-6. Julie Goeller '91 led the way with a couple of goals while Dorie Lynn Ellwood '92, Kristina Haas '91, Jen Kehoe '94, and Lynn Santilli '91 each scored once. Leslie Why '91 played in her first game since injuring her ankle in the season opener and responded with an assist. The lacrosse ladies opened their season March 17th with a tough defeat by fierce competitor, Loyola, 17-4. The first half rattled the Lady Bison, as Loyola dominated. During the second half, however, the Buck nell attack became more successful with more shots on goal and the de fense was able to hold Loyola's of fensive force. Scoring for Bucknell were Ellwood, Sue Wells '93, Trisha Way '94 and Kehoe. Shippensburg was the next competitor that the Lady Bison battled, but they were defeated 12- 11 in a strong and exciting game. Head Coach Jennifer Averill com mented, ""That is the type of game I love to see. My players remained strong the entire game, keeping Shippensburg in complete control."" Single goals were scored by Wells, Goeller and Santilli. Kehoe added three goals while Ellwood had five goals in the loss. Thus far, the highlight of the ladies' season was the game against Patriot League rival Holy Cross. The Bisons took control of the game im mediately, showing great skill and aggression winning 14-2. Kehoe, Way, Goeller, Haas, Allison Arth '93, Jill Schuyler '93, and Sarah Walker '94 each contributed one goal for the Bison. Sue Signori '93 and Wells each contributed two, while Ellwood fired in three. ""It was nice to get a victory in so early in the season. It has given the team the confidence they need to be success ful in the future,"" Averill com mented. The team has just returned"

Peter Ho/The Bucknellian Outfielder Steve Gyimesi '93 legs out an infield single during last Tuesday's 8-6 defeat of William Patterson at home. Gyimesi, who has been hampered by a pulled hamstring muscle, carried a five-game hitting streak into yesterday's game at St. Bonaventure. loaded and the .405-hitting Keith Eaddy up for William Patterson, Koemer got the slugger to fly out to center, then threw a scoreless ninth to close out the win. In his four appearences this year, Koemer has yet to give up a run in seven innings, and he has allowed only one hit all year. Jack Kazanjian (3-1) started for the Bison, and Maguire, Waldner, Ahrens, and Koemer all pitched in relief. The leading hitters for the Bi son entering the William Patterson game were Kearns (.357), Rinker (.344), Jim Zervanos '92 (.344), Trout (.326), Gyimesi (.320), and Ahrens (.302). Ahrens also leads the team with three home runs and 14 RBI. Kearns and Trout lead the team with 15 hits, and Kearns has a team- high 17 runs scored. As for the pitchers, Koemer had an impressive 0.00 ERA to lead the staff into yesterday's game at St. Bonaventure. Stevens (1.59), Rizzi (4.50), and Krewson (5.63) follow. Kazanjian now leads the team with three wins. Yesterday, Bucknell and St."
slowly,"from a spring trip to Virginia, where they met Old Dominion University and the University of Richmond. They were defeated by both, 15-7 and 11-6, respectively, but still played well during the Richmond game. Goalie Kahra Foster '92 was exceptional in the net, making 18 saves against Richmond. Averill's outlook on the sea son is a very positive one, as she feels that the team this year shows a great amount of depth, strength, and a positive morale. ""The team is combining very well. I have a very strong freshman class, and many experienced returning players."" Her expectations are very high for her players, as she sees enormous amounts of potential in each one. Ellwood has been the core of lead ership on the offensive end, as she has scored 11 goals and added seven assists, displaying what Averill de scribed as ""aggressive, finessed, and very agile play."" Kehoe has also been dangerous as she has scored ten goals to go along with four assists. At midfield, there is an enormous amount of speed, which is a huge asset to the team. Arth, Way, and Signori are dominant in this area. Why and Haas help with the unity and leadership on the field, as they both possess an enormous amount of skill and poise. Tomorrow, the lady lacrosse players will be facing Patriot League rival Lafayette at home in an attempt to stretch their record to 2-0 in the conference. Bonaventure played to an 11-inning 5-5 tie in Odcan. The game was called prior to the 12th because of darkness. The Bison led 4-3 with two out in the bottom of the ninth, but Jon Phillips hit an opposite field home run for the Bonies off Koemer, who had come on in the eighth in re lief. It was the first run he had al lowed this year In the 11th, the Bison took a 5-4 lead as Brian Walter '94 singled, went to second on a sacrifice by Rinker and scored on Koerner's triple. Bucknell could have scored more, but Ahrens' shot to the wall was snagged Willie Mays-style by John Boccieri. St. Bonaventure tied the score up in the home half of the inning, Don Farrance walked, moved to second on a sacrifice, went to third on a single, and scored on a Phillip's sacrifice fly. Bucknell's record now stands at 10-4-1. The Bison open up Patriot League play with a doublcheader at Holy Cross, followed by a single game there on Sunday. Holy Cross is led by Coach Jack Whalen, who returns seven starters and the entire pitching staff from last year's 17-13 club. ^ ""Around the Horn"" ^ Andy Nezelek '87, a pitcher in the Atlanta Braves farm system, un derwent shoulder surgery and may miss the entire 1991 season for the AAA Richmond Braves...

Tennis returns home after,
splitting its four matches,"By Mike Markovich The men's tennis team re turned to Bucknell Sunday after its annual spring break trip to Florida during which it went 2-2 against some very diverse and competitive schools. The Bison made quick work of their first two opponents of the week, Aurora University of Illinois on Saturday the 23rd and Florida's Barry University the following day. The Aurora squad proved to be no match for the deep Bison team, who shut them out in nine straight set matches in which the only Aurora opponent to win more than one game was their number-two doubles brother combination of Dave and JeffBongiouno. Their match against Bucknell's number-two duo, An drew Cantor '92 and and Greg Downing '94, ended in a 6-1, 6-2 score. At number-three doubles, Scott Bank '91 and Chris Rimpel '93, were relentless in a 6-0, 6-0 thrashing of Aurora's Jared Bebar and Ed Zabelin. Jerome Charlier '92 and Cris Stcnstrom '94 disposed of Mike Walton and Jeff Thomas 6-0, 6-1 at the number-one spot. In singles action, three of the six matches ended in 6-0,6-0 scores, with Cantor, Rimpel, and Downing downing their foes at numbers three, five, and six, respectively. Charlier, continuing at number one singles, and Bank, at number four, won by 6- 0, 6-1 margins. StenstrOm was vic torious at number two, 6-1,6-0. The team from Barry Univer sity posed little more of a challenge for the Bison on Sunday. No match went into a third set, and the final score of 6-2 reflected singles losses by Charlier and Bruno Barbera '94, at the number one and three spots, respectively. Charlier lost both his sets by tough 7-6 scores to Barry's Todd Rubenstein, while Barbera put up less of a fight during his 6-4,6-3 match. Bucknell chalked up victo ries in the remaining singles matches, with StenstrOm winning 6- 4, 6-3, while Cantor, Bank, and Rimpel again demonstrated the team's depth with decisive victories at the four, five, and six spots, losing only six games between them. The number-one doubles match was cancelled due to the length of Charlicr's singles match, denying Barry the opportunity to avoid a Bucknell doubles sweep as Barbera and Cantor won 7-6,6-3 at number two. Bank and Downing followed suit at number three, easily winning 6-1, 6-1 to complete the second of Buckncll's victories on the trip. From there, the trip took a turn for the worse, as the Bison moved north from the Miami setting of the first two matches to Boca Raton for the final two. There they met up with two tough teams, Florida At lantic and the local College of Boca Raton. Both matches ended in 6-3 defeats. The only bright spots for the Bison on Wednesday the 27th, the date of their battle with the College of Boca Raton, were singles victo ries for Barbera at number three, Cantor at four, and a default victory for Rimpel at number six. Barbera took his match 6-4,7-6 (7-3), Cantor 7-6 (8-6), 6-3. Charlier and StenstrOm each went down 6-0,6-1 in their singles matches and lost 6-2, See TENNIS, page 13"

Jeans Day sparks controversy,
First Am endm ent rights surround issue,"By Andrew Cohen Staff Writer Jeans Day, originally sched uled to be a day of support for the rights of homosexuals and bi sexuals, has become entangled in controversy by the establishment of the first annual Bucknell ""Hetero sexual Pride Day."" Evan Maloney '94, head of the Ad Hoc Committee for Heterosexual Awareness, explained that he estab lished the day because he ""always wanted a vehicle to expose how the left-wing groups work on campus. We figured that Jeans Day would be a vehicle to expose their tactics."" According to Maloney, ""We have fifty people pledged to wear ties and skirts (respectively)."" The group posted fliers around campus which Maloney says ""someone took... and added the tag line FAG (Friends of anti-gays)... Then the people from POWER (Partnership of Women Engaged in Revolution) tore down our signs, so we printed more, and they were tom down again."" After this, Maloney and other members of the ad hoc committee ""did a chalk talk, and POWER defaced that which we thought was pretty hypocritical be cause these were the same groups al legedly fighting for the right to be heard."" A representative of POWER described incidents differently. The representative denied knowledge of tearing down posters, but did say"
Bio building construction,
"on schedule, under budget","By David Murray Staff Writer After four months of planning and nearly a year of construction, both the new biology building, and the atrium connecting it to the chem istry building, are nearing comple tion. The project is ""within schedule, and we expect it will come in under budget,"" according to Barry Max well, vice president for administra tion. ""If things continue to go as planned, and that's a big if, we should be in the building for the fall semester,"" said Jack Harclerode, professor of biology and head of the building's design committee. In the event problems do occur, ""classes will start in Taylor and the move ment of the biology department will occur during the semester at a schedule set by the department,"" Maxwell said. The $12 million, 65,000 square foot biology building is part of the second phase of a three-phase plan to create a state-of-the-art sci ence complex. Phase one involved Allie Zadroga/The Bucknellian The construction of a $12 million biology building is approaching completion ahead of schedule and under budget. The building is the second part of a three-phase plan to create a state-of-the art science complex."
Faculty opposes incinerator,"the nearby Lycoming County land fill may attract other waste proces sors. Finally, he addressed the ques tion ""Do we need it somewhere?"" by asserting that ""building the incin erator provides a cheap alternative, and creates a disincentive"" for recy cling and waste reduction programs. Larry Shinn, vice president for academic affairs, addressed the concerns surrounding the transport of the hazardous waste, asking, ""even if one accepts the premise"" that the technology is safe ""how does By Bob Ritter Staff Writer The Bucknell faculty voted unanimously to approve a motion opposing the proposed Gregg Township hazardous waste incin erator. By passing the motion pro posed by Jeffrey Evans, associate professor of civil engineering, the faculty joins over 130 local govern ment organizations, corporations and other groups who have voiced their opposition to the project. In explaining his motion, which stated that ""the Bucknell fac ulty goes on record against the siting of a hazardous waste incinerator in Gregg Township,"" Evans delineated several negative effects of the incin erator, among them its effect on Bucknell's ability to attract students. Noting that many students come to Bucknell from urban areas because of the area's beauty, he said the in cinerator ""could have a direct impact on us."" Evans also pointed out the danger that ""the presence of the in cinerator could bring the area to be an epicenter of dirty industry,"" since the presence of the incinerator and that her group went out last Sunday to do their own chalk-writing when they saw the writings from the ad hoc committee of heterosexual awareness. The representative ex plained that they felt they had to ""re spond to the hate that they are per petuating or trying to create."" Ad ditionally, she noted that the events were ""effective, because it was actu ally a dialogue."" Maloney asserted that ""we exposed them for what they were. They are not for free speech, they are for their speech, 'politically correct' speech."" He explained that since the first two attempts at publicizing Heterosexual Awareness Day were unsuccessful, he resorted to printing an announcement in ""What's Hap pening."" The announcement was taken to Mary Dorsey, acting associate dean of student life, who explained that ""there was never any doubt that we would print it because it did not See JEANS DAY, page 2"
Faculty debates PELL grants,"the construction of the chemistry building and the renovation of the Olin science building, and phase two will conclude with the renovation of Taylor Hall and the botany building. Construction is progressing extremely smoothly, and both Max well and Harclerode credit the ""good working team of owner, architect, and contractor"" with that success. The architect of the biology building also designed the chemistry building and the renovations of Olin Science, See BIO BUILDING, page 6 By Travis Elliott Staff Writer On Monday, the Bucknell fac ulty reconsidered its earlier decision to counteract a federal drug policy which denies PELL grants to college students convicted of drug viola tions. Dean Baker, assistant profes sor of economics and author of the original motion, claimed that the federal government's policy dis criminates against lower-income students, who qualify for the grants. The issue came to the floor when Charles Longley, professor of political science, introduced a re consideration of Baker's motion which was passed by the faculty in February. Baker contends that the federal policy is discriminatory be cause it requires only students re ceiving PELL grants, a form of fed eral tuition assistance, to sign a pledge affirming that they will not use illegal drugs. He argued that lower-income students, who may not be able to attend Bucknell without the aid, are forced to accept an ad ditional requirement that other stu dents are not. Losing this assistance could force disadvantaged students to leave Bucknell, while other stu dents could remain after a similar drug offense. In addition, the federal See PELL GRANTS, page 5 Bucknellian File Photo President Gary Sojka, pictured at the Apr. 1 faculty meeting, fears that implementing a PELL grant motion could affect financial aid."
TIP approaches final stages,"See INCINERATOR, page 5 By Julie Shurilla Staff Writer TIP, the Trustee Implementa tion Program, which began almost a year ago, is nearing its final stages. By the end of this semester, Presi dent Gary Sojka is expected to an nounce the final recommendations by the TIP committees for imple menting changes in social and resi dential life at Bucknell. Charlotte Weddle, associate vice president for student life, de scribed the recommendations as ""a Bucknell plan for a better Bucknell."" Although many students may see the plan as being exclusively aimed at the Greek system, Weddle says it is ""more holistic than Greek issues"" and is meant to cover all areas of social and residential life. When asked how significant the impact of TIP will be on the Bucknell community, Dave Skena '92, co-chair of the steering com mittee for TIP, said that ""changes will be substantial, but once people get used to them, they will be toler able."" He also said that there should be ""no surprises"" when the president makes his final announcement. However, he is afraid that some changes may be delayed because of budget constraints. The history of TIP is a long and complex one. It began last spring when the trustees gave Presi dent Sojka a list of recommendations for restructuring the social/residen- tial community at Bucknell. These changes were to be made in five ar eas, including the Greek system, residential and social life, the fresh man year experience, and a four-year residency requirement. Weddle and Skena, then- president of Bucknell Student Gov ernment, recommended to President Sojka that task teams be formed to deal with each of the five areas. Toward this end, an open meeting took place last fall, where members of the Bucknell community, includ ing students, faculty, administrators, and alumni, were invited to attend and become members the task teams. TIP guidelines were drawn up, committees were formed, and chair persons for each committee were chosen, all of whom are students. The committee chairs along with Weddle and Skena formed the steering committee for the entire TIP project, the main function of which, See TIP, page 6 Ashley Cherlkof/The Bucknellian Final recommendations of TIP, chaired by Charlotte Weddle and Dave Skena '92, will be announced by the end of the semester."

Jeans Day,"From page 1 contain anything offensive in the ' fighting words' mode."" Dorsey added, "" Any person has a right to publish... in What's Happening. I would have published a message from FAG; we're not in the business o f censoring."" Dorsey did contend however, that, "" we are in the business o f sen sitizing. I find the whole thing that is happening in the way of intoler ance on college campuses very up setting. We continue to try to help students and others understand the importance of accepting others and diversity... because a lot of people come upon their first experince of racism, sexism, or homophobia in college."" Dorsey's only regret about the Heterosexual Pride Day is that, "" I wish they were not on the same day because there's room for both view points."" M olly Swart '92, a trained peer educator for homophobia, re sponded to the Heterosexual Pride Day saying, "" It's obvious why they're having this day on Jeans Day. It scares me that these indi viduals feel threatened by Jeans Day. This day is not to attack or threaten heterosexuality."" Swart continued by explaining that "" this week is probably the best example o f the [widespread problem o f hom o phobia]. It's pretty well-known that there is not a safe environment for homosexuals on the campus, or even for people involved in things like F L A G ."" Swart conceded that part of this problem arises from ignorance as to what it means to wear jeans next Wednesday. ""There arc mis- conceptions on what the support is for; it's for people of different sexual orientations that deserve rights. So when people wear jeans, they're not necessarily supporting homosexual ity and bi-sexuality; they are sup porting people who deserve the same rights as heterosexuals."" The meaning of Jeans Day has caused confusion within the Chris tian community. Dick Wiedenheft '92, an executive committee mem ber of Intervarsity Christian Fellow ship, said, "" I don't think it's clear to everyone what it means to wear jeans."" Wiedenheft who wanted it made clear that he does not "" repre- i sent anyone other than myself and hopefully God,"" predicted that a ; representative segment o f I Intervarsity would "" wear jeans and a ' Christian tee-shirt."" Wiedenheft explained that his dilemma revolves around ""Loving the sinner but hating the sin. That pretty much sums it up... The Bible makes it clear that whatever the ori entation, homosexual acts are wrong, that it is detestable for a man to lie with a man like he would lie with a woman."" On the other hand, Wiedenheft thinks, "" You can do it if you want to, you have the freedom to do it, but I think it is wrong."" In addition to the issue of het erosexual pride, Maloney thinks that free speech has become a more im portant issue in the context of Jeans Day. "" W e're not against homo sexuals, but we arc for heterosexu als. It's more an issue of speech than of sexual preference... By not using our voice, we allow these fascist notions such as 'politically correct speech' to gain power... I think that one of the scariest things is this 'po litically correct' movement; it is the"

Nursing service,
time decreased,"By Bob Minnich Staff Writer Responding to the changing nature of university health care and to the declining number of evening visits by students, the Student Medical Service will no longer provide 24-hour nursing coverage. Instead, nurses will be available weekdays from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. The schedule changes will take effect beginning next semes ter. Characterizing the changes in health care, Dr. J . Preston Hoyle, director of Student Medi cal Services, said that ""over the past ten years we've become more proactive."" Outreach programs and preventative measures are now more a part of the medical service's goals. Freshman hall talks on sexually transmitted dis eases, AIDS educators, drug and alcohol peer educators, and bro chures covering health and dietary habits attempt to make the Buck- nell community safer and healthier. As part of proactive medi cine, Hoyle said ""we would love to have a health educator"" to co ordinate and expand programs. Accoj iing to a survey of 16 other universities done by Student M edical Services, 13 o f the schools had such an office within their medical care facilities. Since funding for a similar position is unlikely at Bucknell, Hoyle stated that the scheduling change for the nursing staff will "" free one of the nurses who has an interest in health education."" The new position of Health Care/Staff Nurse will cover both nursing and health care programs without an overall increase in the person's working hours. The medical services staff now conducts educational pro grams on their own time after working hours. According to Hoyle, the part-time health educator "" will improve the programs we already have in place and will be able to set up new programs,"" as well as coordinate preventative instruc tion. Another reason for the change in staffing hours is the increased use of the emergency room at Evangeli cal Community Hospital. Despite efforts to inform students that medi cal care is available 24 hours fronr the medical service, students use the hospital' s emergency room foi health problems not limited solely tc emergencies. As a result, Studem Medical Services has averaged one student visit every two nights ovei the last several years. Hoyle at tributes this to students being un aware that a nurse is on duty throughout the night and because some students wish to see a doctoi rather than a nurse. Hoyle also stated that in ordei to cover the necessary hours nurse: work split shifts totalling 46 hour: per week. Medical services is ""fac ing the issue of hiring new nurse: over the next several years,"" anc with a national nursing shortage th< present schedule places Bucknell ai a competitive disadvantage in at tracting new nurses. The proposed change in stafl hours and safety was discussed wit) the offices of Student Life, Residen tial Life and Security, as well as the Student Medical Services advisory board. The board is composed pri marily of students. Finally, the pro posed change was submitted tc President Gary Sojka through Stu dent Life. Under the current schedule nursing care is provided daily froir 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. with a nurse or duty from 10 p.m. to 8 a.m. foi emergencies. Nursing coverage i: provided by four general duty nurse: and one head nurse/administrativ< assistant. During the day, two oi three nurses are on duty, while one nurse remains at medical service: between 6 p.m. and 8 a.m. Hoyl added that the present schedule worked until Student Medical Ser vices began to focus on more proactive medicine. Beginning in September, students with emergencies after hours will be referred to Evangeli cal Hospital's emergency room. A Bucknell doctor will remain on- call with the emergency room doctor as is necessary."
Free AIDS testing,
two days,
extended,"By Bob Minnich Staff Writer Response to the free and anonymous AIDS testing offered at Stu dent Medical Services has been "" somewhat overwhelming"" according to Dr. J. Preston Hoyle, director of Student Medical Services. Blood tests will be offered April 18 and April 25. Originally, only one testing date, April 9, was offered. Hoyle attributes the overwhelming campus interest to the personal questionnaire sponsored by the AID S task force, Friends of Lesbians and Gays (FLAG), and the medical center. "" You cannot throw condoms at the AIDS problem,"" added Hoyle. Awareness through peer educators and other outreach programs needs to be part of the solution. Testing is part of that awareness. For more information or to make an appointment for an AID S test contact Student Medical Services."

University departments,
undergo major budget cuts,"B y Tara Gilligan Staff Writer A  soaring increase in the cost o f subscriptions forced Ann de Klerk, director of library services, to announce at M onday' s faculty meeting the need for academic de partments to cut back their requests for subscriptions for next year. With only a nine percent increase in its operating budget, part of a series of budgetary limitations set upon the University, the library will have to reduce its number of subscriptions to account for a 15 percent rise in rates. The library's cuts are part of a much wider attempt to lim it the budget In November, the Board of Trustees opted for a 4.5 percent in crease in the comprehensive fee for students as opposed to the 6.7 per cent increase recommended by the finance and planning committee. "" The library has to try to hold the line just like any other depart ment, so they look at their entire budget and make decisions as to what they can cut,"" said Barry Maxwell, vice president of adminis tration. Several faculty members voiced concern at the faculty meet ing, claiming the library's decision to cut periodicals would hurt their programs. But, according to Michael Moohr, chairman of the faculty fi nance and planning committee, ""A good portion of the faculty thought it wasn't an altogether bad idea, that it really forced us to go through each departmental program and re-exam ine carefully our list of journals to see the ones we really could do without."" The library reductions are the most recent of the cuts made across campus. "" The trustees, because of the existence of the recession, be came convinced that Bucknell had to minimize its comprehensive fee in crease, and to get the increase down to the level they wanted we had to cut real expenditures,"" explained Moohr. Moohr explained that fears of the national recession's effects on the University prompted trustees to approve the 4.5 percent increase. ""They felt that given the recession, given the possibility that because of mass lay-offs, many potential stu dents could no longer afford to come here,"" he said. ranking in major projects in the order of their importance. Although the renovation of Trax, and several other residence halls, appear high on the capital projects priority list, M ax well said, "" It was decided that we would not pursue any of those items in that top list this coming year. Next year, next fall, we w ill decide whether we will continue to fund some of those projects. But no, we're not going to do it this year given that concern about financing, national economy, and budgetary concerns."""
"""The trustees, because of the existence",
"of the recession, became convinced",
that Bucknell had to minimize its com,
"prehensive fee, and to get the increase",
down to the level they wanted we had,
"to cut real expenditures.""",
"--Michael Moohr, finance and planning",
com m ittee chairman,"Because 80 percent o f the University's funds come from the comprehensive fee, an increase of only 4.5 percent made it necessary for the President's Council to deter mine what cuts and budgetary limi tations could be made for the 1991- 92 school year. "" Institutionally we're not making cuts. W e're not cutting back on any particular class of expansion,"" Maxwell said. But the President's Council did determine the need to limit the amount of money spent both within different areas of operation and in capital allocations. The University will delay renovations to residence halls which had been tentatively scheduled to begin this summer. Each year the Council devel ops a capital projects priority list, In addition, limitations will include a reduced increase in all de partments' operating budgets. On average, each department will be allowed an increase in its operating budget of no more than two percent, rather than a "" conventional, cus tomary 4.5 or five percent"" increase, said Maxwell. Because of an inflation rate of 4.5 percent, an increase of two per cent will result in real reductions for departmental operations. "" Every area of the University is affected-- psych services, student health, ath letics, academic departments, the administration, the residence life,"" said Moohr. ""Assuming the rate of inflation is 4.5 percent, all of us will experience a 2.5 percent reduction in the amount of resources we have to"
Radon concentration levels,
no longer dangerously high,"By David Murray Staff Writer Radon, a radioactive, carcino genic gas, is no longer found in dangerous levels anywhere on cam pus. Jim McCormick, safety man ager, has directed a $5,000 effort over three years to locate and re move all radon hazards. According to "" A  Citizen' s Guide to Radon,"" a pamphlet dis tributed by several federal agencies, ""Radon is a gas which can move through small spaces in the soil and rock on which a house is built. Ra don can seep into a home through dirt floors, cracks in concrete floors and w alls, floor drains, sumps, joints, and tiny cracks or pores in hollow-block walls."" The O ffice of Security and Safety began a campus radon testing program in 1988, headed by McCormick. ""Our goal,"" he said, "" was to test the residence halls for the presence of radon gas."" Since radon is created under ground, basement areas are most susceptible to contamination. Thus, he said, "" we followed and exceeded the Environm ental Protection Agency's [EPA] guidelines for ra don testing by testing the lowest level of every building, where the gas is most dense."" EPA guidelines only require testing of the lowest occupied level of a building. Concentrations of radon gas are reported as a number o f ""picocuries per liter"" (pCi/1) be tween 0 and 200. A  reading of 4 pCi/ 1 is considered the E P A 's 'action level' and may be dangerous. Readings at or below 4 pCi/1 are not harmful and generally cannot be corrected. Follow ing M cCorm ick' s original testing, only five residence halls were found to have radon con centrations above 4 pCi/1. Those halls are Harris, Roser, Kalm an- Posner, Swartz D-wing basement, and the East basement of Roberts Hall. The highest level o f radon contamination found was 9 pCi/1. "" After confirming those read ings, following EPA guidelines, we started remedial work in those ar eas,"" McCormick said. Such work was begun in November 1990. The radon leaking into Harris, Roser, and Kalman-Posner Halls was stopped when cracks in the floor and around the foundation were caulked and sealed. Radon seepage was also stopped in the Swartz D- wing basement when the mechanical air handling system was correctly balanced. The return air ducts had been pulling radon out of the ground and blowing it into the room. The source of radon in the East basement of Roberts Hall was harder to pinpoint. Eventually, however, ""We found, with extensive testing by environmental consultants, that the entrance of radon gas was through a pipe chase in the ground under the East wing basement"" according to McCormick. The problem was corrected when ""we sealed off the end of the chase and installed a mechanical air system that draws radon gas out of the pipe chase and dispels it out side."" Roberts was the last residence hall to be treated for radon gas con tamination, and the remedial action there was completed in February, 1991. ""Our goals were very clearly set-- right from the beginning,"" McCormick concluded, "" I'm very pleased with how the program went."" do the jobs that we were hired to do."" Two percent will be the aver age increase in a department's oper ating budget. The operating budgets for some departments will increase above the two percent average. One example is the library which will increase its operating budget by nine percent, still not enough to combat increasing subscription rates. ""Even with that nine percent increase in the library budget we still have to make absolute cuts in the number of jour nals and books purchased because they're inflating at a rate that far ex ceeds nine percent year after year,"" said Moohr. Another example, the finan cial aid office will operate according to a budget increased by 13.5 per cent ""That means we're doing real butchering elsewhere,"" said Moohr. To counter increases above two percent by operations such as the li brary and financial aid, other depart ments' operating budgets will not increase at all. According to Moohr, budget ary limitations enforced for the coming year will have no lasting ef fect on the University, although, if the limitations are part of a trend to wards reduced spending, the Uni versity would have to completely re work its allocation o f money, he said. ""We can live with these bud get cuts for one year, tightening our belts. The real question is, 'Is this going to be part of a long-term pat tern?' ... If that happens, I think it will move us into a much weaker com petitive position,"" Moohr said. But Moohr doesn't foresee such a trend, stating that most trust ees are pleased to see Bucknell be come a more competitive institution. The budget revisions became necessary after the trustees opted for a 4.5 percent increase in the com prehensive fee as opposed to the 6.7 percent increase Moohr's committee proposed. According to Maxwell, three factors influenced the trustees: a concern over the national economy, changing student demo graphics, and price sensitivity. Maxwell said, "" I think those same reasons that existed in No vember are still valid concerns."" According to Moohr, these three factors are strong arguments in favor of increasing the comprehen sive fee. If the national economy does cause lay-offs, it will reduce the number of students who can afford to go to Buckncll. ""That's all the more reason to have a higher com prehensive fee to make up for those lost revenues,"" he noted. Moohr also pointed out that despite major reductions in appli cants to frame of reference schools, Buckncll's applicant pool has re mained stable. The number of ap plicants for the incoming freshman class is down by 30 people from last year's class. On average, Bucknell receives 6,000 applications."

P R E S S,"By Joyce Dollinger At Monday's faculty meeting Janice Butler, director o f the Women's Resource Center, intro duced a new proposal for dealing with cases of sexual assault. Butler represented the Committee on Re spect and Equality (CRE) by intro ducing a proposal which the group hopes will serve as an interim policy later to be incorporated into a revised University disciplinary and judicial system, which is currently being re viewed by the Committee to Review Conduct Regulations. According to Butler, "" This matter was brought to the faculty's attention so that they would be aware of suggested changes and have an opportunity to offer feedback to President Sojka."" Sojka suggested that faculty should respond by April 24. In addition, Butler said that she and Arlyne Hoyt, director of Psychological Services, originally proposed the policy to Sojka because they feel existing policy is insuffi cient in handling assaulted students. "" Because o f our experiences in dealing with students who have been sexually assaulted by acquaintances or raped by dates, we feel a change from current practice is advisable,"" said Butler. The proposal which Butler in troduced to the faculty was one of two similar policies being discussed by organizations on campus. The other proposal which was, written by the Committee on Complemen tary Activities (C C A ), presents slightly different alternatives to the proposal drafted by CRE. The C R E  proposal and the C C A  draft differ on several points. For example, the CRE advocates that the committee designated to hear sexual assault cases include only three members. C C A  recommends a committee of five. Both groups agree that the se lected panel should benefit from psychological training so the group will be "" smooth, efficient, fair and sensitive to the alleged victim ' s rights as well as for the accused,"" said Rick Gatteau '92, chair of C C A . C C A  has not completed its fi nal amended draft of the CRE pro posal. "" We want to cover every angle o f the proposal before we make it final,"" said Gatteau. However, in her presentation to the faculty, Butler introduced a few of C C A 's suggestions along with the presentation o f her own committee's proposal. C R E , a committee of staff, faculty and students, was the first group to initiate discussion con cerning the handling of sexual as sault cases on campus. The committee, formed by Charlotte Weddle, associate vice president for student life, deemed it necessary ""to make it more acces sible to students who had been vic timized."" CR E presented its proposal to Sojka in February. Sojka then sub mitted it to C C A , which began to review and revise the proposal. \"

U.S. begins aid,
to fleeing Kurds,"After extensive pressure, President Bush ordered Air Force officers to begin giving aid to thou sands of Kurds fleeing Iran and Turkey. At least 1,500 refugees have already died trying to reach Turkey, and tension has risen in tensely between the refugees and soldiers protecting their borders. Six U.S. Cargo planes left Turkish air bases to distribute sup plies to Kurdish refugees. Among the items sent were packaged meals, medical supplies, and bottled water. President Bush also plans to donate $869,000 to the United relief funds to aid victims of the Persian Gulf War. The International Red Cross will also be given $131,000 and 1,000 tons of food by the United States. Since Iraq invaded Kuwait in August, Washington has contributed $35 million to internal organization to assist refugees. Britain, France, Germany, and Switzerland are among other countries sending sup plies to help the Kurds."
Soviets review,
restoration plan,President Mikhail
S.,"Gorbachev presented and ""anti-cri sis program"" to the Supreme Soviet all-union Parliament, as the Soviet Union nears economic failure and an stagnation of power. Gorbachev's plan demands restoration of the chair of authority and a delay on strikes and demonstrations for the duration [ of the one-year program. While Gorbachev focused on l restoring discipline to the economy and the society at the expense of the democracy, he basically avoided specific threats or detailed plans for the enforcement of his program. So viet Union Prime Minister Balentin S. Pavlov, who established the eco nomic features of the program, cen tered on putting resources into agri culture and restoring financial sta bility. His plan also urged an in crease in the privatization trade and public services. Gorbachev's first priority is to maintain the state, as only then can he formulate the rest of his program."
Israel agress,
to begin talks,"Even though Israel said that it was willing to attend a regional peace meeting co-sponsored by Washington and Moscow, American officials said that there is no appar ent agreement between Washington and Israel or between Secretary of State James A. Baker, III and For eign Minister David Levy of Israel, the Israelis expressed a willingness to attend a one-time regional meet ing for direct talks between Israel and the Arab nations and Israel and the Palestinians. However, Israel failed to agree on how the talks would be structured, what the agenda would be, when the talks would be held, and who would rep resent the Palestinians. While Israelis want the con ference to be a one-time event led by the United States and the Soviet Union, Arabs want some type of permanent situation to which they can refer if problems develop. The Israelis also want only Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza Strip represented, which excludes many prominent Palestinians and anyone connected with the P.L.O."
Unemployment,
rate increases,"The national unemployment rate rose to 6.8% in March, bringing the total number of people looking for woik near 8.6 million. This fig ure is recorded as the highest rate since late 1986. The overall view of the economy in March was revealed to be more negative than expected. Aside from the low stock prices and the decreasing Dow Jones industrial average, the report also showed more involuntary and dis couraged parttime workers, larger spells without work, and shorter workweek. With job losses concen trated in manufacturing, construc tion and retail, and wholesale trade, the number of payroll jobs sunk an other 206,000 in March. Geographically, all eleven biggest industrial stated had in creases in their unemployment rates last month, with Texas having the largest jump of 1.1 percentage points to 6.6 percent."
Senators killed,
in crashes,"Senator John Heinz, 52, and former Senator John G. Tower, 65, were both killed last week in freak flight accidents. Heinz died of Thursday, April 4, when his commuter aircraft crashed into a helicopter which had been called upon to check for any noticeable difficulties in the landing gear.

Ryan to lecture,
on Holocaust,"Allan Ryan, Jr., university at torney at Harvard, professor of hu man rights law at Boston College Law School, and former director for the Office of Special Investigations with the U.S. Justice Department is scheduled to give a lecture on ""Nazi War Criminals in America: Legal Issues, Moral Issues"" during Buck- nell University's annual Holocaust Memorial program. Ryan is a graduate of Dartmouth College and the Univer sity of Minnesota Law School, where he was President of the Min nesota Law Review. From 1980 to 1983, he served as the Director of the Justice Department's newly created Office of Special Investigations where he lead the investigation and prosecution of Nazi war criminals in America. In 1988, Ryan presented the case against Kurt Waldheim be fore the International Commission of Inquiry, and was featured in the 1989 Academy Award-winning documentary, ""Hotel Terminus: The Life and Times of Klaus Barbie."" He has received honors from both Yad Vashem and President Reagan, attaining the title of Meritoriuos Executive from the lat ter. The lecture will take place on Tuesday, April 16, in the Langone Center Forum at 8:00 p.m., and will be followed by a reception in Walls Lounge."
"Prof, charged",
with harassment,"Abraham Ordover, a professor at Emory University Law School in Atlanta, Georgia, after being cleared of sexual harassment charges, re signed on April 1. This decision was due to the protest of 300 students who boycotted class and marched on the school administration building near March 19. Ordover was acquitted of all charges by a law school faculty committee the day before the boy cott; and two days after the protests began, he took a temporary leave of absence from his position, ultimately resulting in his permanent resigna tion. Ordover was accused of kiss ing, touching, and making sexual advances toward 13 female students against their will. At least one of the students did not have the opportunity to speak before the committee, according to Scott Sanders, president of the Stu dent Bar Association. Sanders is a third year law student who organized a meeting with Dean Howard O. Hunter and President James Laney to protest the final decision, a charge of inappropriate behavior and a for mal reprimand. Since the initial complaints, several more students and alumni have come forward with similar chaises of sexual harassment against Ordover, bringing the total number to approximately twenty."

Hazing plagues,
campuses,"As more fraternities and so rorities are punished for hazing, Universities from over the United States continue to wonder how to stop such practices. Fraternities at Alfred State, Baylor, Vanderbilt, and Seton Hall have all been disciplined for hazing. Among the hazing crimes committed were possession of stolen property and theft. Many campuses are consider ing restrictions and fewer are abol ishing fraternities at their universi ties. Officials of Alfred State in New York have decided to meet to estab lish the future existence of their fra ternities; it was on this same cam pus in 1978, that a fraternity pledge, Chuck Stenzel, died during hazing procedures. Stenzel's mother, who spoke to all fraternity and sorority pledges at Bucknell University ear lier this semester, began an anti-haz ing program to stop such practices from occurring. Some fraternities have actu ally eliminated the pledge period to totally eliminate hazing incidents. Universities, as well as fraternity chapters, remain unsure of how to stop such events, but will do what ever is necessary to prevent any fur ther hazing. killing two children and injuring a number of others. The second air disaster, which involved former Senator Tower, oc curred five miles north of Brunswick, Florida, the Embraer 120, another commuter airplane, re portedly fell straight down before crashing into a pine forest. Former Senator Tower was accompanied by his 35-year old daughter, Marian Tower, and was en route to the Sea Island in Georgia. He had recently published a book entitled ""Consequences: A Personal and Political Memoir."" Heading both Federal Investigations will be Susan Coughlin, and the details of the findings will be released at a later date."
LA police chief,
reinstated,"Daryl F. Gates was reinstated to his position as Los Angeles chief of police after being temporarily ousted on April 4 due to the contro versial March 3 videotape of police officers brutally beating Rodney G. King. The decision to temporarily remove him was made by the three present members of the five member commission. One individual was out of the country, and the other seat was vacant. Gates was replaced, amidst much controversy, by David Dotson, 57. Gates' lawyer. Jay Grodin, said that Gates would file suit Monday, April 8, in the hopes of overturning the action. Grodin declared the sus pension to be ""unprecedented,"" and added that ""we have no investiga tion; we have no facts."" In the days before Gates was reinstated, some officers of the Los Angeles Police Force had begun wearing black tape on their badges as a sign of mourning. Gates' sus pension had been scheduled to last for 60 days."

Campus landscape to remain similar for a decade,"By Timothy Amman Staff Writer Despite numerous rumors to the contrary, it appears that the landscape of the Bucknell campus will remain quite similar to its present condition for at least another decade. Although proposals to rede sign the entrance to campus and change traffic flow on Seventh Street do exist, there are no plans to accomplish these objectives in the near future. The Helverson Group from Boston worked with Bucknell offi cials for about a year on various proposals for improved landscaping and campus beautification. The re sults of their findings are contained in a report which specifies suggested improvements to be made over the next ten to twenty years at Bucknell. For instance, according to Barry Maxwell, Vice President for Administration, the creation of an academic quad between Olin Sci ence Building and Dana Engineering Building ""is a component of a long range plan for the University."" An other recommendation includes ""re- designing the intersection at Seventh Street and Moore Avenue to align pedestrian and vehicular flow,"" in cluding the removal of Stuck House and the Old Bison, and the reloca tion of Seventh Street House. As it is now, the stop sign and pedestrian crossing do not match and need to be modified for safety reasons. A third major recommended modifica tion involves redesigning the en trance to campus, putting a traffic circle in front of Rooke Chapel and eventual replacement of Faculty Court. However, according to Max well, these proposals are ""all very expensive and require talks with trustees as well as extensive campus discussion"" before any work is be gun. Maxwell did indicate that some recommendations such as bet ter lighting, placement of bicycle racks, flower beds, etc. ""can all be accomplished within budgeted funds."" Thus, these types of opera tions will be done on a continuing basis. Furthermore, Maxwell indi cated that the cherry trees in the academic quad are reaching the end of their useful lives and thus will be replaced early in 1994. n r"

PELL grants,"From page 1 pledge covers a student throughout the year. In his original motion, Baker recommended that the University take one of two actions: either all Bucknell students be forced to sign a similar pledge, or, if a Bucknell student's PELL grant were revoked for an illegal drug use violation, then Bucknell would be responsible for replacing the lost grant money. President Sojka expressed his concern that the faculty had voted in support of the Baker motion while the BSG had voted almost unani mously against the motion. Baker said that he didn't feel it was appropriate to punish a low income student ""for getting high with their friend over the summer."" He noted that this type of behavior would not warrant kicking a student off cumpus, but that a low-income student who loses his PELL Grant for some reason couldn'tafford to go to Bucknell. This discrepancy is discriminatory according to Baker. Alex Sherer '93, president of the BSG, said, ""I don't see it as be ing discriminatory in the same way as the faculty. The main idea is that drug usage is contrary to federal law."" Sherer suggested that it was unfair for tuition paying Buckncli- ians to subsidize those students"
Incinerator,"From page 1 the waste get here, and how far does it have to come?"" Noting that there are 1,500 transportation accidents with chemicals each year, Shinn questioned the safety of transporting hazardous waste by rail and highway near the federal correctional facili ties in Lewisburg and Allcnwood, the Susquehanna River, and through the Bucknell campus on Route 15. Shinn felt the motion was an approprate public statement of ""a faculty speaking on behalf of itself."" Some of Shinn's concerns were echoed by President Gary Sojka, who questioned the safety of siting the facility near the Susquehanna River. Questioning critics who see local opposition as simply an instance of ""not in my backyard"" syndrome, Sojka empha sized the danger to the Chesapeake Bay, which is fed by the Susquehanna. After extensive at tempts to reduce pollution of the Bay and reverse past damage, Sojka questioned the wisdom of con structing a facility which poses a significant threat to that progress. Steve Becker, chair and asso ciate professor of physics, addressed the potential danger to prisoners, saying that ""in principle, people could move out of the area"" if the in cinerator is built, but that inmates at Allenwood, a mile and a half from the proposed site and soon to be the largest federal prison complex, do not have that option. The faculty motion, passed on a voice vote, follows President Sojka's declaration last month that the University as an institution would not take a stand on the pro posed incinerator, but that campus groups with the apparatus to debate the matter, such as the faculty, were encouraged to do so. The local controversy began last October when USPCI, Inc., a unit of the Union Pacific Corpora tion, first announced plans to con struct a $100 million hazardous waste incinerator on 700 acres in Gregg Township, in northern Union County near the village of Allenwood. Since that time Organi zations United for the Environment (OUE), the citizens' group opposing the project, has gained over 12,000 members and garnered national at tention. The permitting process which USPCI must follow with the state Department of Environmental Resources is expected to take two years."

10% discount with student B.U. LD.,"found in violation of federal law. He also said that the motion could take financial aid away from other Bucknellians who are not violating federal law. ""I have to assume that they [the BSG] were somewhat misin formed about the motion,"" said Baker. Sherer countered saying, ""I do not agree that congress was misin formed. We discussed the faculty's motion and their reasoning at length, and Dean Baker's proposal was is sued in verbatim."" Longley, who supported this motion, moved for the reconsidera tion because of difficulties that have arisen as the administration attempts to design implementation of the policy. Baker then withdrew his motion, substituting a motion which scrapped the universal student pledge. Instead he suggested sending a letter to PELL recipients explain ing that the drug pledge is a federal policy, and that the University does not condone the policy because it is discriminatory. Retaining the heart of his measure, the compensation of lost grant money with Bucknell funds, Baker defined the issue as one of making sure students ""won't lose financial aid and be forced off cam pus for something other students won't be thrown off campus for."" President Gary Sojka attacked this position, addressing the concern that ""we will remove financial aid from some other student if we must make up for lost federal money with institutional money."" It was also noted that Ron Laszewski, director of financial aid, knew of no cases where a student has lost PELL grants due to a drug con viction, and ""it is unlikely it would happen in the future."" After wrangling over the lan guage of what Sojka described as ""a very carefully worded letter"" to stu dents, the decision was made to table the motion until the first meeting of the fall semester, so that officials could hammer out the language of a perspective letter to students. At the suggestion of Faculty Chair David Ray that ""dissatisfac tion with that [federal] policy should be registered, a motion to that effect was passed by voice vote, with ap proximately ten negative votes."""

Bio building,"From page 1 Dana Engineering, the Bertrand li brary, and Cooley Hall. Jim Hostetler, manager of construction for the physical plant, agreed that the project is proceeding smoothly. He sees the biology pro gram and curriculum areas as the largest and most important compo nent of the building, and is optimis tic that those areas will be completed on time. Since the building is ""much like chemistry,"" he says crews are ""moving along much faster than in phase one."" The center atrium, which con nects the biology building with the chemistry building, is of lesser im portance, and need not be com pletely finished before the building opens. Construction of the atrium, however, ""is progressing right on schedule, but there are a lot of un knowns,"" Hostetler warned. Harclerode seemed excited about the potential of the completed building: ""It's a magnificent facility, well-designed and well-planned."" He noted that one out of every nine Bucknell students is a biology ma jor, and another one out of nine takes a biology course during his or her four years here. ""The new building completely updates the department,"" Harclerode said. He also observed that Bucknell's biology department is the fifth largest in the nation in terms of sending students on to receive doc torate degrees. ""This building will allow us to do that better,"" he said. The new building features laboratories for both non-major and freshman and sophomore bio-major core courses on the first floor, and labs for upper-level biology courses on the higher floors. Furthermore, each professor's office and personal research lab arc located on the same level as the large teaching laboratory where his or her courses are taught. Indeed, the building was de signed around the needs of the fac ulty. Harclerode said his favorite part of the building is the third floor, where his office and lab are located. ""It fits together so well function- wise; everything's there I need to do."" The design is far more than simply functional, however. Its aes thetic details, especially the central connecting section, will dominate the campus when complete. The atrium, with its huge, back-lit glass dome, will be the focal point for visitors approaching the University along 7th Street. Inside, the atrium will be equally ""stunning,"" according to"
Bucknell's biology departm ent is the fifth,
largest in the nation in terms of sending,
students on to receive doctorate degrees.,
"""This building will allow  us to do that better.""",

He listed a few of the fea tures of the new section: granite steps and bluestone flooring at the outer entrance, a set of glass doors, and then terrazzo flooring with brass floor inserts depicting the four sym bols of alchemy: earth, fire, water and air. There will also be an 85-foot clear view up to the dome on the in side. HosteUer also commented that the third floor will feature ""two ex tremely well-appointed lounges."" Each will have very high ceilings with multiple skylights and floor-to- ceiling windows looking outside. The lounge on the west side of the building will be for faculty and staff, while the students' lounge will face Dana Engineering and the Susquehanna river. After the biology building is complete and the department has moved out of its offices in Taylor and Botany, renovation will begin of the Botany building. Following that renovation, ""the Botany building will be re-assigned to the Career Development Center [CDC] and the personnel office,"" Maxwell said. The space the CDC vacates in Carnegie will then be used by the geology department. No decision has yet been made concerning which cam pus group will occupy Taylor Hall. Phase three of the science cen ter complex, which has yet to be scheduled, will involve the con struction of a psychology building and the complete renovation of the Carnegie building for geology. When built, the new 50,000 square foot psychology building will be situated across from the computer center in the open space next to Olin and behind the biology building. It will connect to the biology building through the use of knock-out panels already installed in that building's foundation."

From page 1,"according to Weddle, is to serve ""as a clearing house for the ideas of the individual committees."" Of major concern for Presi dent Sojka, Weddle, and Skena from the outset was student in volvement in the changes being brought about by TIP. The com mittees are ""mainly comprised of students,"" Weddle said, with some involvement and guidance from the administration, particularly from student life, and several faculty. But student involvement has met with varying degrees of suc cess. Some of the student chairs have been very pleased with the administration's ability to relinquish control. ""We've been very inde pendent,"" said Bob Ritter '92, co chair of the committee on residential changes. ""Charlotte would offer ideas here and there, but we were free to formulate our own recom mendations."" Alex Bergmann '92, chair of the committee on the freshman year experience, was also pleased with the way the administration handled TIP, but said that they might have ""saved a lot of time and effort"" with an administrator in charge of the committee because ""students just don't have the time to deal with it."" Others were not as pleased with the way the administration acted. Steve Hoerter '91, co-chair of the committee on the four-year residency requirement, feels that ""the whole process has been admin istration-led,"" and has been ""too closely tied to Residential Life."" ""Whether that's the fault of the ad ministration or the student body, I'm not sure,"" Hoerter said. Some of the faculty seemed a bit confused by TIP's method of op eration. Dick Henry, professor of physics and a member of the com mittee on Greek life, said, ""It was really very mysterious to me. It was all thrown to the students."" He said ""weird"" was the only word to de scribe iL His committee never had a set meeting time and strange items sometimes appeared on the agenda. However, he did think that ""it was a good idea to have students running the committees."" ""In terms of how the changes were done, it was stu dents who had the most influence,"" and this, he thought, was what TIP needed to give it validity with the students in general. Skena and Weddle both stress the importance of student input. ""We are going to suffer if students don't stay abreast of what's going on,"" says Weddle. Although students have been the main contributors to the committees, it has only been a small percentage of the student body which has been involved at all. Hoerter said that ""people haven't taken the initia tive to become involved,"" and, as a result, the students will end up being ""reactive instead of proactive."" Ritter feels that ""if the administration gives them the chance, then the burden's on the students"" to get in volved. The process that the commit tees have followed was roughly bro ken down into three stages. Stage one was to write preliminary reports. These were all finished by February. The reports then led directly to stage two of the process. Stage two involved getting in put on the preliminary reports from as many sources as possible. For that purpose, open forums, which Skena says were ""widely advertised,"" were held and all of the preliminary reports were put on reserve at Bertrand Li brary. The hope was that the forums would ""allow all members of the University community to comment on the proposals,"" said Weddle. The third and present stage of the process involves writing the final report to be submitted to Sojka. This report will encompass the initial rec ommendations of the preliminary re port, adjusted for any questions, con cerns or recommendations offered at the open forum. Members of the Bucknell community are also being encour aged to review the TIP reports and the initial TIP guidelines, all of which are on reserve in the Bertrand Library, to give input and sugges tions on the recommendations. At this point, Weddle recommends that any ""input should be addressed to the president."""

Spellbound brings,
jazz to the Bison,"By Carl Walker Jazz has returned to the Bi son with the Jazz and Blues Ex press music series sponsored by Bison Programming and AACF. The series began Sunday with the New York-based fusion group Mike Freeman and Spellbound. In a polished and profes sional show, the band promoted their new CD with original com positions written by vibraphonist and band leader Mike Freeman. They opened up with ""Serendip ity,"" a mixture of intricate chords and textures supplied by Freeman and guitarist Paul Myers layered over the steady groove of bassist Norbert Marias and drummer Tom Cohen. They continued with more material from the CD, showing their heavy Latin and funk influ- ences. Of particular note was ""Channels"" in which Norbert broke away from the foundation and played a technical and melodic solo. Freeman's song-writing es pecially shone through on ""Eastern Lights,"" a slower song with an ex tended vibraphone intro. The band came together on the pedal-to-the- mctal song ""Mint Tea"" in which the fast unison line seemed effort less and natural. Spellbound was more than four great musicians; it was a co hesive unit Founded by Freeman in 1985, the band currently plays in clubs and colleges around the Northeast. Be sure not to miss the next Bison Jazz and Blues Express fea turing Zydeco, a combination of cajun, blues and reggae, with Ma jor Handy, this Sunday at 7 p.m."
Dance Co. holds,
informal showing,"By Karen Ebersoid Staff Writer The Bucknell Dance Com pany held a showing of current pieces and works-in-progress by faculty and students April 4 in Tustin Theatre. Guest performers included two dance classes and visiting artists from New York University. A highlight of the concert was the performance of the Jazz I and Flamenco dance classes. ""Touch Faith,"" the jazz piece choreographed by Shellie Cash-Muller, assistant professor of dance, was filled with energy and spirit. Professor Cash- Muller's Flamenco class performed a unique rhythmic dance of Spanish influence, ""Sevillanas (First Copla) and Bulerias."" ""Women's Songs,"" an expres sive and humorous piece by Assis tant Professor of Dance Danna Frangione, featured vocalist Catherine Roth, an English professor at Dickinson College. Rather than using music for ""Oh, Mother,"" di rector of movement Janelle Oltorik '93 set her dancers against an ex cerpt from Kahil Gabran's poem ""The Prophet."" Other pieces in cluded ""Far From Over,"" a moving solo performed by Amy Kantor '94; ""Harry,"" a jazz trio choreographed by Oltorik; and ""Challenge of the Warriors,"" a piece charged with a native beat choreographed by Erin Hunter '92. The last three works of the show were choreographed and per formed by visiting artists form the NYU/Tisch School for the Arts. ""Untitled"" and ""Haiku"" displayed expressive motion and thought, and ""First Kiss"" rounded out the show with a charming combination of act ing and dancing. Each piece was unique and re freshing, leaving the audience to look forward to the Dance Company's annual spring concert May 10 and 11 at the Weis Center."

Bison Tales,"By Marc Haimes Staff Writer They appear after Spring Break. Consistently clad in white cotton shirts and shorts, oblivious to the wind-chill-factor. Their boisterous smiles sparkle with ex-"
I,"tra shine against their sun- muddened complexions... The irony is, we actually give them compliments. We say things like, ""Hey! Great tan! Nice going! I just can't believe how tan you are!"" As if shelling out money for air-fare and baking on a blan ket for an entire week is some great accomplishment. And it seems like these mesquite-menaces can't even accept our praise graciously. They reply, ""You think I'm tan?!? God, are you kidding! I'm practi cally pale now! You should have seen me a week ago when they had to pry me off my beech towel with a spatula, I was REALLY dark then."" ""Yeah, whatever you say,"" I I mumbled as I ran for my bathing suit this past weekend, hoping that five hours under the Lewisburg sun minus any type of protective covering would be all I needed to ""catch up"" to the sooty show-offs. That evening, my skin glowed brightly beneath three coats of Noxema applied in a futile effort to relieve the pain. After writhing under electric sheets in basted agony, I awoke the next day to discover that my pigment had al ready returned to its normal death- white tint. I think the generic appeal of ""the sun-tan"" is that it makes a per son look ""healthy"" with almost no hassle. You don't even have to ex ercise! Never mind all that blab bering about UV light, wrinkles, and noses falling off; looking healthy without the pains of diets or jumping jacks is IN. Even fast-food chains have realized this fact. McDonalds, for example, has expanded their se lection of flavorful low-calorie items beyond the realm of Diet Coke and Mclce-Water. They are now featuring a special low-cal, low-fat burger which is reportedly almost as good as their regular stuff. They have named the creation...(you guessed it) ""McLEAN."" The secret of the sandwich's enhanced taste lies in the fact that the company has spe cially flavored the meat with Sea weed Extract Yummy. The Sea weed will supposedly provide moisture to the beef which was lost I when all those tangy fatty juices were lipposucked out. McDonalds is even developing a new ad-cam paign centered around the deli- I cious new producL ""McDonalds: FOOD, FOLKS, and FUNGUS."" If you try this novel creation and feel a little fishy, or get a little I green around the gills, you might be interested to know that, in addi- I tion to the seaweed, the pattie is also peppered with chemical-based ""flavor-enhancers"" like Monoso dium Glutamate (MSG). The job of MSG is to artificially stimulate I your tastebuds causing you to I think that your sodium saturated algae-burger tastes like Filet Mi- gnon. Now, even though this chemical is known to cause a va riety of reactions which include vomiting, migraines, and fever, the fact does remain that it is ex tremely low in calories. So if you want to look healthy this summer without ex erting too much energy or stifling your tastebuds, remember: Easy on the Suntan Lotion, Heavy on the"

neurona,"By Claire Davidson Staff Writer At some point in our lives we have all wished that we could have someone else take an exam for us; someone who could get us an A. In high school, twins Erin and Faith Hunter '92 used their similar ap pearance to do just this. After Faith had successfully completed her own math exam, she deviously switched clothes with her twin sister, and took the same exam an hour later. Not only does being twins allow these two sisters to engineer this type of trick, but it also gives each a unique relationship with someone on whom they can always depend. Another set of twins, seniors Cathleen and Caroline Shantz not only both go to Bucknell but live in the same mod together. ""We have always been best friends,"" com mented Cathleen. She and Erin agree that the greatest advanatage of hav ing a twin is that there is always someone that they can count on to listen and genuinely care about them. ""It is like having a best friend with you all the time,"" Erin added. Freshman twins Sue and Ed Gegnas chose to come to Bucknell together because from the list of colleges they both were accepted to, Bucknell was their first choice. For Sue, as well as for Cathleen and Erin, growing up with a twin was a posi tive experience and they agree that the advanatages of having a twin outweigh any disadvantages. ""In high school we really didn't have that much competition"

I don't think we were ready to split up,"" she continued. Erin and her twin Faith also knew that they wanted to stay together. She explained that there was some competition between them but not in a negative way. Sue, who was in many of the same courses as her brother, added that although there was a lot of competi tion it wasn't ever verbalized. However, despite the similari ties between the twins, there are some differences that often are over-"

""People who don't know us would have trouble seeing the differences but I think I am a little more outgoing than Caroline."" Erin agreed that there are definitely differences between her and Faith, but their friends all have a different opinion about what they are. For Sue and Ed, living at Bucknell with a twin is also very different than being in high school. ""At Bucknell, I can go a week with out seeing my brother. I have to ac tually go and see him,"" commented Sue. At Bucknell, people arc not as aware of twins since it is a much larger environment and greater vari ety of classes and activities are of fered. ""We live more separate lives here at Bucknell. It is not much dif ferent. It's just not as noticeable,"" added Cathleen. In addition to the differences there are also some disadvantages. ""People see us as so similar that it is really hard to be an individual,"" said Cathleen. Erin agreed that some times being a twin is hard especially when they are both trying for some thing, like a role in a play or a posi tion on a sports team. ""Sometimes they might not want to hurt the other's feelings so they don't take either of us, "" explained Erin. ""It is also difficult for our parents around finals when we are both leaving at different times,"" added Sue. Aside from these few disad vantages, they all feel that they have a relationship with their twins that doesn ' t compare to any other kind of friendship. Cathleen commented, ""I know her so well that I know how she feels and how she thinks."" ""Sometimes we look at each other and know that we're thinking the same thing,"" added Erin. She also said that sometimes strange things happen to them. For example, during high school, the day before Erin fractured her arm during gym nastics, Faith's arm hurt in the same place. ""Even now that Faith is abroad for a semester, I still know what she is thinking and feeling,"" explained Erin."

Professors keep o leash,
on their popular puppies,"By David Soli Staff Writer Although the Bucknell Stu dent Government has passed a reso lution requiring all dogs to be on leashes while on campus, Bucknell professors still bring their dogs to school with them. They sec the dogs as a way to relieve the stress of a hard day, both for themselves and for their students. Perhaps the best-known pro fessor-pet pairing is Chair and Asso ciate Professor of Economics Michael Moohr and his Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, Christopher. Described as a ""very visual dog"" be cause of his hunting ancestry, Chris topher has been known to ""attack a rabbit on a greeting card."" Moohr's wife, president of Vassar College, gave him the dog so he ""would have someone to sleep with,"" since theirs is a commuter marriage. She ""ada mantly opposes"" allowing Christo pher to have a female doggie com panion, although Professor Moohr believes that his puppy should needs one. Moohr asked that concerned students ""petition his wife to let Christopher have a ladyfriend."" Another prominent dog on campus is Cooky, who belongs to the married couple of Owen Floody, professor and chair of psychology, and Andrea Halpem, associate pro fessor of psychology. The pair keeps the dog in one of their offices during the day, taking Cooky for walks be tween classes. A few years ago, Cooky was nearly killed by a swarm of yellowjackets while tied up out side the Langone Center. Professor of English John Murphy bravely cut Cooky's leash and Professor of Po litical Science Harry Blair rushed Cooky to the veterinarian. The couple received many calls from concerned witnesses. Katherine Faull, assistant pro fessor of Modem Languages, also appreciates her colleagues' love for her new dog, Brit. Other members of the department enjoy playing with Brit and, as Faull notes, ""She is a useful tool for teaching the impera tive."" Brit also caused a change in her wardrobe. She now occasionally dresses in black and white in an ef fort to color coordinate with her dal- matian. One of the most talented dogs on campus is Petra, the yodeling dog, who belongs to Assistant Professor of Psychology Chris O'Sullivan. Anyone who secs O'Sullivan driving will be able to hear Petra yodeling beside her. O'Sullivan is unsure why Petra howls, but thinks it might be her Oklahoma prairie heritage. Whatever the cause, Petra has come a long way since O'Sullivan found her severely malnourished and barely able to walk. Now, however, Petra is one of the sprightliest dogs on campus and vacations at Martha's Vineyard during the summer. Since most students cannot have an animal at college, they can rest assured that, with spring here, their professor's dogs will be out in full bloom. Right: Professor Moohr and his loverlorn cocker spaniel Christo pher are a familiar sight on the academic quad. Maybe Christo pher should meet Brit, Professor Fault's dalmatian? [below] Brit helps Faull teach the imperative in her German classes. Photos by Allison Zadroga / The Bucknellian"
Mailroom staff handles with care,"Ashley Chertkof / The Bucknellian Are they psychics? Maxine Gray and Mary Dougherty can match students to their box numbers from a distance. Gray and Dougherty control all the mail that enters the Langone Center mailroom. By Sue Basalla Staff Writer Mountains of J. Crew cata logs. Heaps of campus mail ad dressed simply to ""Bill."" Piles of letters for long-gone alumni. Faced with all these hazards, mailroom manager Maxine Gray and her as sistant Mary Dougherty still some how learn to match the names, faces and box numbers of almost every student just by handing out pack ages. By the time freshmen have become sophmores, Gray and Dougherty can spot a student across the mailroom, dart back to pick out the correct package, and have it ready before the student can reach the window. How do they do it? ""It just happens,"" according to Gray, ""By sophomore year, we usually know almost everyone, especially someone who gets packages often. Some of the seniors who've worked here for four years can do it too."" The most popular form of stu dent mail, packages generally arrive more frequently around holidays. Christmas and Valentine's Day are notoriously busy, although, strangely enough, commented Dougherty, ""St. Patrick's Day was really big this year."" Gray added, ""Whatever reason parents can find to send packages, they will."" The mailroom staff, consisting of Gray, Dougherty and 20 student employees, starts each weekday at 8 a.m., sorting the first-class mail (which is put in the mailboxes first) from the third-class bulk mail (which is put in later). Gray commented that, ""Contrary to popular belief, campus mail is delivered all day long, when ever it's received."" On Saturdays, the mailroom is run entirely by students. At 8 a.m. every Saturday, Brian Bastress '93 picks up the mail at the Lewisburg Post Office in a university van. Bastress and four other students sort and deliver all the mail and put package pick-up slips in the appro priate boxes. When the window opens at 11 a.m., students hand out all the packages. While students are home dur ing the summer, Gray and Dougherty are busy changing the la bels on all the mailboxes. They tear off all the senior names (on the mailroom side of each box) and re place them with freshmen names. The mailroom staff is also re sponsible for forwarding misdi rected mail. Letters addressed to stu dents who have transferred, gradu ated or gone abroad must be for warded to the proper address. Until as recently as this fall, the staff had to hand-write the new addresses on each forwarded letter. Last Septem- ber, however, the mailroom received a computer which prints out address labels, saving them hours of work every day. The installation of the com puter is a sign of the increasing amount of mail in recent years. Gray said, ""The volume has really ex panded since I've been here, about eight or nine years. There are more students, and especially more cata- logs, these days."" Since Gray and Dougherty are employed by Bucknell rather than the federal government, they cannot sell postage or ship packages as the Marts Hall post office employees do. The greatest advantage of being Bucknell-employed is, according to Gray, ""We see the students on a regular basis and get to know them."" And their box numbers as well."

Crime Pays,"The Baker proposal is preposterous! The fact that the faculty initially endorsed it is even more so. If the University decided to reimburse criminals for their lost PELL grants, then financial aid would be di verted from other students who receive aid from the University. Under the same line of reasoning employed by the faculty, this would clearly discriminate against law-abiding Bucknellians. Do we fight discrimination with discrimi nation? Would doing so alleviate the problem or exacerbate it? The other option in the proposal would require that all students sign the same disclaimer concerning drug use. While this option seems more appealing on the surface, it could possibly reduce Bucknell's applicant pool because students would be uneasy about a disclaimer that other schools do not employ. Furthermore, what action would the University take against those students who refuse to sign? At the very heart of the debate is not only the impracticably of the motion, but also its spirit. Is it appropriate for a democratic society to decide that it will not subsidize higher education for individuals found in violation of the law? Should crime pay? The war on drugs costs this nation dearly, both in dollars and in human lives, and it is quite appropriate for those who perpetuate the demand for illegal contraband to be punished. Receiving a PELL grant is not a right of students but rather a privilege. Grant recipients are in effect asking their government to pay for part of their educa tion, and in return, they have a responsibility to abide by the laws of their government. Clearly, Sojka was in a quandary when the BSG voted nearly unanimously against a motion that the faculty had previously passed. When the two deliberative bodies are at odds, whose decision should be given preference? The answer: the group more affected by the decision. How would the faculty react if the BSG began making deci sions on tenure and raises for the faculty?"
Dress Denim with Tie,"Don't forget to vote this Wednesday, April 17! When you go to the wardrobe to select your clothes for the day, you will, in essence, be voting. If you select jeans, you are voting for equal rights for all human beings, including homosexuals and bisexuals. If you make a conscious decision not to wear jeans, you are, in effect, condoning discrimination. Wearing jeans docs not mean that you support or condone homosexual behavior; it merely signifies a belief that all human beings arc endowed with the same inalienable rights regardless of their sexual orientation. The rift between the Ad Hoc Committee for Heterosexual Awareness (AHCHA) and Friends of Lesbians And Gays (FLAG) illustrates the misunderstanding over jeans day. AHCHA has an undeniable right to free speech, and the defacement of their chalkings by POWER is detest able and may have irreparably damaged the message which FLAG is trying to communicate to the campus. It is clear that two camps have formed, both of which feel threatened by each other. If progressive change is truly to be achieved, the two groups must work together, educate each other, and overcome their prejudices. The two positions are not irreconcilable. So, how should Bucknellians vote on Wednesday? We ""endorse"" wearing jeans with a jacket and tie or other formal attire, a clear statement that supports the equal rights of all people--heterosexuals, homosexuals, and bi sexuals"

Heterosexual pride,
day disturbs students,
...pride should not,
have to come only,
with the degrada,
tion of another per,
son or group of,
people.,"To the Editor: We would like to respond to the members of the newly visible group F.A.G. (friends of anti-gays) who have recently publicized April 17 (Bucknell's designated Jeans Day) as Het erosexual Pride Day. We want to ask: isn't every day hetero sexual pride day? One only has to watch five minutes of television or browse a popular magazine to see that heterosexu ality is the recognized ""norm"" in this country. There is nothing -- -- -- wrong with feeling pride in oneself and one's sexuality-- maybe we need more of that. But pride should not have to come only with the degradation of another person or group of people. Jeans Day is a day of recognition of rights for all people, focusing especially on those who are gay, lesbian, or bisexual. It is a celebration of diversity, not an attack on het erosexuality or any other differ ences. This new group and its offensive name and acronym have misinterpreted and twisted the meaning of Jeans Day, but to what end? Do they feel more heterosexual when they label themselves ""anti-gay""? And why do these individuals need to publicize their heterosexual pride since it is already accepted and celebrated by society? We want the group to realize that by sup porting homosex ual/hum an rights, no one is trying to oppose heterosexuality. The purpose is to see others as people with dif ferences, but also with rights. We would ask the group and individuals to continue to cel ebrate sexuality and diversity but to do so in a positive way, without needing to reduce oth ers and at tack their differences. We chal lenge the group to honestly ask themselves why they need to see and feel more hetero sexual affirmation. Doubts about one's sexual ity cause too many problems in relationships (heterosexual and homosexual) and in personal self-esteem. We hope the doubts that are driving this group to vehemently advocate and publi cize heterosexual pride day can be overcome before they become dangerous. We also hope the group will stop putting up the signs because they are offensive, abusive and demonstrate a poten tially harmful view of sexuality and individual differences.

Reader proposes amendments,
to cam pus dog leash policy,"To the Editor: Three cheers for Sandi Green! As a dog owner, I wish to take this opportunity to offer my support for the strict enforce ment of the pet leash law. I do this enthu siastically and ask only that one or two amendments be considered. Everyone is aware of the number of dog maulings that occur on this cam pus. Countless times I have seen a student pinned to the ground beneath the lathered snarl of a crazed canine. Sure, on a leash the dogs seem innocuous, cute even, but give them a taste of free dom and they go for the throat of the nearest Bucknellian. But I am not only concerned for the physical threat posed by these monsters; theft is also a sig nificant problem. How many times have students been hard at play on the quad, tossing a frisbee between themselves, when out of nowhere, usually from behind a convenient to the pound where they shall await liberation by their owners.

It is nigh time to take action! Victims unite! Put some teeth into this leash law! An excellent start has been made: unleashed animals will be ticketed by security and sent discover that their dog has gone missing. If they haven't claimed it by then, they obviously do not care about their dogs and pose a threat to the animals as well as the Bucknell community. The dog should be put to sleep after the two hour deadline has passed. Hell, we may not need a leash law after a couple of weeks enforcing my amendment Who can afford to keep replacing his dog? I further propose that dog owners be re quired to register their animals with security at a rate of, oh, about $200 per semester. Said owners would then have to lodge their dogs in assigned dog houses located by the stadium. I cannot see how anyone could find fault with the leash law and my amendments. We all realize the severity of the problem. One has simply to read the security log to realize that dog attacks are at an all-time high at Bucknell. Bravo to Ms. Green for having the guts to bring up such a hot issue and to Ms. Nicole Yates for suggesting that Green raise the issue. I am proud to offer my sup port Roger Adsett '91 April 9,1991"

Group's actions undermine civil,
rights of campus community,
By Corey Zayatz,
HOW IH V  V liV,"By Zoe Ingram Lately, I have seen many post ers around campus advocating that one wear either a coat and tie or a skirt or dress (i.e. no jeans) on April 17. This is supposedly to show one's support for heterosexuality. I find this rather distressing. Each day for the week leading up to Bucknell's Earth Day 1991 has been designated as an awareness day for a disenfranchised group of people. Every day during this week, programs will be held for everyone to learn about social, economic, and political inequalities. Our supposed equal opportunity ""land of the free"" not only condones, but actively supports inequality and selective discrimination. That this country actually does support the disenfran chisement of select groups of people flies in the face of our own ideals. The lessons that I have learned about what our country actually stands for have been difficult ones to learn and even harder to accept. However, the truth asserted itself and I was made to listen, however unwillingly at first The fact of the matter is that every day of every year is hetero sexual rights day. Our entire cul tures revolves around heterosexual ""norms."" How many movies, tele vision shows, or commercials has the average person seen during the past year that has had positive im ages of gay, lesbian, or bisexual people in them? How many love songs are there about same-sex rela tionships? Do people awkwardly stare at an obviously heterosexual couple holding hands in public? Why should people involved in same sex relationships have to hide all Why does Bucknell deem it permis sible to violate its own anti-dis crimination policy regarding sexual orientation even when that leaves the University liable? We live in a heterosexist, homophobic society. April 17 was designated by the Earth Day Plan ning Committee to be Gay/Lesbian/ Bisexual rights day. Accordingly, it is Jeans Day.

Lack of activities results from,
lack of campus support,
A,"By Dennis Barnes Last Sunday one of the best fusion jazz groups I have ever had the opportunity to hear played live in the Bison. Unfortunately, I was one of about thirty people who at tended the production. ""Cel ebrating Diversity"" was one of the recent slogans of our univer sity. I, for one, do not see that phi- 1 o s o p h y shared by very many people here. It seems to me that Bucknell tends to attract many people who are not willing to break out of their com fortable realms to experience something different I know how tough it is to consider alternative modes of thought and culture, but what better time or place to do so than right here and now. This piece was supposed to be an opin ion on Mike Freeman and Spell- bound, the group that played here last Sunday (who, by the way, was fantastic), but I feel compelled to say something more than that. I have been here for four years and I have heard, on many occa sions, people say things like ""...it's so boring here,"" ""...I have nothing to do,"" and ""...there's a lack of cul-"
It seems to me that Bucknell tends to at,
tract people who are not willing to break,
out of their comfortable realms to experi,
ence something different.,"tural expression here."" These com ments are quite true; but less true than was the case several years ago. Today, some of us are really trying to provide alternative activities that are culturally different and enlight ening. However, there is very little support for the events we brought to campus. I know and understand that not everyone cares to experience anything past the monotonously mundane, but I was under the im pression that there was a signifi cant population who was tired of that I honestly think that there is a good number of people who would like to check out something new and different. I just wish they (you) would come out to some of these activities and show your sup port. My point is this: if more support isn't shown, those who are trying so hard to get different events here will get discouraged and stop putting forth the effort. I guess that would make some people here happy (ignorance has always been quite blissful). I am a senior, but I do care about this university and it's continued de velopment past my time here. I know the students here can be more open-minded than they have thus far shown. scared. They are scared because some of them know people who have been beaten up or threatened be cause of ""affectional"" preference. Some are scared because if people knew, some of their friends might decide to no longer be their friends. Some are scared because they might be denied that teachers certificate, not get that high-paying position at the firm of their choice. Some are scared because if their parents found out, they would be ostracized and could very possibly lose an educa tion at Bucknell. There are so many weapons that can, and have been used against gay, lesbian, and bi sexual people right here at this cam pus. If none of your friends openly claim a gay, lesbian, or bisexual identity, its probably because they are afraid of you, the society we live in, or both. When I first came out as a bi sexual man at Bucknell, I lost a few friends, received a few death threats, and had to come to terms with a beautiful campus turned ugly by ha tred. The climate has improved since I have come here, but there is still a long way to go. The signs plastered around campus are one ex ample of just how far we have to go. What is most offensive about the sign is that they are sponsored by a group known a F.A.G. (Friends of Anti-Gays) There is a big difference between support of a positive iden tity of any group and disenfranchis ing another. Although I am bisexual, I support heterosexuality. I support it by helping heterosexual friends through problems, watching hetero sexual movies and television shows, by living in a heterosexual culture. The fact that F.A.G. is a bla tantly bigoted organization attempt ing to undermine a day for civil rights makes my stomach turn. The fact that I have heard people saying that they will wear suits to support an anti-gay group makes me scared. Because of my past experience, I know what women feel when they walk alone at night. I know the anxiety of passing a large group of men. I know to keep glancing at my feet at night so I can see if there are any shadows approaching from be hind. How much longer will we al low this to happen on our campus? For these reasons, and many, many more I will walk in the Take Back the Night march, wear jeans--no tie and jacket--on Jeans Day, and par ticipate in the multi-cultural and other awareness day programs. Please, help stop the terror, if only by keeping an open mind and will ingness to learn about others differ ent from you. ANT i- l . V  S o fc C  CnCCK ACTCfrtATlC C  Aft. VlC vATtCN T*C.*CT"
THE FUTURE OF BUCKNELL LAW,

Skena's,
Prescription,"By David Skena This weekend is appropria tions weekend. If you belong to any student clubs your group may be applying for BSG funds right now. Over the past few weeks many people have expressed concerns about the appropriations process. Regardless of the cause, almost ev eryone feels that they have been treated badly by the Appropriations Committee. Complaints of ""we al ways used to get money for this..."" or ""why did group bla bla bla receive 100% when we only got 28% of our request?"" are very common. These concerns are legitimate and they force one to look at the root of the problem. The source of all the trouble is the fact that more and more groups are trying to grab bigger pieces of the Student Activities fee pie. The pie, however, isn't getting any bigger. The problem can be resolved by raising the Student Activities fee of every student or by clubs scaling back their activities. The Appro priations Committee must ask the BSG to ""raise taxes"" or cut back programs, the same dilemma faced by the Federal Government Unlike the U.S. Government the BSG can not go into debt. If the student groups on this campus want enough funding avail able for every request they should speak to the BSG congress and lobby that the Student Activities fee be significantly raised. If the student body feels $100 a head is enough, then they should make the BSG aware of that. This might be a good time for a referendum on the issue. In any event, the appropriations is sue will continue to be debated. If you have a complaint, voice it, but remember that the Appropriations Committee does its very best to be as fair and equitable as it can. The committee of 15 is comprised en tirely of students who receive no pay for their efforts. As you enjoy your weekend, remember that each of these students is devoting 12 hours of his or her time to ensure every student group will have enough funding to con tinue its existence at Bucknell. Feel free to complain if you want change, then offer assistance if you can."

Volleyball falls in season finale,
(Athlete of the week,
Team falls just shy of post-season berth in a grueling five game match,"Colin Bridgewater/The Bucknellian A Bison has his spike blocked by a Messiah middleblocker during last weekend's five game loss in Davis Gym. By Mike Lutz The Bucknell men's volley ball team was defeated this weekend in a close match against Messiah College. The match, which lasted for almost two and a half hours, went five games and the Bison lost 15-6, 12-15,6-15,15-8,17-15. The Bison started the first game very slowly and fell behind by a seven point deficit they could not overcome in a 15-6 loss. Bucknell did battle back though. Messiah overpassed Bucknell's serves on numerous occassions allowing Glenn Gesek '94 to increase his kill total to ten by the end of the second game. The Bison's dominance in the second game carried over to the third game. Setter Mike Lutz '94 jump- served five service aces to begin the third game giving the Bison a 5-0 advantage they would not relinquish. The Bison had the lead going into the fourth match and therefore felt very relaxed. This proved to be their downfall as they could not fin ish off Messiah. Messiah showed their experience creeping back into the match from behind winning eventually in a tie-breaker in the fifth game. Ben Jarosz '94 and Brian Sell '94 led the Bison with 21 and 17 kills, respectively. Gessek also contributed substantially with 14 kills, but only four of those came after the second game. The Bison ended the season on a sad note with this defeat, but overall the team played very well. The Bison were hurt by their lack of experience in the deciding game as they could not maintain a 12-8 ad vantage. The Bison was also hampered during the match by the absense of staring middle hitter Chris Dycka '93 who could not play because of a necker injury he sustained while training over spring break. When asked about the team's loss, Dycka stated, ""I was really sorry I did not get to play, but the guys played their hearts out and we are all looking foward to next year."" With the season brought to an end Jarosz reflected on the season. ""We really did not know what to expect going into the season. With four freshman starting we definitely lacked experience. And as any ath lete knows experience goes a long way. We are all looking forward to the next few years to see if we can make men's Bucknell volleyball a strong force in Pennsylvania. The sport is growing very rapidly at the collegiate level and we want to be a part of that growth,"" he said."
Bucknell crew stays afloat in G eorgia,"By Kyle Betz Last fall's watershed season ended triumphantly with both men's and women's Varsity Eight gold medals at the Frostbite regatta. As the Bison enjoy their second semester of varsity status, they have appropri ately chosen the hardest training and racing schedule yet. During spring break, the Bison travelled to Georgia for the 1991 Augusta Invitational Regatta. Forty teams, including the Canadian Na tional team and a Soviet squad, competed on March 30 at the Riverfront Marina beside the scenic Savannah River. Several Bison teams were able to place, led by the Men's Varsity Four who, won their heat and took silver in the finals with a time of 8:01.39. The Varsity Women's Eight qualified for the final, behind the na tional champion Wisconsin crew, but took fourth in the Dad Vail final with a time of 9:18.77. The Men's Varsity Lightweight Eight was able to qualify for the Dad Vail finals and ultimately took bronze with a time of 7:32.33. The Men's Novice Lightweight Eight took second with a time of 8:06.53, while the Men's Novice Heavyweight Eight took third despite equipment trouble during the race. The Women's Novice Eight came in third in the first round losing to tough Wiscon sin and UCF crews. On Sun. April 7, the Bison travelled to the Occoquan reservoir in Virginia to race George Mason, George Washington, and several other schools.

Softball takes two from Nittany Lions,
15-4-1 Lady Bison to play at Fordham tomorrow; they will then face formidable Army at West Point,"By Todd Bianchine Staff Writer The women's softball team successfully stretched their winning streak to six yesterday with a sweep of a doubleheader against Penn State, 1-0 and 3-2. The wins push Bucknell to 15-4-1 on the year with a perfect 2-0 record in league play. Although Bucknell ranks fifth in Division I for team scoring at 7.38 runs per game and seventh in the nation in batting average with .327, defense and good pitching proved to be the key factors in yesterday's games. In the first game Lisa Fink '93 beat out a throw to the plate to give Sharon Nichols '91 her sixth victory of the year as the Lady Bison won 1 - 0. Fink led off the seventh inning with a walk and advanced to second on Karen Smolskis's '91 bunt single, the only base hit for the Bison for the game. Carol Gessler '93 then hit a deep fly ball to center to move Fink over to third, setting up the table for Jill Szafranski '93. Szafranski fought off a couple of tough pitches then hit a hard grounder to third that was bobbled by the third baseman. Fink, who was running on contact, beat out the throw at home to give Bucknell the win. ""It was important for us to win these games today,"" said Szafranski. ""It will really give us some momen tum going into Patriot League play."" In the second game, Bucknell only needed three runs to beat State, and freshman Heather Hoehn '94 proved to be the catalyst. Early in the game she drove in Gessler, who had just tripled, with a hit up the middle. In the sixth Hoehn scored the winning run on a single by an other freshman, Mollie Laubauch off the third baseman's glove. For the game, Laubauch had the only mul tiple hit performance, going 2-for-3. Hoehn had reached base on a walk and moved into scoring position af ter advancing to second base on a wild pitch. Fink went the distance for Bucknell on the mound holding Penn State to just two runs on two hits in seven innings, earning her fourth win of the season. ""This is just a total team ef fort,"" said co-captain Jen Kalochie '91, who made an incredible diving catch in the first game. ""We're hit ting the ball well, playing solid de fense, and just have strong team unity out on the field. If we keep this up I'd like to think we could win it all."" Kalochie, who is currently tied for tenth in the nation averaging one RBI per contest, and the rest of Coach Dale Franquet's team will have a chance to prove themselves this weekend when they travel to Army and Fordham in two key doubleheaders in for the Patriot League standings. Army returns a strong nucleus from a very solid 29-10 team last year, including their top four hitters. Jackie Patten topped the Cadets in 1990 with 43 hits, while Julie Robert batted .353. Charlotte Tobin will also be returning, bringing her team leading 30 RBI from last year. Fordham, on the other hand should not be as competitive, as they fin ished last season with an 8-31 << - m Bucknellian File Photo Mollie Laubach '94 takes a pitch high while Jill Szafranski '93 leads off third base against Hofstra in a game played earlier this season."
"Tennis tops Lehigh, falls to Hens",
Bison to continue Patriot League play Monday against Lafayette,"By Scott Brown Staff Writer Entering perhaps the toughest week of the season to date, the men's tennis team needs to rebound after losing to Delaware while almost blowing a lead to Lehigh. The Bison played their last match Wednesday, in Delaware, and got off to a strong start in singles winning four of their six matches. Leading the way was number one singles, player Jerome Charlier '92, who won easily, 6-4, 6-1. Andrew Cantor '92 won 6-3,6-3, in an unac customed spot for him, the three spot. He moved up after winning all five of his matches of the season at the fourth spot. Scott Bank '91 won his sixth singles match of the season, 6-3,6-2 at number five while Chris Rimpel '93 came from behind, taking his opponent to the third set before winning, 6-7,6-1,6-4. Bruno Barbera '94 was de feated after being promoted to the second singles position, 6-3, 6-3. Cris Stcnstrom '94 went down, 6-3, 6 - 2 . From here things only got worse for Bucknell. All they needed to do was win one doubles match to ensure a victory for the team but they were swept. Charlier and Stenstrom lost a gruelling match 7-6, 7-6 as Barbera and Cantor were falling at number-two doubles 6-3,6-1. Only Bank and Greg Downing '94 were able to even battle into the third set, but they fell 6-4, 6-7, 6-2. The 5-4 loss moved the Bison's overall sea son record to 4-5. The men began the week at home in their first conference matchup of the season against Lehigh. Again they struck early, coming up strong in four of the six singles matches to take the early lead. Charlier had to battle a power ful serve by Ryan Gelrod, who was last year's ECC number one singles runner-up. After losing an early lead in the first set, it took him three sets before he was able to claim victory, 5-7,6-4,6-0. Barbera and Cantor also needed three sets for their wins at the number two and four singles, re spectively. Barbera won 6-1, 5-7, 6-4 while Cantor outlasted his op ponent, 5-7,6-3,6-1. Bank was also successful at the fifth spot with a straight set victory, 6-4,6-2. mm"
issiS,"Colin Bridgewater/The Bucknellian Jerome Charlier '92, seen here in last Saturday's number-one singles match against Lehigh's Ryan Gelrod, won in three sets, 5-7,6-4,6-0. Gelrod was the runner-up at last spring's ECC Championships. Stenstrom fell in two sets, 6-3, 6-2, while Rimpel, at number six, eventually lost in the third set, 4-6, 6-4,6-3. Again all Bucknell had to do was win one doubles match to ensure team victory and that is all they did. The number two duo of Cantor and Barbera was able to oulast Lehigh, 6-7 (8-6), 6-2, 6-4. Stenstrom and Charlier was defeated 6-4, 2-6, 6-4, while the third pair. Bank and Rimpel, fell 6-2, 6-3, leaving the score for the match 5-4 in favor of Bucknell. Bank commented on the char acter of the team's play this past week, ""The team is young and the Lehigh win proves that we are ma turing. However, the Delaware loss proves that we need work in being match tough and competing over the course of an entire season. We're basically encouraged by everyone's play and are looking for a winning streak in upcoming conference matches."" The team win did leave the Bison with a perfect 1-0 record in the Patriot League, which will be tested Monday when the team travels to Lafayette. Last year the Bison had no trouble defeating the Leopards but Lafayette returns five of their top six singles players from last year. The doubles team of Jason Giaquinto and Tom O' Connor lead the way after finishing as a runner- up in the 1990 ECC Championships. But first, the tennis squad must battle Rider tomorrow at home."

Kelly Marsh exemplifies student-athlete,
Senior history major continues Bucknel I's strong tradition by excelling in the,"' By Mitch Benton Staff Writer ""A day intended to focus at tention on the positive role that sports can have on the physical and mental development of young people."" That was how Senator Bill Bradley described Congress' newly declared National Student-Athlete Day, observed this past Saturday, April 6. Few student-athletes at Bucknell, as well as in the nation, exemplify this role better then Kelly Marsh '91. A 4.0 grade point aver age and conference championships mark the academic and athletic ca reer of Bucknell's 42nd GTE Aca demic All-American in the past ten years. This senior history major is the latest in a long line of Bucknellians who have excelled both on the play ing fields and in the classrooms. The school's total of 25 Academic All- Americans over the past five years ranks second in the nation, trailing only the University of Nebraska. Last year alone, four Bison scholar- athletes were honored, leaving Bucknell ranked third, behind Ne braska and Georgia. A valedictorian with a 4.0 GPA in high school. Marsh was named All-State in Pennsylvania three times for cross-country, twice for track and field and once for swimming. In choosing colleges, she was looking for a school in which the athletes were also stu dents, and had narrowed her choices to Princeton and Bucknell when she came to Lewisburg to visit. Marsh claims that she was so impressed by the track program and the academic atmosphere, that she never again considered Princeton. Apparently she is not disap pointed about her decision. ""I have no regrets about coming to Bucknell. I've been happy here and i've en joyed the Bucknell experience."" Entering college, Marsh had athletic goals that included qualifying for the Eastern Championships, but refused to set academic goals for fear of putting too much early pressure on herself. Unfortunately she was forced to wait longer than expected to ful fill her athletic goals. At the begin ning of her sophomore year, Marsh suffered a knee injury and was forced to undergo surgery, which kept her out of competition for most of the year. By her junior year, Marsh had regained her form and continued to lead both the Cross-Country and Track and Field Teams. During that year she won individual East Coast Conference Championships in the indoor two-mile and outdoor 5,000- meter runs, was runner-up in the in door three-mile and outdoor 10,000- meter, and placed eleventh in the 10,000 at the Eastern Champion ships. The year concluded with Marsh being named the ECC Scholar-Athlete in her sport as well as being selected to the GTE / CoSIDA (College Sports Informa tion Directors of America) Univer sity Division Academic All-America At-Large First Team. Bucknell and Marsh have continued their award-winning ways in the newly formed Patriot League. She joined soccer's Christina Baselga '91 and indoor track and field's Lynnette McBride '91 and Matt Deardorff '92 in being honored as top Patriot League Scholar-Ath letes. In this fall's cross-country season, the Bison's co-captain was the top Bucknell runner in all but one of the meets. She also led the squad as the Bison finished third in the Eastern Championships. It is in examining a typical day during that cross-country season, that one can truly appreciate the dedication that Marsh needed to achieve her success. Her day begins with breakfast at 8:00 a.m. in preparation for an early English class. After her morning classes are finished at 11:00, Marsh must head to the Freas-Rooke Pool. Her first year she would use this time for road running, but since her surgery, she is forced to do some of that running in the water. She would often skip lunch and use the time following this workout to do some studying before an afternoon class that ends at 2:30,"
Cycling team reorganizes,
with over fifty members,"By Lee Lefkowitz and Tim Peterson The Bucknell Cycling Club has experienced a new surge in membership and participation since its reorganization last year by Lee Lefkowitz '93. Since then, the club has strived to meet its three-pronged goals for providing a forum for any members of the campus interested in riding street bicycles, mountain bikes, or racing any kind of bike. To date, the club's growth has been slow but steady. The fifty or so recreational cyclists affiliated with the club can enjoy the camradcrie associated with riding together in a group. The next scheduled rides are slotted for this weekend, April 13 and 14, at 1:00 pm, and will leave from the downhill side of the Langone Center before meandering through the surrounding country side Sean Reid '94 and Laura Landsiedel '93 will be leading these rides, which will have a slow to moderate pace. The terrain is from flat to rolling, and the rides will cover close to 25 miles. As usual, riders are encouraged to wear hel mets and everyone is invited to join the fun. Aside from the recreational side of the Bucknell Cycling Club, there is also a three-man collegiate cycling team composed of Victor Tchiprout '92, Greg Tall '93, and Lefkowitz. Tchiprout, returning to the sport after a two-year break, is hoping to make a successful debut in Category C collegiate races. Tall, the other Category C collegiate racer, is off to a good start after having won the bike leg of Bucknell's Ironman Competition. Lefkowitz, Buckncll's only Cat egory A collegiate racer and winner of last year's West Branch Road Race, is hoping to repeat again this year, when the race will be held on May 11. When asked about this year's edition, Lefkowitz said, 'This year's race will be much tougher with the inclusion of a severe two-mile climb, the lengthening of the race to forty- eight miles, and the presence of a very powerful six-man team from Susquehanna University."" As the most experienced rider on the team, Lefkowitz is begining his sixth season of racing, having ridden on Mazda's Junior National Team in 1989,Gatorade-Michelin in 1990, and currently on the Fuji- Criterium USA Team based in Somerville, New Jersey. Having ridden on such highly organized teams, he sees some shortrnminps with Bucknell's pro gram: ""Basically, a team needs at least four riders to be effective--one climber, one sprinter, one time trialist, and one good all-around rider. Without that, it becomes much more difficult to compete success fully against some of the larger ten man squads that can exert near total control over a race."" This season, the collegiate race scene has been marred by race cancellations at West Point, the Na val Academy, and Columbia; how ever, the team has taken this setback well, and is planning to compete in the West Branch Road Race and the Eastern Collegiate Cycling Championsips at the University of Massachusetts. In addition to the road riders and racers, the Bucknell cycling Club offers the opportunity for the Courtesy of The Bucknell Cycling Team Lee Lefkowitz '93 crosses the Susquehanna River Bridge victorious."

For Marsh, these other interests include membership in the Kappa Kappa Gamma Soror ity.

After the race, Benson commented that ""the race was fun, but the bumps and hills challenged mv stamina."" Peterson began racing moun tain bikes in California this past summer and found the sport to be a fun alternative after three years of racing on the road. Having raced in the prestigious Big Bear Mountain bike series and the fall version of the WQWK challenge last year, Peterson brings a lot of experience to a young team that may very well dominate off-road racing in the Pennsylvania region within the next few years. So far everyone on the team is optimistic and getting ready for more races in Lancaster, West Chester, and Harrisburg. While mountain bike racing is not yet an established intercollegiate sport, Bucknell's team may be setting a new trend."
Equestrian team trots off,
to Penn State tomorrow,"By Brenda Rose The Bucknell equestrian team has come a long way since its humble beginnings. It beganas a club team three years ago, but did not begin competition until the fall sea son of 1990. The team had a solid season last year, though it was still building. But now, the team is at the point it envisioned when it began. Partici pation has increased significandy in the last year since the team has be gun to show. Because of this, there are many beginners, but this should serve to ensure the future of this sport for years to come. This past Sunday, Bucknell travelled to Wilson college in Chambersburg, Pa. for a horse show in which Bison riders competed on the individual and team level against eight other colleges from all over Pennsylvania. An intercollegiate horse show is run differendy than any other type of equestrian competition. The teams travel to host schools where they ride that facility's horses. The rider receives a horse by a lottery system and then competes in a divi sion based on his or her ability. Not only do the points a rider receives for Courtesy of The Bucknell Equestrian Team Kelly Kordish '92 and her horse jump a fence during last weekend's show at Penn State University. The team will return to Happy Valley tomorrow for another show before regionals next Saturday. his performance contribute to the team's score, but they also determine if a rider will advance to the regional show. The next step after regionals is zones, followed by nationals. The outcome of determined training all winter coupled with the competitive spirit of the Bucknell riders was a nine point victory over Penn State and Wilson, two of their largest rivals of the season. Jocelyn Perot '94 contributed significantly to Bucknell's finish as High Point Team by being named Reserve High Point Rider for the day. Kelly Kordish '92 and Karen Schulte '91 placed first and fourth, respectively, in the Open Division while Brenda Rose '94 and Julie Grammont '93 were both able to place second in the Novice division. Deborah Stumph '94 took sixth place in the same bracket. Cathy Rctallack '93 finished fourth in the Open division. The Bison dominated the Beginner Di visions as Becky Christie '93, Bev Shaw '91, Amy Clare '91 and Katie Kowalski '93 captured places one through four, respectively. Bucknell will travel fora show tomorrow at Penn State before regionals begin Sunday. This year several Bucknell riders have quali fied for regionals and others will hopefully compete in zones, to be held later this month."

The Bucknellian,
A preview of our nation's pastime,"By Scott Brown Staff Writer The leaves on the trees and the sun shining brightly can only mean one thing; class attendance will fall. And with it comes the beginning of our national pastime, baseball. Without any further ado, let's take a look at the American League: American I .yague Fast Last year the battle in this conference existed between the Boston Red Sox and the Toronto Blue Jays and this year will be no different The Jays only lost out to the Bosox last year by two games, but General Manager Pat Gillick more than made up for it this past off- season by picking up Devon White from the California Angels and making one of the biggest trades of the summer. He obtained second baseman Roberto Alomar and out fielder Joe Carter from the San Di ego Padres in exchange for first baseman Fred McGriff and shortstop Tony Fernandez. George Bell was also released. The addition of White, Alomar, and Carter gives the Jays speed, a commodity they have lacked. Also, without Bell and Fernandez, Toronto also has chem istry, something the team have been missing for quite a while. Along with steady pitching, some good young talent in Manny Lee and John Olrcud, and the coaching of Cito Gaston, this may be Toronto's year. Boston should give the Blue Jays a run for their money, but a couple of factors might keep them down. First of all, the loss of Mike Boddicker to the Kansas City Royals loses 17 games for them right off the bat. Secondly, although Jack Clark hit 25 home runs last year and will probably hit more in Fenway Park, his effect in the clubhouse may hurt the ball club. Helping the Bosox, will be a lineup that hit .272 last season. If the Red Sox pitching staff, led by the five million dollar man, Roger Clemens, can make up for the loss of Boddicker and match the staff of Toronto, they still have a shot. The division is significantly less competitive after that Baltimore looks like they have the most to offer and with youth may be a team of the future. They have helped them selves greatly by adding power hit ter Glenn Davis, who was more than happy to get out of Houston. Isn't everyone? He brings with him 22 home runs, but twice as many home runs are hit at Memorial Stadium than in the Astrodome. Dwight Evans also joins the club and his bat and experience can help the team. Lost is Mickey Tettleton in ex change for Jeff Robinson, a ten- game winner for the Tigers last sea son. If this team can stay healthy and pitchers Ben McDonald and Jeff Ballard can reach their potential this team could stay competitive. After that Detroit takes fourth, almost by default. Cecil Fielder who last year couldn't stay away from the long ball looks like the only thing he couldn't stay away from this sum mer was the dinner table. The Ti gers did get Rob Deer and Mickey Tettleton bringing them 42 more home to their already league-leading 172 last year. But the real story for the Ti gers is their pitching. They only re turn one starter with a record over .500, Dan Petry (10-9, 4.45 ERA). Their number one starter, Jack Morris, won 15 games last year but also lost 18. The only sure thing about this team is that the middle of the infield will be led by shortstop Alan Trammell and second baseman ""sweet"" Lou Whitaker, as it has been since 1977. The battle for the last three teams in the division will be as close as the baule for the first two spots, just not as interesting. Milwaukee should take the fifth spot, although the team did very liule to improve its condition in the off season. Look for manager Tom Trcbelhom to have an early exit from the 1991 season. The last two spots will be held by Cleveland and New York, re spectively. The Indians lost Joe Carter and Cory Synder and replaced him with their young prodigy Alex Cole. The Yankees have some big names-- Don Mattingly, Steve Sax, Mike Witt-- but they need some se rious output from Roberto Kelly, Kevin Maas, and a whole cast of others even to reach respectability. American Lpatmp Wwt With the acquisition of Tim Raines and Cory Synder, the only thing that can stop the Chicago White Sox from their first division championship since 1983 is for them to believe that they don't belong. People mention a jinx hitting Chi cago like the one Baltimore felt after its surprisingly good year two years ago but that should not be the case. Although young, Jack McDowell, Greg Hibbard, Melido Perez, and Alex Fernandez make a credible rotation. Young talent along with proven veterans throughout the lineup make this team tough to beat. And if Bo Jackson can get healthy, who knows what could happen? Obviously the team to beat, Oakland will still win 90 plus games, but not enough to take the division. Part of the problem may be the team's attitude, as players seem to be playing only for them selves and their pocketbook. They do have a potent lineup with a strong pitching staff. If the White Sox falter, the A's will be there to take their spot. Kansas City will bounce back from a sixth place finish in the division to take third, due in part to the acquisition of Boddicker and designated hitter Kirk Gibson. Also, Kansas City can never go wrong with George Brett and look for great things from Brian McRae. Fourth through sixth place will be a battle as all of these teams have a chance to stay over .500. Give the edge to Texas due to solid hitters Ruben Sierra, Julio Franco, and Rafael Palmiero. Their starting pitching should be pretty strong anchored by Nolan Ryan, Bobby Witt, and Kevin Brown. If baseball is mostly pitch ing, then California, even in fifth place, will still be very competi tive. Led by their rotation of Chuck Finley, Kirk McCaskill, Mark Langston, Jim Abbott, and Bert Blyleven this team will make up for its lack of hitting. Even though Seattle is picked sixth, it will still be a solid ballclub. The only reason Seattle is so low is because the AL West is the best division in baseball. The team is led by the 22 year-old phenom Ken Griffey Jr. Alvin Davis is still a threat. The twin towers of Erik Hanson (6-6) and Randy Johnson (6-10) combined for 32 of the team's 77 wins last year. Last in the division will be the Minnesota Twins. They did little over the summer to improve on a team that finished last in the division last year. Puckett is a pe rennial all-star but only Kent Hrbek could hit 20 homers last year. The young pitching staff has potential, but even itcan't drag the Twins out of the cellar."

743-5633,"By Chris Drowne Staff Writer The Senior Circuit has won three of the last five World Series, including last October's shellacking of the ""favorite."" We wont even discuss the All-Star game track records of the past decade or the beer softball Hall of Famers, I mean DH's, the Tigers and other teams have stockpiled in the other league. But, I digress into my predictions for the National League. National League Fact I'll start from the bottom and work my way up just for a change of pace. The St. Louis Cardinals will go through more golf balls than baseballs this season. This team is so bad that they've already made tee times for late August, knowing they'll be completely out of the race. Ozzie Smith will have to keep his fingers crossed for a trade before he runs out of gold gloves to polish or else die of boredom. Felix Jose has to ask himself whether or not playing everyday is worth being in S t Louis instead of Oakland. In all seriousness though, this team has some valuable arms such as Jose DeLeon, Ken Hill, and Lee Smith that some veteran teams might be willing to make ""fire sales"" for come crunch time. General Manager Del Maxwell might consider carry ing a cellular phone in his golf bag just in case. The Phillies have been trying to build a team around Von Hayes for the past what must seem like fifty years to Philadelphia fans. This guy isn't that good. Lenny Dykstra is an All-Star, but that's about it. The rest of this team is either past its prime or will never have one. John Kruk and Randy Ready are solid players. Mitch W illiams and Roger MacDowell just need the starters in front of them to give them a chance. The next four teams are all a notch above the aforementioned two and could be shuffled a variety of ways. The Montreal Expos have one of the most talented managers in all of baseball in Buck Rodgers, but just aren't deep enough, again, to win it all. The team posseses a little bit of everything, but not a lot of anything. The young arms and exciting line-up will give other teams trouble. Sophomores Walker, Grissom, and DeShields are explosive and should provide newly acquired Ivan Calderon, along with lifetime Expos Tim Wallach and Andres Gallaraga might just stay north of the border long enough to give Rodgers the ring he diserves, but not this year. ""We are fam ily"" wont be played in Pittsburgh as long as Barry ""Wa! I want more money"" Bonds is in die clubhouse. His best impres sion of Daryl Strawberry even forced the new Dodger to become bom again. However, Bond's sheer talent along with that of Bonilla, and Van Slyke should keep the team in contention offensively. Doug Drabek and Zane Smith offer Man ager Jim Leyland a steady ready- lefty, one-two punch in the starting rotation. The infielders will miss Sid Bream's glove at first as well as Wally Backman's versatility. Be sides, who's going to hit lead-off? The only reason I'm picking the Cubs for second is because I don't want their fans to have to suf fer through as post-season they know they can't win. This team is good enough and should win the di vision. Manager Don Zimmer will struggle with himself as to run or not run himself into and out of innings. This team is more like his Red Sox teams of the late I970's then his re cent Cub teams. Power hitters are up and down this line-up. George Bell, Andre Dawson, and Ryne Sandberg could drive in 95 or more runs a piece this year. Mark Grace and Shawon Dunston join Sandberg to form one of the better defensive in fields in baseball. Dave Smith should prevent Zimmer from getting those ulcers that Williams caused him last year as the teams ""closer."" The addition of starting pitcher Danny Jackson didn't come cheaply, but was worth it. If pitching is two-thirds of baseball then the Mets are a step up on the rest of the division. However, manager Bud Harrclson will develop a receding hairline watching Howard Johnson, Gregg Jefferies, and Dave Magadcn play infield. Only this staff could pitch through this woeful de fense. Young middle relievers Doug Simons and Jeff Innis are the keys to the division title. Dwight Gooden's arm is 100% for the first time in two years and should win the Cy Young Award. The batting order will have to put its errors behind it when it comes up to do its sole purpose, hit. The ""clubhouse cancer"" is gone to the left coast, which should steady the clubhouse a great deal. National League Wwt I didn't realize that they had decided where to put the new expan sion team. Houston, I guess, is a pretty safe bet. The other profes sional teams in the area, such as the University of Houston and the Houston Oilers have turned profits. This baseball team should have con sidered scheduling Stanford, Texas, and Arizona State instead of the Dodgers, Giants, and Reds. It's not even worth mentioning their per sonnel. Ted Turner should consider getting out of sports all together. The Goodwill Games have been a red ink nightmare. The Hawks might win more games this summer than the Braves, but I doubt it. This team is much improved however. The way Nick Esasky sees it, they have seven or eight potential All-Stars in Dave Justice, Terry Pendleton, and Sid Bream. If you have to be strong up the middle to win in this game, than the Braves are done. Steve Avery possesses the tools to be a great pitcher. Didn't we hear the same about Smoltz, Glavine, Lilliquist, and Pete Smith a few years ago? (I hope you realize I'm going backwards again.) The San Diego Padres will put people in the seats this season, unlike the football team with which they share Jack Murphy Stadium. Tony Gwynn, and Tony Fernandez are excellent baseball players. Fred McGriff should not see a single fastball in any kind of crucial situa tion because the players hitting be hind him can't damage a Spalding like he can. It's worth the price of admission to a Padre game just to listen to Benito Santiago pop mitts from over one hundred feet. He might throw harder than anybody on their pitching staff. The San Fransico Giants paid Bucknell bookstore prices for me diocre pitchers Dave Righetti and Bud Black. Roger Craig might as well put himself out on the hill and save the team some cash. It's a shame because this line-up is awe some, minus departed lead-off spe cialist Brett Butler. Will Clark, Kevin Mitchel, and Willie McGee strike unparalleled fear in the hearts of opposing pitchers. There are too many I's in Cincinatti for manager Lou Pinella to deal with. The babies of the midwest have their rings to suck on and will be content to do just that as they watch the Dodgers win the west. Jose Rijo's crying because he didn't start opening day is almost as ridiculous as Joe Oliver's and Jack ""Second-Half' Armstrong's walk outs. This team is far too loaded not to win. Tommy Lasorda will have fun with this team, especially if Orel Hershiser can take time out from his busy Pizza Hut and Johnson & Johnson commercials to rehab his shoulder and pitch. Jose Offerman will be talking to himself after his fourth error, but it doestn't matter because the pasta always tastes sweet when you win."

PURPQSFULLY on the 17th i,"i / Ahrens, Koemer, and Kennedy each had two RBI's. The Bison used different means to achieve another positive outcome in the nightcap. Kurt Waldner '93 pitched brilliantly holding Holy Cross to three runs on nine hits while going the distance to pick up his first win. Unlike the first game, Bucknell committed no errors to aid Waldner's effort. Bucknell tallied single runs in the first, third, fourth, and sixth while Holy Cross scored all three of their runs in the third inning. Ahrens had one of the Bison's RBI's when he singled home Kearns in the first. A Holy Cross error al lowed the run in the third, and Koemer drew a bases loaded walk to pick up an RBI in the fourth. The Bison scored the decisive run on an error in the sixth inning. Waldncr's outing was even more impressive because it was his first win since his pre-season shoulder injury and it demonstatcd that he has returned to the fine form he showed in last years campaign. The final game of the series wasn't quite so successful for the Bison. They were shut out on four hits as The Crusders cruised to an 8- 0 victory. Denis Maguire '93 picked up the loss, as he and a host of hurl- ers couldn't shut down Holy Cross. The brunt of the Crusaders' attack came when they picked up five in the fourth. The only bright spot for Bucknell was the play of first Kearns '93 opened the floodgates scoring his first of three runs. Third baseman Larry Trout '93 also con tributed driving home two more runs on a basehit. However, the Bison's lead was shortlived. Starter Mike Rizzi '91 suffered from control problems compounded by defensive errors to allow the Crusaders to score five runs in the first to take the lead. The one run lead was not enough to discourage the Bison's bats. However, a single run in the second and two more in the fourth put Bucknell up for good. The Holy Cross pitchers helped to dig their own grave with two walks to start the fourth inning rally. Second baseman Mike Koemer '92 then drove in one run with single, and catcher Mark Kennedy '92 followed that with a one-run double. The Bison never looked back. Bucknell tallied once in the sixth inning to keep the Crusaders at bay, and scored three in the seventh to ice an 11-7 victory. After the shaky first, Rizzi settled down to pitch effectively. He held Holy Cross scoreless through the fourth, and got help in the sixth from re liever Jack Kazanjian '93 to insure the Bison their eleventh victory. Rizzi got the win, his third, while Kazanjian picked up his first save. The Bison pounded out 12 hits in the game. Roger Ahrens '91 led the way with three, and Kearns, Koemer, and Trout each had two.

"Golf beats Lafayette,",
betters mark to 4-1,"By Chris Drowne Staff Writer With most of the golf world focusing on this weekend's Masters, Bison golfers concentrated on Lafayette, who defeated them in North Carolina two weeks earlier. Three Bucknejl golfers turned in season-best rounds to erase any il lusions of green sports blazers the Leopards might have had. The picture-perfect weather, a rarity for early-April golf in Lewis- burg, inspired Head Coach Tommy Thompson's men to ""maybe their best match in a couple of years."" But, Thompson believes revenge to be the real motive behind the victory. ""The guys all worked hard on their games this past week and they were confident and focused for this particular match since [Lafayette] had beaten us down in North Caro lina.""

Lax comes from behind for win,"By Eliza Wampler The women's lacrosse team defeated Georgetown 8-7 to capture their second win of the sea son, yesterday. The lacrosse ladies opened the first half of the game slowly, making basic mistakes on which Georgetown was able to capitalize. The Hoyas went into halftime with a 6-5 lead. HeadGoach Jennifer Averill commented, ""We were not playing consistently the whole length of the field. We did some nice things, but they came in spurts."" The second half, however, was an entirely differently game. The women were able to make great connections at midfield and suc cessfully shut down the Hoyas with strong defense in staging their comeback. Co-Captain Kristina Haas '91 remarked, ""I think that we matched up really well with Georgetown and were able to play a competitive and aggressive game."" Leading the way for the Bison was Dorie Lynn Ellwood '92, who tallied three goals to raise her team leading total to 17 for the season. Co-Captain Julie Goeller '91 con tributed two while Allison Arth '93, Leslie Why '92, and Jen Kehoe '94 each had one. Arth scored the game- winner with 2:20 left in the game. Kahra Foster '92 was excep tional in goal, making 13 saves while only allowing seven goals. She held Georgetown to only one goal in the second half. Last Saturday the team was defeated 20-7 by Patriot League ri val Lafayette in a game in which the score represented the Bison's level of play. The team was outmatched by a better Leopard squad. Assistant coach Ann Marie Larese noted,''You can not expect to win a game if you are playing de fense 70-80 percent of the time."" In the contest. Why sparked the attack with three goals and an assist. Ellwood added two more goals while Haas and Joann Talbot '91 each scored once. The Lady Bison will travel to Lehigh and Hofstra for a double header this weekend. Lehigh and Hofstra should both be tough, as they have a fast and aggressive style of play. The Engineers return ten letterwinners, including Caroline Kurz, who earned All-ECC honors last season. Also returning is goal keeper Gamil Hall, who recorded 225 saves in 17 games last year. It will be the team 's third Patriot League matchup of the season: they have split the first two. Peter Ho/The Bucknellian Dorie Lynn Ellwood '91 and Jennifer Kehoe '91 hound the Lafayette goalie in the Bison's 20-7 loss to their Patriot League rival. The Bison were able to rebound in their next contest with an 8-7 win over Georgetown. Ellwood leads the team with 17 goals, while Kenoe is second with 12."
Track continues outdoor season,"Colin Brldgewater/The Bucknellian Zack Vogel '93 is seen here hitting himself out of a sand trap. Led by Don Hansen '94 and his match-best 75, the Bison beat Lafayette, 392- 401. By Jamie Diaferia Staff Writer The Bison men's and women's track teams competed in the Colonial Relays at Williamsburg, Va. on Saturday and the First Annual Springtime Buck nell Invitational on Sunday. At the Colonial Relays, the Bison struggled to maintain some consistency in the various events. Mark Barolo '93 finished fourth in the men's 400 hurdles with a time of 54.93. In the men's college 4x100- Meter relay trials, Bucknell finished third with a time of 1:29.33. Finally, in the men's open hammer throw fi nals, co-captain Paul Austin '91 finished third and was an IC4A- qualifier. In the final day of the competition, the Bison finished fourth in the men's open 4 x 800 re lay classified finals. Jason Cahilly '92 finished third in the men's open 10,000-M, and qualified for the IC4A's. For the women, Bucknell finished third in the 4 x 100-mctcr relay Trials with a time of 48.76, for an ECAC qualifier. In the women's open 100 meter consolation finals, Tricia Plasko '92 finished second with a time of 12:41. In other action the Bison were largely erratic, finishing lower than sixth in most events. The team struggled to achieve some consis tency throughout the event, and, as a result, never reached their potential. At the Bucknell Invite, the Bison fared a little better as they finished respectably in several events. In the 3000m steeplechase, John Lewis '93 finished second with a time of 9:43.69. Judd Jarden '93 finished third for the Bison with a time of 9:47.85. In the hammer throw, Austin finished first with a throw of 52.59 meters. The nearest throw was more than five feet shorter.

Student escapes from rape,
attempt behind Roberts,"By Steve Hoerter Staff Writer An unidentified female stu dent was the victim of an attempted rape Sunday night on a pathway leading from Roberts Hall to the Gateways. The attack occurred at approximately 9:15 p.m. when an unidentified white male, dressed in black clothing, accosted the student, pushed her to the ground, struck her in the face and then attempted to re move her clothing. According to reports released by the Department of Security and Safety, the victim struggled, broke free from the assailant and ran to her residence room where she reported the incident to a friend. The friend, also an unidentified student, re ported the attack to the Office of Se curity and Safety, Sunday at ap proximately 10:04 p.m. Officers from Security con ducted a search of the entire campus but were unable to identify or locate any suspects. The victim, who re mains anonymous, has thus far re fused to be interviewed by either the Department of Security and Safety or area police authorities. This re fusal, according to Director Vincent DcCerchio, increases the difficulty of the investigation. A campus-wide Security Alert was issued Wednesday night by Se curity in an attempt to notify all stu dents of the possible danger that ex ists on campus. Flyers were posted Wednesday in residence halls and administrative and academic build ings. DeCerchio decided on Wednesday to ensure notification of all students by initiating an all-cam pus mailing. <<M R Colin Bridgewater/The Bucknellian A Bucknell student walks by the spot where an unidentified white male struck and attempted to rape a female Bucknell student last Sunday night. An investigation of the case is underway. In an interview Wednesday, Janice Butler, director of the Women's Resource Center, said, ""I think that this is an example of when the University is trying to walk a fine line by being sensitive to the victim and also alerting the student body."" She added, ""Security made every ef fort to offer assistance to the victim, but if women won't come forward, our hands arc tied as to what we can do."" Butler stressed the need for victims to come forward as soon as possible so that the appropriate au thorities have a better chance of ap prehending the assailants. ""Unless we get reports about this, we can't take steps to prevent this from hap pening. I encourage all women to inform someone in the Women's Resource Center, Psychological Ser vices or Security,"" Butler said. Barry Maxwell, vice president for administration, discussing the timeliness of the Security Alert, said that the decision was ""a judgement call by the people involved."" DeCerchio said the delay in issuing the Alert was due to a lack of infor mation on the actual incident. ""I just couldn't accept information from a third-hand source as correct,"" DeCerchio said. According to DeCerchio, the victim was unwilling to release de tails on the assault until she con tacted Butler Monday night Butler said that a draft of the Alert was cir culated for comment Tuesday morn ing to herself, Barry Maxwell, John Dunlop and Mike Amarante. Fol- lowing this circulation, DeCerchio issued the Alert Wednesday night.

Two visitors attacked,
and seriously injured,"By Steve Hoerter Staff Writer Michael Riddick '91 was ar rested and arraigned yesterday on charges in connection with an al leged assault that took place early Saturday morning in front of Malesardi Hall. According to a criminal complaint released yes terday afternoon by District Jus tice Leo Armbruster, Riddick al legedly assaulted two men who performed in the Langone Center Friday night. According to Mary Dorsey, acting associate dean for orienta tion and activities, the men were disc jockeys hired by Bison Pro gramming to perform in the Bison. The men, Daphnis Espinar and Elias Ladopoulos, both 21 and residents of New York City, were attending a party in Malesardi Hall following the performance late Friday night when Riddick alleg edly accused one of them of at tempting to steal a pair of sun glasses. The two men, joined by their friends Yehidie Novoa, 19 of New York City, and Jean Simon '94, left Riddick's residence room and were attempting to leave the area when they were allegedly as saulted by Riddick and an uniden tified male. According to the report and statements from witnesses, Riddick and the unidentified male hit Espinar, causing him to fall facedown on the ground. Ladopoulos, as he was attempting to help Espinar, was then allegedly punched in the head by Riddick. Riddick then allegedly attempted to punch Novoa, who fled the scene. Espinar, Ladopoulos and Simon then left the scene and phoned campus security from Smith Hall. Security responded and, upon arrival, summoned the Lewisburg Police Department and an ambulance. Following interviews with police, the victims positively iden tified Riddick as one of the men in volved in the assault. Espinar suffered a broken jaw and Ladopoulos suffered a bro ken right ear drum. Both were treated and released from Evan gelical Hospital and will seek fur ther medical attention in New York. Riddick was arraigned and charged yesterday with aggravated assault (first degree felony), simple assault, recklessly endangering an other person, criminal attempt (all second degree misdemeanors) and harassment and disorderly conduct (both summary offenses). In an interview last night, Dean of Students John Dunlop said that the University is still consider ing what action, if any, the Univer sity will take. ,"

Take Back the Night,
march,
speaks out against rape,"By Andrew Cohen Staff Writer Yesterday's Take Back the Night march took on added meaning in light of the attempted rape behind Roberts Hall last Sunday. In an event whose significance and emo tion transcended words, rape survi vors and those close to survivors re lived their pain as well as their ef forts to recover. Take Back the Night is a na tionwide event that is run in conjunc tion with National Sexual Aware ness Month and National Victims' Rights Week. At 10:30 p.m. people began to gather in Rooke Chapel where by the end of the night there were over 100 people in attendance. At 11 p.m. the event formally began with a speak- out where people shared their sto ries, read poetry, and discussed the societal problems that underlie rape. Ima McArdlc, director of Susquehanna Valley Women in Transition which co-sponsored the march, asked that those who spoke not be quoted or named in the press, or elsewhere. The speak-out was followed by a Candlelight Vigil and then the march itself which took the partici pants all over campus. Feminist Outreach co-spon sored the event which was overseen by Amy Durgan '93 and Jill Myrom"
GR.,"Myrom explained the purpose of the march stating, 'The night is not a safe time for women, we're try- ing to end this cycle of fear and vio lence."" Myrom stressed that it is not only rape survivors who benefit from the march, but all women be cause of the fear of rape that is a re ality today. ""It's part of the fear too, women who have never been raped go to the march and get just as much out of it."" One thing Myrom hopes people realize is that any woman in the audience could very easily have been in the place of a survivor. She said that when she hears the stories she thinks of times when she has been in the same situation. ""It brings it home to everyone that they could be involved, it could easily have been them.""

"MARCH,","page 2 Bucknellian File Photo Those victimized by rape as well as those close to survivors of rape gathered at last year's Take Back the Night march. This year's march attracted over one hundred participants. i By Tara Gilligan Staff Writer Once a remote, overlooked is sue, occasionally the cause for lib eral demonstrations, Earth Day has blossomed into a wide acknowledg ment of man's need to save his envi ronment. A variety of speakers, mu sicians and students at informational booths will celebrate Earth Day to morrow along with the Bucknell and Lewisburg communities. The Earth Day Planning Committee, respon sible for Saturday's activities, will donate all proceeds to the Chesa peake Bay Foundation. The Earth Day celebrations will begin at 11:00 a.m. on Swartz field with an opening prayer, fol lowed by introductions by President Gary Sojka, Lee Idleman, chairman of the Board of Trustees, and two students. Throughout the day three keynote speakers will address envi ronmental issues. According to committee mem ber Steve Leshinski '91, the day's celebration will serve three pur poses: ""celebration, awareness, and action."" He said, ""You want to be come aware of what is going on and what you can do about it."" In addi tion to speakers, student groups will take part in the Earth Day celebra tion by sponsoring alternative activi ties. These activities include a kite flying contest, a tree hug, and a scav enger hunt for children in the Sun flower Nursery. Musical acts will follow all three speeches. The plan ning committee will serve free veg etarian chili to anyone who brings a bowl and utensils. Approximately 50 campus and local organizations will work the in formational booths which will present relevant environmental con cerns. Segments of the University's curriculum will be represented at these booths. One group of manage ment students will present a display, while engineering students will dis play a solar powered motor, accord ing to Melanie Bengston, assistant professor of civil engineering. Although Leshinski claims Earth Day to be devoid of politics, several petitions will be circulated. Clyde Peeling, coordinating director of Organizations United for the En vironment, will briefly address the crowd to point out the harmful af fects of a proposal hazardous waste incinerator on the area. A petition to oppose the building of the incinera tor will be located at one of the booths. Also, Leshinski spoke of a petition to request that courses on peace be taught at the University, just as military history courses arc taught to ROTC students. Prayer will be incorporated into the day's festivities, but the prayers will not exclude any de nomination. ""I imagine these are prayers that transcend our religious differences in a common cause for the future of the planet,"" said Mary Evelyn Tucker, adviser of the plan- See EARTH DAY, page 2 Bucknellian File Photo Two young boys enjoy the festivities at last year's celebration of Earth Day.

Flasher confronts,
fem ale student,"By Bob Minnich Staff Writer An unidentified male ex posed himself to a female Buck- nell student jogging in East Buf falo Township late afternoon Monday April 8. Another Buck- nell student reported the incident to security shortly afterwards. The female student was be side the Lcwisburg Area Joint Sewer Authority entrance along River Road when the unidentified male approached and dropped his pants. The victim ran and caught up with a male Buckncll student also running along River Road and told him about the occurrence. The event happened at approximately 3:45 p.m. and was reported to se curity 30 minutes later. Names of the two students arc being withheld. The victim described the man as being in his fifties, with a ^grey T-shirt, and driving a grey Plymouth station wagon. Bucknell security Sgt. James Middleton went to the scene and observed the described male. After seeing Middleton, the man drove away at high speed. Middleton stated that there was a discrepancy in the victim's description. He viewed the same vehicle as the male Bucknell stu dent who reported the crime, but Middleton described the driver as younger than 50. East Buffalo Township Pa trolman Harold Herman inter viewed both students, and the in vestigation is continuing. Vince DeCerchio, director of security and safety, stated that he has instituted additional patrols in that area. ""We've issued a number of warnings about jogging alone in the outer rural areas of campus,"" said DeCerchio. ""There are ample areas to jog that arc safer. If people want to jog in these outer areas, they should jog in pairs."""
Earth Day,
Rape,"From page 1 was not given a copy of the Alert Weddle attributed the proce dural error to the fact the DeCerchio is new and stressed the importance of ""articulating proper procedures to new staff."" Weddle explained that stan dard procedure requires any office wishing to issuing an Alert, whether it be health or security related, should contact the Office of Student Life immediately. Weddle said that as soon as the information has been verified, Student Life sends the Alert via Resident Assistants and campus wide mailings. Maxwell, addressing the Alert in an interview Wednesday, said, ""...the downside [in issuing an Alert prematurely] is that it heightens fears and anxieties. On the other hand, the community needs to know that this presents a threat to safety."" Maxwell said that Security and Safety's deci sion to issue a report is made in con sultation with ""the president, student life and myself."" DeCerchio said, ""Students need to be aware that dangers do ex ist on campus, and they need to take the appropriate precautionary mea sures so that something of this na ture does not happen again.""

Tucker will present a sermon entitled ""Sensitivity to Environment, Caring for the Earth"" at the 11 a.m. service in Rooke Chapel. According to Leshinski, Earth Day, though not favoring any par ticular religious doctrine, is naturally a spiritual event. ""I would say it's spiritual. It's a very spiritual day be cause I think that the problem we're addressing is spiritual,"" he said. Leshinski said that human beings have to look at their relationship with Earth ""and the way the Earth is going to respond to us. Because it's Earth Day it has to be spiritual,"" he said. Tucker sees a problem with the way religions deal with ecologi cal issues. ""The world religions up to this point have not concerned themselves with environmental eth ics.

For the final keynote address, Steve S tamos, professor of interna tional relations, will speak of the en vironmental issues surrounding the Persian Gulf War. ""His speech will be a political discussion, but not a political state ment. It's one thing to disagree with a person's political discussion but it's really alienating to disagree with someone's political statement,"" said Leshinski, reasserting that Earth Day does not center around political is sues. Leon Shenandoah, head chief of the Iroquois Nation will present, at the close of the events, a ""prayer for sunset"" At 8 p.m. he and Denise Waterman, records keeper of the Iroquois Nationals, will present ""The Haudenosaunce (Iroquois) and Mother Earth,"" a presentation spon sored by Chi Phi. The Earth Day Planning Com mittee plans to donate all of its prof its to the Chesapeake Bay Founda tion. According to Marcia Hershberger '92, committee trea surer, the group chose that particular fund because of its close link to Bucknell. Waste deposits from the University empty into the Susquehanna which feeds into the Chesapeake Bay, she said. Tee-shirt sales will account for much of the money. In addition, each organization paid $10 to set up a booth. A small part of that money went towards production costs, but the remainder will go to the Chesa peake Bay Foundation, according to Hershberger. From page 1 Durgan echoed Myrom's sen timents, and added that most people fail to realize the pervasiveness of rape's effects. ""Rape affects every one, it's not just women. Because at some time in your life you will ei ther be a survivor, or be close to a survivor, or love a survivor and want to get closer to that person but your relationship will be hindered be cause of a past act of violence..."" Last night's activities were preceded by a movie at 4 p.m. en titled Rethinking Rape. The film re ported that one in three women will be sexually assaulted before they die. It discussed the impact that rape has on the victim and those close to the victim. It also described that the charicature of a rapist ""is not some type of a pervert, but it can be any one."" One man in the movie ex plained that ""we all have the poten tial... you have to stop and think 'what am I doing?""' One important point made throughout the day's activities was that rape affects everyone, and that no one is immune. Durgan ex plained, ""I think this is important for people at Bucknell to participate to night because rape and sexual as sault happen at this campus far too often."" This past weekend serves as a chilling reminder for those who think that the pleasant confines of campus will shield them from the horrors of society."

Speaker stresses need,
for Holocaust education,
"Prosecutor of Nazi ""Ivan the Terrible, ""remembers victims of Holocaust","By Darren Millman and Cindy Levinson Staff Writers Following a short service Tuesday evening to commemorate Yom Hashoah, the Hebrew day to remember the atrocities of the Holo caust, internationally known author apd former head of the Justice Department's Office of Special In vestigations (OSI), Allan A. Ryan Jr., addressed the importance of con tinued Holocaust education. In his succinct and moving speech Ryan stated, ""I believe the Holocaust is relevant for as long as men and women live on this planet, because it contains a lesson that we can never afford to forget. When hatred and bigotry combine with po litical power and technology in a world of. indifference and timidity, then the most defenseless among us will be victimized in the crudest ways, and the consequences of that cruelty will have no end."" Ryan emphasized that without Holocaust education, ""revisionism,"" loosely defined as the belief that the events of the Holocaust were fabri cated, would become increasingly difficult to discredit in generations to come. He explained that such anti- Semitic ideologies are too ludicrous to warrant debate, but that it is es sential to prove them wrong through perpetual discussion of the historical facts. As a non-Jew, Ryan strongly cautioned other non-Jews against viewing the Holocaust as solely a Jewish concern. To ensure that a similar mass genocide never again occurs, he continued, the Holocaust must be everyone's concern. While with OSI from 1980 to 1983, Ryan spearheaded the United States' efforts to expose and pros ecute Nazi war criminals still living in the country. Most notably, Ryan orches trated the much-publicized 1981 in vestigation and subsequent deporta tion of John Dcmanjuk. Following his deportation to Israel, Demanjuk was later convicted and identified as the infamous ""Ivan the Terrible,"" the man credited with turning on the gas chambers at the Treblinka death camp. Although the Demanjuk case is still the subject of much contro versy, Ryan quickly refuted all claims of false identification ex claiming, ""I assure you as someone who has been intimately involved in that case for a decade, there is no doubt that the evidence is valid and overwhelming and that the man is guilty."" In a historical context, Ryan spoke of the anti-Semitic practices of Congress which allowed an esti mated 10,000 Nazi war criminals to gain asylum in this country. As a direct result of the Displaced Per sons Act of 1948, citizens of those nations which had close tics to the Nazi's during World War II easily gained admittance into the United States, while European Jews had much more difficulty. ""More than seven out of ten visas by law had to go to those groups where the extent of collabo ration with the Nazi's was among the highest in Europe,"" said Ryan. It was not until 30 years later that Congress officially recognized the error of its"
Concert committee sponsors,
Earth Day musical performers,"By Timothy W. Kirk Staff Writer The concert committee will be sponsoring two upcoming events with the $18,000 remaining in its budget for the 1990-91 fiscal year. Derek Shields '92, concert commit tee chairperson, gives an optimistic account of the financial and opera tional progress of the committee this year. BSG has allotted $10,000 for musical entertainment during Earth Day festivities tomorrow, and Shields believes the committee got the most for its money by booking entertainment in four afternoon slots. Though rumors circulated that the Indigo Girls would be scheduled for this Saturday's event, Shields notes that the $10,000 was insuffi cient to entice a band of that caliber. Instead there will be a combination of acoustic, classic, and even inter- prctational painting to music this weekend, and Shields describes all the artists as ""extremely talented."" Shields points out that losses sustained from last semester's Little Feat concert were $10,000 less than those from the Squeeze concert held at Davis Gym a year ago. He views the committee's ac tions this year as a definite success, noting that he was contacted by Little Feat after its concert and was told by a band member that ""it was one of the best college gigs they'd played in years."" Now that the concert commit tee reports directly to the BSG ap propriations committee, there will exist a ""tighter rein"" on finances, and D ana Plasse/The Bucknellian Concert committee chairperson Derek Shields '92, is pleased with the talent the committee has attracted for the Earth Day festivities, as well as the signing of New Rhythm and Blues Quartet (NRBQ). this should better serve to decrease further losses. ""Few people realize the plan ning involved in a major college concert,"" says Shields. Accommo dations for the band, their roadies, security concerns, and a host of pa perwork are all behind-the-scenes responsibilities which accompany such obvious tasks as booking and paying the band. Shields notes the"

Campus facility stores,
hazardous materials,"By Bob Ritter Staff Writer Ever wonder about the small, high-tech looking compound behind the Structural Testing Lab, with the alarms and flashing lights? The fa cility, the University's hazardous materials storage area, is the result of five years of planning and con struction, and is the most visible cle ment of a comprehensive plan to deal with hazardous materials used throughout the campus. According to Director of Safety Jim McCormick, the $70,000 facility represents the culmination of ""five years of planning, construction and budget requests."" The result is a facility which, McCormick said, ""is designed to serve our needs well into the future, and satisfies the needs of local, state and federal regulations for years to come."" The facility stores both mate rials delivered to campus, and waste materials waiting to be picked up for disposal. McCormick explained that ""hazardous materials are in use in a variety of areas on campus,"" includ ing solvents and other chemicals used in the chemistry, chemical en gineering and biology departments, inks and paints used in the art depart ment, engine cleaning solvents used by the physical plant, and custodial products used across campus. ""In just these areas alone, there is a huge waste stream,"" he explained. From the storage area the waste is picked up by licensed haul ers and transported to disposal sites along the East coast. The newest ad dition to the storage area is the con tainer for storage of incoming mate rials, used mostly for chemisty. Along with the storage containers, McCormick explained that the facil ity is equipped with ""all kinds of spe cial features to tell if a problem oc-"

All of these detection systems are con nected to the Office of Security and Safety, which can contact off-cam pus agencies as needed in ""a multi- step process,"" including a Hazardous Materials Response team at the White Deer Fire Company in New Columbia. Should a problem arise, McCormick noted that ""we have an unbelievable number of off-campus agencies"" ready to assist. The safety measures for chemical storage have been built into the new science complex, with ""a special set of rooms for hazard ous material"" in the basement of the Chemistry Building, designed to handle the needs of that building and the new Biology Building. In addi tion, the completed Biology Build ing will contain a storage area for low-level radioactive materials used in the department. McCormick said that the de sign requirements for the two rooms (one each for incoming and outgo ing materials) cost $20,000 before construction even began, due to the careful attention given to ""the tre mendous amount of requirements"" found in local, state and federal regu lations. He explained that the small amounts of low-level radioactive materials used in biology labs arc taken by a licensed hauler and dis posed at the Federal Nuclear Waste disposal facility in Hanford, WA. In addition, all medical and infectious waste from the department is col lected and incinerated. The storage program is one el ement in Buckncll's comprehensive program for laboratory safety, which includes informing students and fac ulty of risks and safety procedures. The program has been very successful according to McCormick who said, ""Very few injuries have been sustained by students working in labs as a result of programs we ini tiated."" McCormick feels the most im portant role for members of the Uni versity community in the hazardous materials program is ""to be aware we are aware of our duties and responsi bilities with hazardous materials. [The program] makes Buckncll a much safer place to teach and lcam."""

Relief effort fails,
to aid Kurds,"Refugees are continuing to die in large numbers, despite the large- scale rescue campaign by the United States military. Even though it is not operating to its fullest capability yet, the relief effort, which began last week, has shown no signs of revers ing the deteriorating condition among the Kurds. If anything, the refugees' plight seems to have wors ened. The basic problem in the relief effort is that supplies cannot be car ried overland to the mountain passes, beyond the reach of tracks unable to navigate roads of thick mud, where the Kurds are camped. Pouring in from around the world, the supplies are available, but they cannot get where they need to go. Meanwhile, Turkish officials are encouraging the Kurds to return home. Turkey is still a developing country, and the Kurdish-dominated Southeast is the poorest region in the country, additionally plagued by guerilla insurgency and tight mili tary security. They are unsure of how many more people they can al low to enter their country. However, refugees refuse to go back as long as Saddam Hussein remains in control of Iraq. The American military will continue to carry food, water, and other material on heavy-load heli copters while trying to persuade the Kurds to come down from the moun tains and resettle on more accessible terrain where supplies can be made available."
Honda changes,
sluggish image,"Nobuhiko Kawamoto, presi dent of Honda Motor Company and key member of the corporation's tri umvirate, has reported many con cerns since he was elected last June into his official position. Honda, the 1980's most successful automaker, has now slowed in sales, maintains Kawamoto, and hope for the future will be contingent upon the hierar chy of the company. From Honda's beginnings in 1948, the company established itself as one of the most ""demo cratic"" automakers in the world. Meetings were held daily to discuss important production and sales factors, and integral decisions were usually made by an average of twenty to thirty executives. Kawamoto has publicly claimed that this approach will simply not work any longer, as Honda is now reaching out to other markets, and the company can no longer afford to be ""conservative and sluggish."" The cars which are being pro duced are of less interest to Ameri can buyers; the sports car has practi cally overtaken the automobile mar ket. Therefore, Kawamoto believes that the time has come for a more efficient method o f making deci sions; specifically, a ""kyowa set,"" or, "" republican system."" This is a major adjustment for such a large company to adhere to, but Kawamoto and two other top ex ecutives, Shoichiro Irimajiri and Yoshihide Munkekuni, are confident that they are steering Honda in the right direction."
Tight recession,
hits Europe,"After the destruction of the Berlin wall, Europe planned to have a spectacular boost in its economy, with the unified Germany at the helm. However, Europe is now fall ing into a tight recession, spurred by the war in the G ulf and the problems which have arisen in the Middle East. Last year when the United States was in a recession of its own, Europe experienced what is now re ferred to as ""Europhoria,"" believing that Europe would surpass all other countries and hold the reins over the world' s economy. Instead, the buzzword has now changed to "" Eurorealism,"" as the countries in volved are forced to confront the possibility of economic failure. The country presently in the worst state is Great Britain and it, subsequently, is the cause of the sud den inflation. Due to the 'Thatcher boom"" in the 1980's, the country fell into a slump last spring and is not expected to pick itself up for sev eral months. Karl-Otto Pohl, the president of Germany's Bundesbank, has as serted that a slow, cautious move to ward economic stability is the best route to take. Many others agree with him, although several members of the European Community believe the recession to be quite temporary and expect the chaotic state of the economy to bounce back in a short time."

The United States was weary of this plan, as officials asserted that South Africa would receive no posi tive action from the U .S. until all five conditions which must be completed to remove the sanctions are enacted; namely, repealing state-of-emer- gency regulations, legalizing once- banned opposition political parties, entering negotiations with represen tative political groups, freeing all political prisoners, and repealing laws that classify people by race. Although Pretoria has complied with three o f these regulations, Congress is still not ready to follow the lead of the European Community. The world-wide opinion on this move consists of hesitant sup port While many feel that the Euro pean Community has correctly re warded South Africa for complying with most of the sanctions, others arc unsure of the exact implications of the bold new action. The European nations, however, feel quite confi dent and are willing to stand by their decision."
lUDs safer than,
once believed,"A  recent study published by Dr. Richard Kronman and his asso ciates asserts that the past informa tion regarding the safety of IUDs has been incorrect. His new findings have uncovered that although IU D 's are not the most desirable contraceptievs (they are chosen by 3% o f women today, less than half the number in 1982), they are cer tainly not as dangerous as they were once believed to be. Kronman specifically cites the Daikon Shield incident dating back to the 1970's. The Women's Health Study, published in 1981, was one of the biggest upsets in that case, and Kronman now states that their findings were inconclusive and poorly conducted. Kronman further claims that their previous finding were very sub jective, especially with all the nega tive media surrounding the Daikon Shield incident which occurred si multaneously with the study. The American College of Ob- stetricians and Gynecologists are praising Kronman and declaring that his is probably the most well-in formed and solid piece of work on intrauterine devices which has yet been conducted. Although the study does not find IUDs to be completely free from causing internal problems, Kronman concludes that this could be due to the user and not the prod uct. However, a debate will surely arise from the two conflicting stud ies, and the millions of women who have been negatively affected by the contraceptives. Additionally, it is interesting to note other countries' contracep tive preferences; in China, 40% of all women use IUDs, and 21% of all Scandinavian women choose this form of pregnancy prevention. The most controversial issue surrounding the IUD  is the simple fact that although it has been proven to work effectively, scientists cannot explain why it works. If this knowl edge were brought to light, perhaps future studies could be less contro versial and more conclusive."
Court to review,
college bias,"The Supreme Court will soon be hearing a case centered around the subject of bias on college and university campuses. Mississippi, one of the top state-wide ""violators"" of segregation in higher education, agrees that the majority of schools which were attended mainly by those of one race in the 1960's are still following that same pattern. However, state officials assert that due to the influence o f "" tradition,"" it is very difficult for them to regulate the entrance of minorities. The major problem arises when the same segregation laws which apply to elementary and sec ondary schools are applied to higher- level schools of education, because the enrollment at these institutions is not mandatory. The Mississippi case has been in Federal Court since 1975, al though the appeal is relatively new. The previous decision resulted in a vote of nine to four in favor of the state."
Honor Investiga,
tion Continues,"The Honor Commission at Gettysburg College is continuing its investigation o f the Honor Code with a survey to be distributed to certain classes this week. Fearful that students would throw the surveys into the nearest recycling bins from their mailboxes, the Honor Commission asked fac ulty to set aside some time during classes next week for students to fill out the surveys. Faculty have also been asked to fill out the report. Gettysburg's Commission is hoping that as many students as pos sible will fill out the survey, so they can put an end to the Honor Code investigation and find a solution soon. -- The Gettysburgian"
Private college,
tuition increases,"Tuition is rising in many pri vate colleges across the country, causing great concern to current and future college students. On March 15, all Denison parents received a letter outlining an 8.3% tuition in crease for the 1991-92 academic year. This means that tuition and fees w ill rise to $14,700 from $13,510, while room and board will change from $3,740 to $3,980. The main reason for this rise in tuition is an increase in the sala ries and benefits for faculty and staff. Denison remains in the bottom third of fifteen other institutions similar in structure when comparing profes sors' salaries. Their total revenue now places 60% for salaries, 20% for financial aid, and the remaining 20% for significant increases in costs for health care, utilities, and postage. There have also been several cutbacks in administrative areas at Denison to upgrade professor sala ries. University officials promise that financial aid will not be jeopar dized by the increase. President Myers explained that if the institu tion did not provide financial aid, there would be no need for an in crease. However, she, as well as other officials, worry that Denison will become a school for the rich. Myers knows that sacrifices must be made for students to attend their col lege, but feels the outcome is well worth the price. -- The Denisonian"
MA law requires,
crime reports,"A  law requiring all public and private institutions in Massachusetts to submit annual reports o f campus crimes to the state department of public safety, took effect March 29. Massachusetts is one of twelve states that have enacted such laws throughout the nationwide contro versy about access to information on crimes occurring in colleges. The law, which was passed in December by the Massachusetts State House, requires that the infor mation contained in the reports be made available upon request to stu dents, applicants, and employees. The schools must also provide a de scription of their security forces and policies. The federal government has passed a similar law which will take effect in September. The Massachusetts law be came effective only two weeks after the former editor of the Southwest Missouri State University's student newspaper editor, Traci Bauer, sued the university after the paper was re fused access to crime reports. The administration at SM SU  said the Family Educational Rights and Pri vacy Act (FERPA) which protects student educational records, barred them from releasing information on student crimes, and that they would be denied federal funding if they re leased the information. U .S. District Judge Russel Clark ruled that Bauer had a right to the crime records of SM SU under Missouri's Sunshine Law (an open records law) and that the FERPA does not apply to campus police and security records. Clark also ruled that by refusing to re lease the information, SM SU vio lated the First and Fifth Amend ments to the Constitution. --The Amherst Student"

BYOB Trial,
ROTC threatens,
Scheduled at BU to expel cadet,"The In ter-fraternity Council voted unanimously to conduct a trial o f Bring Your Own Beverage (B .Y .O .B .) policy during Parent's Weekend (April 26 and 27). In ac cordance with the policy,.fraternity houses will not provide alcoholic beverages, but guests will be al lowed to bring six 12 oz. cans of beer to designated fraternity parties. In exchange, guests will receive tickets which can be exchanged for beer, one at a time. The IFC stressed that individual fraternities are not re sponsible for reimbursing guests for any beers not consumed. The purpose of the trial week end is to test these party procedures and to give the campus a chance to experience B .Y .O .B . before it be comes fully implemented next se mester, according to the IFC. A gay cadet has been threat ened with expulsion from the ROTC program at Washington University because he has admitted to being a homosexual. Robert Schwitz, who claims that he did not realize he was gay when entering the school, has been notified that the Air Force may seek a refund of the more than $45,000 in ROTC scholarship money he has re ceived. Last year James Holobaugh, another gay Washington University cadet, was expelled from the Army RO TC program. -- NSNS All International and National News Briefs are precis of New York Times articles.

Symposium honors geology,
professor Richard Nickelsen,"By Elizabeth Danneberg Staff Writer Dr. Richard Nickelsen of the geology department has recently been honored the Nickelsen Sympo sium on Thrust-Belt Structure and Tectonics, held on March 15 and 16 in Baltimore, MD. The symposium, organized by a former student and a colleague o f Nickelsen, consisted of a colloquium, a banquet, and the pre sentation o f a prize. In the colloquium, forty geologists work ing in the Appalachian Mountains read their papers, which required four different sessions. The banquet was held on one of the evenings and attended by sixty people, including several of Nickelsen's former professors. The presentation of an annual Nickelson Prize will be accompanied by a still- to-bc-dctcrmincd sum of money to the best student with a geology ma jor. The creation of the annual award was a "" surprise to me,"" Nickelson staled. Forty Bucknell graduates contributed to the prize. Professor Nickelsen, a struc tural geologist, came to Bucknell in 1959 after having received a Ph.D. at Johns Hopkins University and teaching at Penn State for six years."

Para selected for prestigious,
summer conducting programs,"By Julie L . Shurilla Staff Writer Christopher Para, assistant professor of music and conductor of the Bucknell University Orches tra, has been selected to participate in two prestigious conducting workshops this summer. One is the Aspen Conducting Program in New York, which lasts from the middle of June to the end o f Au gust The other, which takes place in early June, is the Boulez Inter national Conducting Workshop, a master class in conducting. The Aspen Conducting Pro gram is part of the Aspen School of Music, ""arguably the largest and most prestigious of the summer programs in music,"" according to Para. World famous musicians, including Itzhak Perlman, have taught there. Para will be in a class of nine conducting students, cho sen out o f approximately 160 people who were invited to audi tion after submitting an application and a videotape of their conduct ing. The audition consisted of ""ear training exercises and musical test ing, such as score reading and pitch identification,"" Para said, as well as a live conducting audition. Murray Siddlin will be in charge of the pro gram, and throughout the workshop, the class will be taught by several well-known guest conductors. Most of the conductors who participate in the Aspen workshop are professional conductors or stu dents o f conducting at music schools, rather than professors. Para, who has his master's degree in music from the Eastman School of Music, is the only member of the class who conducts in a strictly aca demic setting. However, he has also worked as a professional conductor for various groups, including the Genesee Symphony in New York, before coming to Bucknell. Para is also the first faculty member in recent history to be se lected to attend either o f these work shops. He pointed out that there is a large difference between profes sional conductors and educators, but, he said, "" I am hoping to end up in a situation at Bucknell where I can do both."" Para hopes to gain both artis tic experience and professional contacts at Aspen. ""I will have the experience of world class musi cians guiding me,"" he said. "" Con ducting is as much an art as it is a craft, and it will help to have input from several successful people."" Being invited to participate in the Boulez program is also a great honor for Para. He described Pierre Boulez, the conductor who is running the workshop, as "" a ge nius of twentieth century music."" "" A  lot of conductors fake their way through a twentieth century piece,"" Para said, ""but Boulez really under stands twentieth century music. He has the ability to grasp what seems chaotic in a piece."" When asked if there is any conductor he especially admires, Para answered, "" I admire so many things about so many people. I would like to have the clarity and precision of Pierre Monteux, the dynamism of Ricardo Muti, and the musical understanding o f Pierre Boulez.""

Cinderella earns new respect,
Band's new album shows evidence of hard work,"By Matthew Wood Staff Writer Recalling Cinderella's debut album, Night Songs, released in 1985,1 would never have imagined this band could achieve any level of respectability. Quite truthfully, I wished they would just go away like so many other pseudo-Bon Jovi bands that come and go in about the same amount of time it takes a Porsche to go from zero to 60 MPH. But something very un expected has occurred, and now I will make my apologies to Cinderella in the form of a very fa vorable review. Rather than continue to pump out trash at the typically re pulsive rate, the band obviously took some time to look at what it was doing. Their 1988 album, Long Cold Winter, featured much improved song-writing and perfor mance. In 1991, this marked pro gression has continued with their newest album, Heartbreak Station. The smartest thing Cinderella did was steer themselves away from the pop metal scene where they started and back towards the roots of blues-based rock. Let me say this is no modest task, and Cinderella has done a commendable job. The new found success of the group has defi nitely resulted from the hard work and vocals of lead singer Tom Keifer who co-produced the new album. Keifer's voice never falters, al though it is harsh enough to turn off potential listeners. Also noteworthy is the consistent and impressive gui tar work. The album's first single, ""Shelter Me,"" which humorously criticizes bigots and hypocrites of society, has been enormously suc- cessful and deservedly so. The sec ond single and title track, ""Heart break Station,"" shifts gears to a very pretty ballad. Keifer has actu ally managed to tone down his voice to a much more desirable level on this song. One of the nice things about Heartbreak Station is that it offers a little bit of every thing. The funky ""Love's Got Me Doin' Time"" owes something to James Brown, and ""Electric Love"" is another excellent modem rock track. I like what Cinderella has done with what basically amounts to a hard working, blue collar ap proach to rock and roll. Heartbreak Station is hardly an ingenious al bum. However, it does offer some thing hard to find among compa rable modem rock groups--a solid album's worth of good music."

Earth Day '91 offers,
live entertainment,"By Jon Elliot Staff Writer In conjunction with recent trends in an attempt to save our Mother Earth, Bucknell University will join the world in celebrating Earth Day 1991 tomorrow. In an ef fort to better last year's poor student turn-out, the Bucknell Concert Com mittee, in association with Bucknell Earth Day Committee, will be offer ing the campus a selection of diverse and stimulating forms of live enter tainment for Saturday's festivities. Although none of the four bands contributing to this year's celebrations are of Grammy status, Bucknellians may be in for a rare treat tomorrow on Swartz Field. The festivities will kick off at approxi mately 11:30 a.m. with the sounds of guitarist Paul Order. In the tradition of J.R. Magnan, Order is known to perform such classics as ""Love the One You're With"" by CSN and Jimmy Buffet's ""Margaritaville."" His most interesting talent, however, is his ability to play the guitar, piano, harmonica and drums simulta neously. Following Order's ""one-man band"" will be the diverse talents of Denny Dent and His Two-Fisted Art Attack. In what is expected to be the highlight of the day's festivities, Dent will incorporate the sounds and rhythms of pre-recorded music with his artistic magistry, buckets of paint"
Earth D ay,
9 i,"and a bare canvas to create a paint ing of the respective musician. Dent once performed his act upside-down to the sounds of Stevie Wonder on the cult television program ""That's Incredible"" and debuted at Bucknell only a few years ago to the music of Jimi Hendrix and John Lennon. After the paint is cleared from the stage, the crowd will be treated to an open microphone from which they will hear poetry readings and the like of local environmentalist Clyde Peeling. Local bar favorites Brenda and the Fender Benders (for merly Vito and the Hitmen) will then provide the sounds of standard rock and roll cover songs and what will be sure to get the crowd going for the day's final act Finishing off the festivities will be the quite familiar sounds of the student-based group, Lopes, Trees and Grass. This group, whose sets arc composed of songs ranging from cover songs of the Grateful Dead to Bob Dylan to the Allman Brothers, is a perfect choice to close out a day filled with sun (let's hope), music and most importantly, infor mation regarding the problems the future holds for our planet and what we, as responsible human beings, can do to prevent the destruction of our earth. So kick off your shoes, throw on a tie-dye and gather on Swartz field for what will prove to be a most enlightening experience."

Film opens new doors to a legend,
The Doors,
takes a good look at Morrison's music and personality,"By Greg Weyant Few entertainers have been able to achieve such legendary sta tus as the late Jim Morrison, former lead singer of the L.A. based rock band The Doors. In director Oliver Stone's latest project, The Doors, the tale of Morrison's dramatic rise to fame and his drunken self-destruc tion is re-created in a larger-than-life biographical epic. Oliver Stone, having already had great critical and box office success with such blockbuster hits as Born on the 4 th of July and Platoon, takes his audience, once again, back to those thrilling days of yesteryear, the '60s. Stone loosens up with the camera and takes on the position of a much more artistic director than he had previously with such films as Talk Radio and Wall Street. This ex perimental trend can be seen throughout the movie, and it is the cinematography that really makes The Doors the dynamic picture that it is. Stone has given the entire pic ture an orange tint, subdy giving the audience the impression that the film is, like its subject, some twenty years old. Stone also treats his audiences to some wild camera techniques such as one scene in which the band members take peyote (a hallucino genic drug), and Stone interprets the hallucinations with camera tricks. At several points in the film Stone tries such subtle deceptions as swaying the camera back and forth, slowly giving the viewer a slightly drugged or drunken state so that the audience can see life through Morrison's eyes. Stone even uses the classic trade mark of the legendary Alfred Hitchcock when he casts himself in a small cameo role as Morrison's UCLA film school professor. Val Kilmer ( Top Gun, Willow) gives a riveting performance as Jim Morrison. Kilmer docs an outstand ing job at capturing Morrison's sen- Courtesy of Dept, of Theatre & Dance Peppy Kokines '91 and Andrew Carman '91 are featured as Bette and Jimmy In the Spring Weekend musical A History of the Ameri can Film by Christopher Durang.

During the concert scenes (some of the most outstanding in the film), Kilmer grabs hold of the au dience with a tight grip almost as if it had been catapulted back to an actual concert and were seeing the ""Lizard King"" himself. Kilmer should also receive high praise for his singing talents. In fact, his vocal similarities to Morrison were a pri mary reason he was selected for the role. Stone has expertly been able to fade Kilmer's voice into Morrison's and vice-versa so that at many points through the picture it is difficult to tell just who is actually doing the singing. Beyond Kilmer the acting in the film is not particularly brilliant. Kyle MacLachlan of Twin Peaks fame gives a good performance as Ray Manzarek, the organist and fa ther-figure of The Doors.

Regardless of the shallow depth of acting beyond Kilmer, The Doors is still a very powerful and disturbing film. Many of the young Doors fans of today see little beyond the sex symbol image of Morrison on a poster or listen to or understand any of the lyrics beyond the simplic ity of ""Light My Fire"". Anyone who knows little about the Doors before seeing this film will come away from the theater with a greater apprecia tion for who and what the Doors ac tually were. The Doors gives us as good a look as one can get in 1991 at Jim Morrison's music, poetry, and personality that made him, as one critic once said, ""the real life Dionysus of Rock and Roll."""
Lewisburg Arts Fest,

Lost time,
The delay that could have been disastrous...,
"At this Thursday's Take Back the Night march, nearly 100 marchers with candles provided",
"light and a sense of security in the darkness, but, only five days before, a victim of sexual assault",
"at Bucknell found herself terrified, alone, and in the dark.",
The case of sexual assault seems almost foreign to a Bucknell world protected by an impen,
etrable bubble. It is not! Those who believe that the Bucknell campus is entirely safe are danger,
"ously mistaken. Bucknellians are not immune from crime, and it is past time they stopped acting",
as if they were. It is time for all of community members to exercise more caution.,
Perhaps more disturbing is the fact that a campus security alert was not issued until Wednes,
day afternoon; preliminary reports of the assault were received Sunday night. Over a period of,
"65 hours, students remained uninformed about an incident that was foremost in administrators'",
minds.,
"Why the delay? To begin with, security was unable to confirm the assault until Monday.",
Security should have a policy of declaring a preliminary campus security alert which would,
inform students that an unconfirmed report of sexual assault has been received. While unneces,
"sarily heightening the public's fears and anxieties might be a problem, it is preferable to danger",
"ous ignorance. The Bucknell community needs to know when, there is an increased threat, so",
appropriate precautions can be exercised.,
"In this case, a lack of communication between administrators meant that students were not",
notified in a timely fashion. The delay illustrates that necessity of clearly specified and under,
stood policies on issuing Campus Alerts.,

Senior learns to accept,
diversity through religion,
All humans are,
created in G od's,
im age and have,
"intrinsic value,",
"worth, dignity",
and rights.,"To the Editor: By the time this is read, Jeans Day '91 will have passed. Sadly, once again every person will have had judgement passed upon them because of the clothes they wore that day. This is a seduc tively easy trap to fall into, and I confess that I have, in years past, caught myself doing the exact same thing. The two 1 categories that seem to have been defined in the past arc ei ther that you wear jeans to support the hu man rights of hom osexuals and are as- sumed to im plicitly give approval to their life style as well, or that by not wear ing jeans, you are assumed to be homophobic, that is fearful of and hateful towards those of homo sexual orientation. As a Christian, I have always found that this day does not pro vide Christians with an avenue to present the biblical view of this is sue. Contrary to what some may think, Christians do not have the option to be homophobic. All hu mans are created in God's image and have intrinsic value, worth, dignity and rights. God is con cerned with justice, and it is a per version of justice to deny someone their human rights for any reason. The Bible commands us to love the sinner and hate the sin. This is not only biblical, but it is I also an accepted psychological I principal known as unconditional positive regard, meaning ""I love you, but I hate what you do."" Homosexual orientation may not be wrong in itself, but the homo sexual act is wrong according to God's standards. But again, that is not a justification for hate or fear. All humans have orienta tions, that, if acted upon and carried out are wrong: to lie, to steal, to harm another person, and the homo- sexual act is not worse than any of these acts, it is the same. O n l y through Jesus Christ can we free ourselves from these things. People _ _ _ _ _ who think Chris tianity is just a list of do's and don'ts have missed the point It's a relationship with someone who loves you with an everlasting love; one who cared enough to take the punishment for my sins and yours. You don't have to give up anything to accept Christ into your life. But once Christ is in our life, He will gradu ally free you from the desire to commit those acts. One Christian friend of mine recently said that she wished she could wear pants that are one half jeans and one half not on Jeans Day. I wish that I could have done that myself to show that I care about the rights of all hu man beings without condoning their actions. Dave Vosseller '91 April 14,1991."
Professor reacts to,
editorial stance,"To the Editor: I have often felt that we (my self and my colleagues on the fac ulty) fail to provide our students with an adequate education. I have never been more convinced of this proposition than when I read The Bucknellian' s editorial last week concerning the faculty's effort to construct a non-discriminatory drug policy. It is apparent from this editorial that we have failed to give our students even the crudest un derstanding of the way in which the market and our government work. Before addressing the specif ics of the editorial, it is important to provide a bit of background. As many people are surely aware, it has become a popular political theme in recent years to be ""tough on drugs."" Ostensibly this has meant crackdowns on drug users and drug dealers, involving stricter enforcement of drug laws and harsher sentences for violators. In reality, it has meant selecting cer tain vulnerable individuals or groups for selective prosecution and harassment. For example, the U.S. invaded Panama and arrested Manuel Noriega ostensibly for his ties to drug dealers. In reality the motivation was that he had been insufficiently cooperative with the Reagan administration's foreign policy agenda. This fact became more apparent after the invasion when the U.S. installed a group of leaders that were even more closely involved with international drug smugglers than Noriega. Other individuals who've collaborated with drug dealers, such as Oliver North, Elliot Abrams, and Henry Kissinger continue to be respected figures in media circles and to play an active role in setting U.S. policy. Domestically, this ""tough on drugs"" fairy tale has meant singling out the most vulnerable segments of U.S. society to be the victims of harsh drug measures. Specifically, this has meant creating and enforc ing drug statutes to be applied to the poor and people of color. An example of this sort of measure is the federal housing regulation that allows families to be thrown out of public housing if any drugs are used, possessed, or sold on the premises. As a result of this mea sure many poor families across the country have been rendered home less simply because of the allega tion that a member of the family has been linked to drugs. (These evictions do not require a trial where the accused are allowed to defend themselves. The standard of proof needed for an eviction is the same that would be needed to ob tain a search warrant. An indi vidual swearing under oath that he/ she had witnessed drug use is ad equate.) Most of the nation would not tolerate this sort of ""tough on drugs"" treatment directed towards themselves, therefore politicians choose to enforce this regulation against only the relatively poor and powerless individuals that occupy public housing. Ostensibly, this discriminatory treatment is justified by the fact that public housing is a privilege provided by the govern ment and not a right to which its tenants are entitled. With the coop eration of the mainstream media, politicians are likely to continue to get re-elected by periodically See PROFESSOR, p. 10"
Groups apologize,
for questionnaire,"To the Editor: On Monday April 8, F.L.A.G., the AIDS Task Force, and Student Medical Services distributed a campus-wide per sonal AIDS questionnaire. Fore most, we apologize to the Hai tians and Central Africans at Bucknell. Our personal ques tionnaire incorrectly placed Hai tians and Central Africans in a high risk category for AIDS. As of April 8,1991, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and the American Red Cross do not consider Haitians and Central Africans at any higher risk than the general population. The effect of our mistake was, least of all, to perpetuate a myth that AIDS is connected to specific"
V,
________________,"categories of persons. Further, we did not consider how this would affect individuals and groups on the Bucknell campus. We are sorry. At the same time we have learned how poorly educated most of the Bucknell campus, including ourselves, is about current facts regarding AIDS. Specifically, according to the CDC and the American Red Cross, persons are considered at higher risk simply by having had any unprotected sex."

In addition, today (Monday, April 8) I've noticed that these people have written their message and reminders in chalk on the walks of the academic quad and uphill UC. I had seen these 'adver tisements' for the first time this morning. On the evening of the very same day, however, I noticed that one of the local activist groups, P.O.W.E.R., had, in addition to writing their own opposing mes sages, obliterated practically every single one of F.A.G.'s messages in that the original message was visu ally distorted to say the opposite of what their original intended mean ing was.

Should students guilty of violations have their names published?,
Welcome to the real world...,"By Bob Ritter Associate Editor, The Bucknellian During their time at Bucknell, students are supposed to become responsible adults, so that they can face the ""real world."" Being a responsible adult involves, among other things, two important factors: learning to take responsibility for your actions, and being able to make decisions concerning important matters in your life. Both of these ideals are dealt a severe injustice by withholding the names of students found guilty of offenses in the University judicial system. In the real world, if someone breaks the law, that information is public knowledge. There should be no special protection simply because the crime takes place on the campus instead of in Lewisburg. Making this information public will clearly serve as a deterrent for the types of crimes which plague this campus, both in preventing first offenses and stopping repeat offenders. An example: a student is found guilty of pulling fire alarms in four different residence halls between the hours of 3 and 5 a.m. on 12 different dates. Either he must pay a $50 fine and remain anonymous, or he will also have his name published in a column listing judicial outcomes (similar to the security log). The additional burden of having his actions become public knowledge, and having to face the several victims of his transgressions across campus each day, will certainly provide a powerful deterrent the next time he considers pulling an alarm. Furthermore, students must take responsibility for their own safety, and must be given the information to do so. Dean Dunlop tells us that the University will protect us, that ""if you have a student you believe is a risk, you get rid of him."" A student convicted of assault after attacking several students in a brutal, unprovoked mob attack on a fraternity house is currently serving his sentence in the Union County jail, but he is still allowed to attend classes. What does it take to be ""a risk"" on this campus? Clearly the University can not be trusted to patemalisti- cally decide what is best for us. Such cases, however, are rare. Most crimes on campus, such as vandalism, altercations, and petty theft, are not enough to get a student expelled, but they are crimes the community deserves to know about. They are also crimes which often do not involve outside criminal charges. Last weekend, vandals caused several thousand dollars damage. These costs are paid for out of tuition funds; this is a crime to which all students are victims. Students should be able to make their own decisions about their personal safety. If you know someone on your hall has been found guilty of several petty thefts, won't you be more careful about locking your door? If you know a student has been in several altercations while intoxicated, wouldn't you approach him with extra caution when he is drunk and belligerent? Such information will serve as a deterrent by stopping a possible crime before it has a chance to take place, and will benefit everyone involved. Bucknell is a small community, but guilty students will face no further attention than in the real world. The Bucknellian is no different than any other newspaper, in that these cases will only be covered and prominently featured to the degree that they are news. If these students do face embarrassment, whose fault would that be, the newspaper who published the information, or the student whose action violated the standards of the community and infringed on the rights of other students? Bucknell students often want very badly to be treated as adults. This is how adults are treated everywhere else--break the law and face the consequences. The Bucknell bubble should not shield these adults from responsibility for their actions."
...policy has prohibited the release of student's names,"By John Dunlop Dean of Students The lead statement of a front-page article in the April 5 issue of The Bucknellian suggested that ""The debate over the release of information on campus crime, long a smoldering issue of contention between college administra tors and student journalists, has recently been brought into sharp focus by a recent court case..."" The reporter. Bob Ritter, went on to state that a federal judge has held that security information, apparently including the name or names of alleged wrongdoers, is not protected by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, com monly called the ""Buckley Amendment."" Thus, college newspaper editors now can report not only the details of an apparent criminal incident but also the name of the ""criminal perpetrator."" For as long as I can remember, University policy has prohibited the release of the names of students who are convicted and sanctioned by the Board of Review On Academic Responsibility or the Committee on Student Con duct. With respect to the latter, University policy provides that ""Ordinarily, no public announcement of the decision of the Committee on Student Conduct shall be made. However, the Committee may make a public announcement if it decides that such notice is necessary to remove a public misunderstanding."" In over 20 years, there has never been an occasion in which removing or correcting a public misunderstanding required more that publishing the details of a matter--never the names of students involved. That long standing policy is exceedingly sound. Historically, the University has taken the position that a student's mistake--behavioral mistake--is a private matter between the institution and that individual. Our position is strengthened not weakened by the judge's ruling in the case cited in the article in The Buck nellian. The judge was dealing with a case involving a public institution. Many such schools have ""police"" forces. Bucknell does noL As a private institution, we utilize security and safety specialists, not policemen. Information gathered by and reports of this department can be ""public information"" so far as details are concerned. More importantly, the outcomes of disciplinary hearings are not ""public"" matters. They are a part of the student's educational record and as such are protected by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. Informa tion from a student's ""educational record"" may not be disclosed to a third party without consent of the student Even if disciplinary outcomes were not protected by the so called ""Buckley Amendment,"" there would be or could be an issue. The issue would be the individual's right to privacy vs. the public's right to know. Where public safety is not endangered, the public has no inherent ""right to know."" Publishing the names of student wrongdoers merely serves as an unintended, additional sanction. Above and beyond official University disciplinary action, the individual is held up to public discussion, speculation, ridicule or embarrassment. Moreover, there is no evidence that publishing one's name in a newspaper serves as a deterrent to repeated misbehavior on the part of the individual or that it deters others from engaging in the same or similar misconduct. One would hope that would be the case and that appears to be the paramount argument for full disclosure including identifying individuals. However, there simply is not data to support a deterring aspect to this practice."

Drum,"By Marc Haimes As I walked across the UC Wednesday morning, I was under the impression that the fabrica! sym bolism was fairly straightforward: 1. Persons wearing jeans be lieve in the rights of all people no matter what their sexual orientation. 2. Persons choosing not to wear jeans are not necessarily AGAINST human rights, but for one reason or another are not as vehe ment in their beliefs. 3. Persons wearing a coat and tie are Homophobic, Communist, Left-Handed, Puppy-Hating, Nazis, and should immediately be killed or. . . ""educated"" by the persons wear ing jeans. To my surprise though, the meaning of the various outfit selec tions by students was not clear at all... First I saw one guy wearing jeans, but they had holes in them! What does this mean? It seemed dis respectful to me. Is he secretly a spy from A.H.C.H.A? ( I'm not sure what the letters stand for, but they sound like phlegm when you say them all together.) I glared at him suspiciously. Then there was this insecure looking freshman who was wearing jeans, but seemed to be in a hurry to get down-hill for some rea son. And how about the female stu dent who was wearing exercise spandex, but a jeans jacket? I mean, maybe she still supports human rights, but had to go to lacrosse prac tice or something. Then there was the guy with the BLACK jeans. No one ever mentioned what black jeans meant. And what about the person wearing the jeans skirt? Or the guy wearing a team slicker with the name Gene on it? Frustrated, I decided to iron- out (no pun intended) the situation. I walked across the floor, ignoring the frantic-sounding sales pitches of the MG 101 salespersons, and made my way to the booth at the far cor ner. I figured the people in this par ticular area would be able to answer all my questions because they had a huge banner with peace signs on it and were playing liberal-sounding music on a radio. I briefly explained my confusion to a sympathetic atten dant at this ""Jeans Day Support Table."" ""Well,"" she said, ""opinions have been mixed. Holes don't mat ter at all, BUT some people have said that the darker your jeans are the more you support human rights. I don't think this is true. It's just a matter of wearing some type of denim on ANY part of the body. "" ""Doesn't that defeat the pur pose of 'Jeans' Day?"" I asked. ""Not at all, because it's also a matter of intent. Like if people come by and take one of these Pink Tri angle stickers that we're giving away, then you know that they sup port human rights for everyone, no See DRUM, p. 10 r"

Professor,"From page 8 throwing large numbers of people out on the street for the foreseeable future. The lie in this story is that the ""privilege"" granted public housing tenants is not really qualitatively different from the government privileges the rest of us require to stay in our own homes. To take the most obvious example, virtually all homeowners take a deduction of their mortgage interest payments from their taxes. In many cases this mortgage interest deduction is a larger government subsidy than that received by tenants in public housing. Since homeowners are a comparatively powerful group however, we don't hear our ""tough on drugs"" politicians advocating throwing them out of their houses if they're found to have used drugs. Furthermore, if we more closely examine the sources from which people derive their income initially, we find the hand of the government everywhere. For ex ample, if someone makes a living by selling their books, it is only because die government will jail anyone who makes a copy of their book without paying a royalty fee. The same government privileges also allow for income from movies, music, or other forms of intellectual ""property"". Even the very entity of the modem corporation on closer examination is revealed to be a creation of the state, a privilege granted to private individuals in order to fulfill a public purpose. (Since forming a corporation is a privilege and not a right, maybe we should require mandatory drug testing for shareholders as a condi tion of receiving this privilege.) The way in which income is dis tributed in this country (as in any country) is the result of an exten sive set of government policies. It is truly remarkable that so many people can somehow believe that the wealth or income that they possess is somehow a natural phe nomenon to which they are entitled by right, whereas only those who receive government welfare pay ments get privileges. Hopefully, students who receive government subsidized loans. They certainly didn't suggest applying it to all college students, a prerogative that is within the government's author ity as a result of funding that it provides to virtually all colleges across the country. My motion was an effort to counteract this politically moti vated persecution of students from lower income backgrounds. The point was simply that if we think the Pell grant drug policy is a good policy then let's apply it to all our"
I have often felt that we (myself and,
my colleagues on the faculty) fall to,
provide our students with an ad,
equate education.,"those of our students who come from comparatively well to do families will find a more truthful way to justify their affluence before they leave Bucknell. With this background, the logic of the proposal I made con cerning Pell grants should be quite evident. Pell grants were estab lished by the government to give lower income individuals a chance to attend college. In the last few years, our friendly ""tough on drug"" politicians, in their usual coward ice, decided to apply a stiff no drug use policy to this comparatively poor and powerless group. Need less to say, these spineless creatures did not suggest applying the same standard to the much larger and more politically powerful group of students. If not, then why should it apply to any of our students? One last point: your editorial (and President Sojka) implied that such a policy would be impractical even if desirable. The story goes, that if Bucknell goes the first route, then it will be at a disadvantage in trying to attract students. If it goes the second route, then we'll be taking money from our law abiding students to support ""criminals"". Taking these in tum, if we think the Pell grant drug policy is a good one and apply it to all our students, then one might legiti mately ask if Bucknell really wants those students (criminals?) who would refuse to cooperate with it. From that standpoint, it would seem to be beneficial to the Univer sity if serious drug abusers or deal ers opted to go to one of our com petitors. If we start from the premise that the Pell grant drug policy is a bad policy, then we better ask what it means to take money from our law-abiding students and give it to ""criminals"" who have somehow run afoul of the government's Pell grant policy. If we feel the Pell grant policy sets a standard that is inappropriate for those of our stu dents who pay full tuition, how can we then feel justified in seeing poorer students being excluded from campus for having been found in violation of such a policy? Do we really believe it's fair that a student in good standing can be prevented from completing his/her senior year because they have been accused of using drugs in a context totally unconnected to Bucknell? Bucknell does lower income stu dents a serious disservice if it can't make a commitment that they will be treated with fairness and dignity once they are here. It would be far better for the school to admit fewer lower income individuals and make a commitment to supporting them, holding them to the same rules as our other students, then to pretend we're helping people by admitting them and then trusting their fate to the whims of corrupt and opportu nistic politicians and bureaucrats.

S.T.O.P. questions U. S. war motives,"To the Editor: Hypocrisy is a major topic of discussion at our S.T.O.P. meet ings, it looms so large in the case of the Persian Gulf war and in U.S. foreign politics in general. Most specifically we want to bring atten tion to President Bush's use of the Amnesty International reports on Iraq in order to justify the attack on that country. None of us would attempt to justify the attack on that country. None of us would attempt to justify Hussein's actions against the people of Kuwait or the people of his own country, his cruelty and inhumanity are indisputable. Some questions must be asked, however, about why the U.S. government chose just the past year to bring attention to his actions, and why they chose to focus on the human rights violations of Hussein, while disregarding violations in other countries. The name of Sadaam Hussein may have been a new addition to most Americans' vocabulary this past year, but for Amnesty Interna tional he has been a well known violator of human rights for years. Amnesty had been working all throughout the 80s trying to bring Hussein's actions into world focus, but the U.S. government conve niently ignored these attempts and instead chose to accept Hussein and assist him in his military buildup. It was not until Hussein took part in actions that were contrary to the interests of the U.S. that our presi dent finally decided to recognize and advertise the criminal actions of Hussein as a way of justifying the massive destruction that was being wreaked upon Iraq. For a government that supposedly loves human rights so much, so much that they were more than willing to blow up a lot of people to get it, I wonder where their commitment to human rights were while this coun try was supporting Hussein. We must also ask ourselves, why Hussein and not others? No one should be surprised to hear that almost all the nations in the Middle East arc severe offenders of human rights. Israel has consistently de nied the rights of Palestinians, often resorting to physical abuse and murder to keep them from demand ing their rights. Yet the U.S. con siders Israel one of its closest allies. Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Turkey are all guilty of serious human rights violations in their use of torture, extrajudicial executions and arbitrary arrests. In his talk on April 15th, Jack Healy, the co- founder of Amnesty International, referred to Syria as the mirror im age of Iraq in terms of human rights violations. Yet the U.S. over looks these violations, Bush cer tainly did not quote any of Amnesty's reports on these coun tries otherwise we might have to face the possibility that while we say we arc fighting against human rights violations we are supporting them at the same time. The list of governments supported by the U.S. that are in fact guilty of extensive human rights violations does not end in the Middle East For years the government of El Salvador has been receiving hundreds of millions of dollars a year from the U.S. which they use to keep the military structure in power and consequently kill, tor ture, and ""disappear"" people in that country on a regular basis. The discussion on how the U.S. govern ment ignores and often supports the cruelty of other governments could go on, but space does not allow for it Basically, it must be noted that the U.S. and indeed much of the world has been operating on a hypocritical basis particularly when engaging in foreign politics. There needs to be a recognition of a basic respect for human rights that will be enforced everywhere, not just in select countries. This is not to sug gest that all the countries that vio late human rights should be handled in the same manner as"

It means that as individu als and as a collective that we no longer support governments unless they work toward eradicating of fenses against fundamental human rights in their country. Jack Healy suggested that instead of using bombs we should use strategies like those used with the Soviet Union, by being persistent in our investiga tions of governments and how they are treating their people, by in specting jails, asking to see prison ers, and by ""raiding their cages."" To quote Amnesty International, ""If peace is to emerge from the present conflict, it can only hope to endure if it is built on principles that include a genuine commitment by every government to the univer sal and impartial protection of the human rights of all people."" War time is not the only time when attention should be brought to human rights, nor is it the only time that we must work for peace, as a matter of fact now is the time that most of the effort has to be put into establishing peace and eliminating the hypocrisy that leads to conflict."

Student,"From page 8 not allow F.A.G. to even get their message across at all. I have seen their flyers being circulated and being hung on bulletin boards, and I felt a strong urge to tear them down because I was so sickened by what they stood for, but I felt their advertisements to hang where ev eryone could see them as F.A.G. wanted everyone to, so that people could form their own opinion about this issue and choose for them selves to wear jeans or not. I fig ured that if their message is not allowed adequately (that is, as they wanted if to get iaerbss), then they wouldn't have the opportunity to see if their message was truly sup ported or opposed by the public. Everyone should be able to voice their own opinion, no matter how radical or unpopular it may be, without anyone interfering with their getting their message across. Now that P.O.W.E.R. has distorted the messages of F.A.G. to give their opposing view point without leaving any of the original mes sages unchanged, F.A.G. is now free to say legitimately that no one received their message because of what was done to their advertise ments, and they will probably con tinue to advocate their views of pro-heterosexuality. If no one interferes with their displays, then the true opinion of Bucknell will be shown, and this group can legiti mately be opposed or supported without interference from any out side forces. Both sides of this issue should be known; when P.O.W.E.R. suppresses what F.A.G. has to say they arc bringing themselves to F.A.G.'s level. It is better to let someone be heard and let the public decide for themselves than to not let them be heard and to present the public with only one side of the issue. Ross Landy '94 April 8,1991"

Bored? Well, if there's writing already on the chalkboard, you're set. The ob ject of this game is to try and figure out what type of class was in the room before you, given the clues on the tablet. Playing time runs from about five to ten minutes, as by then the professor usually has erased the board for his/her own notes. It has the potential to be a boat load o' fun if you have something like ""Sociol ogy 320: The Ethics of Deviant Bo tanical Studies"" in there before you.

Dura tion of this sport lasts until the par ticipants lose interest in squabbling, which they inevitably do, at which time they recede back into the woodwork to curl up and fall back asleep for awhile. The great thing about this sport is that anyone can play. One of the more challenging games around the area involves try ing to find something to divert your attention while sitting in the medi cal center's waiting room. Reading the latest ""In View"" cover to cover is a common strategy for beginners, but can only get one so far in pass ing the hour or so of down-time while waiting for the doctor. Rather, the key to victory lies in losing that inbred sense of self-con sciousness and rifling through the motherlode of venereal disease pamphlets available in the center; veterans of the game, who curi ously enough are also psychoso- matics, have mastered this winning game plan. Jolly good fun. Lively competition for every day is guaranteed with ""Weather Watchers."" The object here is to ac curately predict the day's weather and dress accordingly; and, al though this may seem like a simple enough sport, longtime inhabitants of Bucknell's campus will tell you otherwise. Why? Mostly because the temperature and front variation experienced in each 24-hour period in the Susquehanna Valley is known to incorporate the weather of as many as five different climatic zones of the world at a time. Main drawback: This game is an acquired taste, requiring a wide variety of seasonal clothing and a lot of pa tience. And finally, room picks. Kind of a cross between ""Scruples"" and pit bull fighting, only more in tense. The opportunity for this high- spirited competition only rolls around once a year, thank God. Participants pack as much schem ing, jostling, and conspiring for the prime housing on campus as they can within the period of about two weeks, all of which makes for a rousing good spectator sport if you're a senior or graduate student. Stakes are high, and pride certainly is not a prerequisite-in fact, grovel ing is often encouraged. Not for the faint of heart And there you have it-all one needs for a raucous spring.

Journalist brings humor to Gulf War,
P.J. O'Rourke tells tales of his personal experience in desert,"By Susan Smith Staff Writer Nationally known and widely read humorist PJ O'Rourke ""would have carried water bottles"" to be in the Middle East during the Persian Gulf War. Instead this journalist for Rolling Stone, National Lampoon, Car and Driver, Playboy, and Es quire worked as an ABC radio cor respondent, supplying war updates O'Rourke explained that there just was not enough time on nightly newscasts to launch into a feature on the soldiers playing Nintendo to keep themselves busy until the ground war started or all the car wrecks that took place because ""of people looking at the sky instead of the road during oncoming SCUD at tacks."" It was for these types of tales that O'Rourke took his ""Holiday In to thousands of Americans as they drove to work in the morning. He became a part of ""Club Scud"" be cause of his journalistic "" desire to see something."" What O'Rourke saw is the subject of his new book, Give War a Chance, and also of the hour-long look at the Middle East he presented to a full audience Thurs day, April 11th in Vaughan Litera ture auditorium. Reporting from the Middle East proved to be the ""sandy 13th step after the 12th step in the A[lcohoIics]A[nonymous] pro gram,"" said O'Rourke. Because the Muslim religion prohibits alcohol, this was the ""first war covered by sober journalists."" According to O'Rourke, the quality of the inter view questions was Oprah Winfrey standard at best. Even though O'Rourke feels that the American public suffered from bad reporting, it was not due to a lack of reporters being allowed to cover the war. Hell"" in the Middle East. As a hu morist, he observed everyday situa tions and began to make light of them. The journalists, natives, and especially the soldiers found that humor was the best way to remain sane while surrounded by sand. O'Rourke said, ""certain predictable types"" provided the best laughs. The Saudis and Iraqis were two of his fa vorite targets. Although there was no crime in Saudi Arabia (they cut off fingers for stealing - ""an idea that might work well in New York""), the high ways were covered with trash. Along the desert roads there were ""no lizards with little tongues"" just ""blue and pink shopping bags."" The Saudi's incredible wealth was also satirized. The corp of jounalists joked about ""giving a bottle of champagne to the first person to see a Saudi lift something heavier than a dollar bill.""

The Iraqis were ""best at loot ing,"" according to O'Rourke. Their favorite items to steal were televi sions and family valuables. Taking shampoo, cooking utensils, and food was not beyond them though.The Hilton hotel from which most of the journalists broadcasted looked like ""all the worst rock bands had stayed there at once"" after the Iraqis ran sacked it. Once the ground war started though, O'Rourke compared the battle to ""Ohio State against a Montessori school."" Even though Iraq had been ""fourth on the charts"" for power, there was no comparison between our army and theirs. O'Rourke offered much praise of our Armed Forces. ""They worked in 110 degree weather for five months, seven days a week, with 18 hours on and 6 hours off-and they only griped about the food."" Unlike Vietnam, troops even asked for General Schwarzkopfs autograph. According to O'Rourke, the Kuwaiti people also thought highly of the American troops. During their liberation celebration little girls wore dresses made to look like U.S. and Kuwaiti flags and many street signs were painted over with the name Washington Street. After six days of celebration, O'Rourke thought ""Go get a broom and a mop and clean this country up,"" but instead he and the other journalists boarded a flight home. Armed with as many Scotch minia tures as his hands could hold and the airline would supply, he returned to the United States to tell his tales. After all, ""when the fat man in the bathrobe (Kuwaiti royalty) comes back, the war is over."""

But thanks to our courage to drive onward, past the ""Welcome to Bloomsburg"" sign, we found what just might be one of the best hidden secrets in Cen tral Pennsylvania (as far as res taurants are concerned anyway)- Harry's Grille. Julie and Steve recommend the mozzarella sticks ($4.50) as an appetizer, but are slightly wary of the peel-and-eat shrimp ($5.95)- they were a bit difficult to peel for the peel-and-eat variety. Julie ordered the Barbecued Chicken ($11.95) which was ac companied by a baked potato and tossed salad. The entred con sisted of THREE chicken breasts -- too much for even George Foreman to dine on...and it was delicious! The baked potato was of mutant proportions, but the size did not adversely affect its flavor. The tossed salad was well-tossed and colorful. Steve tried the Grilled Salmon ($14.25) which was ac companied by a choice of two: tossed salad, mutant potato, rice pilaf or pasta with marinara sauce. Steve selected the salad (very well tossed) and the pasta. Both were quite tasty. Steve's entred, the Grilled Salmon, was, as the menu says, ""grilled to perfection"". The filet, similar to the potato, was of mammoth proportions. For dessert, Steve and Julie decided to share the Turtle Cake Sundae, a homebaked devils food cake topped with chocolate chips, butterscotch, pecans, ice cream and several other very fattening ingredients. While it proved to be quite delicious, Steve and Julie were simply too stuffed to polish it off. We recommend Harry's without reservation. The atmo sphere is casual, and the food is great! An excellent choice for parent's weekend or graduation, when all of the restaurants in Lewisburg are overflowing with Bucknellians. As Joe-Bob says in his drive-in movie reviews, Steve and Julie say check it out!"

Softball dominates Mt. St. Mary's,
Fink loses no-hit bid with two out in the seventh inning of the first gome of yesterday's two game sweep,"By Todd Bianchine Staff Writer The women's softball team pushed their record to 18-7-1 yester day, taking both games of a double- header against ML St Mary's, 8-0 and 8-2. Mt. St. Mary's is the sec ond non-conference team Bucknell played this week as they split a twinbill with the University of Maryland at Baltimore County on Wednesday, winning the first 3-0 while dropping the second 3-1. In the first game against Mt. St. Mary's, Ellen Gabriel '93 came up big, poking a two-run single over short in the third to give Bucknell a 5-0 lead. Jen Kalochie '91 had a pair of RBI singles in the 4th and 6th, scoring Mollie Laubach '94 from third both times. Kolochie ended the game 3-for-4 with two stolen bases. Lisa Fink '93 proved to be untouchable on the mound as she had the Mt. St. Mary batters waving at her change-up, set up by her fastball. She had a no-hitter with two outs of the seventh inning before allowing a single. She ended the game allowing just one hit while striking out twelve as Bucknell took the game 8-0. In the second game Karen Smolskis '91 hit a two-run homer in the third bringing Fink in from third. Smolskis went two-for-two with four RBIs on the day. Carol Gesler '93 followed the home run by hitting a triple in the same area as the homer by Smolskis, and later coming in to score. Sharon Nichols '91 got the victory to push her record to 9-3 on the year. All three of her losses have been by a 1-0 margin. She leads the team with a 0.43 earned run average. Michelle Kofron '93 pitched the last two innings for the Lady Bison. ""These were some good wins for us,""said sophomore outfielder Jill Szafranski, who went two-for- two in the second game. ""It's going to get us up for this weekend when"
W,"Colin Bridgewater/The Bucknellian Pitcher Sharon Nichols '91 fields a comebacker during an earlier season game. Nichols went five scoreless innings yesterday to notch her ninth win of the season, lowering her ERA to 0.43. we have our conference games."" The Lady Bison took the road last weekend for a pair of Patriot League twinbills. On Saturday they faced the pre-season favorite. Army, in what turned out to be two gruel ing pitcher's duels. In the first game Nichols kept the Cadets off the basepaths and off the scoreboard for the standard seven innings, but Bucknell couldn't put anything up on the board either as it was stymied by a three-hit per formance from the Army pitcher. Nichols held out until the 10th, when Army was finally able to score a run, winning the game 1-0. Both starting pitchers went the distance for their teams. In the second game of the doubleheader, Bucknell ended its scoring drought when Laubach reached home in the third to give the Lady Bison a 1-0 lead. The Cadets bounced right back in their half of the third when they plated two run ners off Fink, to gain an insur mountable 2-1 lead. Bucknell threatened a few times but were un able to tie the score, stranding seven runners on base. Bucknell woke up the bats on Sunday against Fordham, as Sza franski hit a combined five-for-six in the two games. In the first game, Nichols proved to be tough once again as she gave up only three hits while striking out ten in seven full innings of work. While Nichols was frustrating the Rams batters, Jen Yuengling '93 was causing a fracas of her own. Yuengling scored three of Bucknell's eight runs from the lead- off spot, including a two-run homer. Fink and Szafranski each had two hits out of the teams' eleven. Buck nell wound up winning the game in easy fashion, 7-0. The second game against Fordham was nearly a carbon copy of the first as Yuengling went two- for-three from the top spot, scoring and driving in one of Bucknell's runs. Szafranski had the big game, though, going three-for-three in cluding a run-producing triple, she"
Tennis goes in fieldhouse to,
defeat the rain and Broncs,"By Mike Markovich Staff Writer The men's tennis team fin ished a relatively light week of play yesterday and now must prepare for a tough upcoming week. This should prove to be the fullest week of the season, with matches against Fordham tomorrow, Lafayette next Tuesday, and Franklin & Marshall Wednesday. After these three away matches, the team will have to travel once again, this time to Colgate for a dual match on Friday followed by the Patriot League Championships over the weekend. Play this week was limited mainly because of the cancellation of Monday's match at Lafayette due to rain; the match was rescheduled for next Tuesday. The team got an other unwanted break on Saturday as their home match versus Rider was moved inside due to rainy Lewis- burg weather. This prompted the teams to decide to play the match in a format in which only four singles games and one doubles game would be played. It was also agreed that no player could compete in more than one match. Head coach Craig Reynolds decided that it would be best to have Jerome Charlier '92 pair with Chris Rimpel '93 for the doubles combi nation in order to give the two some playing experience together in preparation for the absence of Charlier's normal doubles partner, Cris StenstrOm '94, this past week. StenstrOm left Bucknell Sunday, re turning home to Switzerland to re ceive his green card. He will return this weekend in time for the remain der of the season's matches. The strategy turned out to be a good one, as Bucknell pulled out a close 3-2 victory in the match. Bucknell lost the top two singles matches, with Bruno Barbera '94 going down 7-5,6-4 at number one and Andrew Cantor '92 falling 7-6, 6-1 at the number two spot. But the squad's lower ranks came through as StenstrOm won 6-0, 6-1 at number three in what Reynolds called ""his best match of the year,"" and captain Scott Bank '91 was victorious at number four, 6-3,6-0. These essential victories took the match for Bucknell, as Charlier and Rimpel had battled back from a first set loss to capture their match earlier. They were fighting Rider's normal number one duo of Dave Tanovan and Marc Petchel, who captured the first set 5-7. But once Charlier and Rimpel became com fortable with each other, they breezed through the remaining sets 6-2,6-4. The cancellation of Monday's match at Lafayette left yesterday's informal scrimmage with Erie's Mercyhurst College as the team's only real match play of the week. Mercyhurst is a Division II squad with some nationally ranked players, and Reynolds did not seem surprised that Bucknell recorded only one singles victory on the afternoon. He commented, ""Our players are still very young, so this match was really only intended as a much needed workout for this slow week to work on shot selection and match attitudes. But it was a good workout and we're considering adding them to our schedule for next year."" The team begins its rough up coming week at Patriot League op ponent Fordham's courts tomorrow. Reynolds expects a competitive match versus a Fordham squad which he notes ""didn't lose any drove in three runs and scored two on her own. Despite a bit of a wild perfor mance by Fink, she was able to keep the Rams from scoring, limiting them to one run. Bucknell was able to score eight runs off eight hits, completing the sweep 8-1. ""We really bounced back well in the Fordham series,"" said Szafranski, ""our bats really started to come alive, and everything seemed to be working right for us. Hope fully, we will win our games this weekend to move closer to Army in the standings."" With the victories over Fordham, Bucknell moved to 4-2 in Patriot League play. Bucknell will look to improve upon its record to morrow when Lafayette comes into town for a doublehcader, with the first game starting at 1 p.m. The Leopards are trying to re bound from consecutive 6-25 sea sons. They will rely heavily on third baseman Tricia Wolfe who has a lifetime .335 batting average. Buck nell had no trouble with Lafayette last year, sweeping a doublehcader from them, 13-0 and 16-6. The Lady Bison will get to take on Lehigh on Sunday as well. Thegame time at 1 p.m also. The Engineers should not be a terribly difficult contest either. They are a young team with eight freshmen and no seniors. They lost both games last year to the Bison 3-0 and 4-2.

IUS,"*04 players last year, so should be pretty respectable."" Play continues Tuesday with the rescheduled Lafayette match, one which Reynolds thinks the team should be able to win. He expects another competitive match but calls the Lafayette team ""young and inex perienced"" and predicts, ""If we play up to our potential, I think we'll have a reasonable chance at winning. But if we have an average or below av erage day, as we did against Dela ware last week, we'll get beat"" The team then faces Franklin & Marshall on Wednesday before travelling to Colgate for the three- day weekend. The Colgate dual match on Friday, like the Fordham contest tomorrow, should provide Reynolds and the team an opportu nity to get an idea of the kind of play it will be seeing from these teams during the Championship weekend. The coach sees Army as the obvious favorite to take league honors, with Colgate, Fordham, and Lehigh ex pected to finish high as well. As far as Bucknell's chances go, Reynolds feels that, ""With the youth and experience level of our squad this year, we would be very happy with a third place finish in the league. I think that is a realistic goal with the return of StenstrOm and everyone playing to a reasonable level of potential. I really see us fighting with Colgate, Fordham and Lehigh for the spots below Army, who is stronger than everyone else. Our finish will largely depend on our luck in the draw, which will deter mine how often we have to butt heads with Army early. If we can get past them without too much trouble, we should finish relatively strongly.""

Golf heads to Colgate for,
Patriot League tournament,"By Chris Downe Staff Writer CBS sports analyst Jim Nantz summed it up best when he said, ""This is a great month to be a golf fan,"" (or something to that effect). He of course was referring to the Masters in Augusta, Georgia and the Patriot League Championships in equally scenic Hamilton, New York. This weekend the Bison will travel to beautiful Colgate for the inaugural Patriot League Golf Championships. Army, Colgate and Lehigh are expected to capture the top three spots with the Bison pre dicted fourth. In order for Bucknell to crack the top three, it would take ""career rounds from our guys and a less than typical effort from one of the top teams,"" said Head Coach Tommy Thompson. ""I'm just being realistic. Those teams [Army, Colgate, and Lehigh] are so deep and strong. Our goal will be to break 320 each round,"" continued Thompson. The format for the weekend does not provide the underdog with much of a chance at the heavy fa vorites. Two 18-holc rounds will be played tomorrow and then a final 18 holes on Sunday. ""You can only be six strokes off after one round, but that snow balls into 18 strokes,"" said Thomp son. Each school will count its four best scores out of six for its total round score. ""Depth really comes into play in tournaments such as this because if you get three good scores and three not-so-good scores, you have to count one of those not-so- goods."" That's exactly the problem Bucknell had in its most recent match against Loyola, Western Maryland and Georgetown last Tuesday. Don Hansen '94 shot another 75 to medal for the Bison while Doug Dollenberg '94 and Chris Curti '94 had 85s. Captain Michael Smigie '92 turned in an 82. After that, however, Bucknell was left to count one of those not-so-goods, an 89. Loyola took first place with a solid scholarshipesque 387 and Western Maryland took second with a 408, eight strokes better than the Bison. Georgetown showed up unscheduled and finished fourth with a 420. ""The gap between our top scorer and our bottom scorer is too large,"" commented Thompson, ""We need more consistency out of everybody."" Last weekend, Bucknell trav elled to Penn State to participate in one of the nation's largest team tournaments. The Bison played the blue, or long, tecs better than the white, or shorter length, tee boxes. The first day placed the team on the short tees where they shot a 327 four-man total. Perhaps they were caught up in the Nittany Lions' spring football practice. Joe Patemo's troops took the next day off, allowing the Bison to concen trate on golf. Sunday's 325 gave the Bison a tournament total of 652. Dollenberg was the lone Bison to break 80 in cither round. Rumor has it that Colgate has hired the services of Carl Spackler, the infamous assistant greenskeeper at the Bushwood Country Club, to prepare the course for this weekend's tourney. Ian Woosnam will pass on his invite to the tournament in order to make room for some of the young aspiring linksters. Bucknell has yet to break 320 for a four-man score on a course other than its own. Hansen could walk away with all-Patriot League honors if he continues his excellent play. 0MU"

Bucknell is coming off a sue-! cessful weekend against two tough Patriot League teams, and the team is beginning to show signs of life.

Joe Susan heads to Princeton,"Peter Ho/The Bucknellian Erik Herrema '93, here featured against Princeton earlier this season, has scored five goals and three assists in eight games. The midfielder has also won greater than three-quarters of his face-offs this season. By Scott Brown Staff Writer Joe Susan, the Bison football team's assistant head coach and of fensive line coach, has been named offensive line coach at Princeton. Head Coach Lou Maranzana described his reaction to Susan's decision to leave Bucknell. ""He felt he had a good opportunity at Princeton. We will miss Joe. He was a good coach, but we will have to do our best without him. We will hire someone else and do just fine."" Susan came to Bucknell in 1981 after being a graduate assistant coach on the football team at Dela ware, finalists in the NCAA Division II playoffs in 1978. Susan's other coaching experience comes from working as an offensive line coach at Gettysburg College. He excelled at offensive tackle when the Blue Hens captured two Lambert Cups in 1974 and 1976. Both of those teams qualified for the NCAA Division II playoffs. He was named Delaware's offensive lineman of the year in 1976. Susan coached eight years before receiving the added respon sibility of assistant head coach which he shared along with Mike O'Connor, who was also the offen sive coordinator and offensive backficld coach. These promotions were made by Maranzana when he was named Bucknell's 23rd head football coach in 1989. Maranzana has not assigned anyone to take Susan's spot as assis tant head coach. ""The job of assis tant head coach was a special thing that fit Joe as he liked helping out with the organization and manage- ment of the team. I can spread out his responsibilities around the staff."" Susan left the Bison after they finished 7-4, their winningest season in 26 years. In addition, the Bison amassed 1797 rushing yards, the most by a Bucknell team since 1980, the year before Susan came to the Bison. The job of finding a replace ment has already begun led by Maranzana and Bucknell Director of Athletics Rick Hartzell. According to Maranzana, the search has pro gressed well. ""We're doing pretty good. There are a lot of applications. Within two weeks we will interview three guys and hopefully we will have a decision in early May."" Meanwhile, the Bison team continues their spring workouts preparing for its opener in the fall."

(800) 333-INFO,"By Chris Drowne Staff Writer While most people in our nation's capital were seeking shelter from last Saturday's cold, steady rain, Georgetown University hosted the 1991 Hoya Invitational. The men's and women's track and field teams from Bucknell, Cornell, and Penn State joined Georgetown at Washington D.C.'s Kehoe Field. Many Bison turned in strong individual performances, despite not qualifying anyone for IC4A's or ECAC's. For the women, Dawn Ellery '94 captured second in the high jump, just two inches short of the winner. Gina Abraham '93 fin ished fifth in the 1500-meter run. The Lady Bison placed two winners in the top ten in the 800-mcter run. Kathy Wurstcr '94 and Beth Muehl '94 finished seventh and eighth, re spectively. In the 3000-meter run Kristin Opdyke '93 grabbed eighth and Kelly Marsh '91 twelfth. On the men's side of the led ger, Tom Wuchenich '92, John Lewis '93, and Judd Jarden '93 placed third through fifth, respec tively, in the 3000-meter steeple chase. The Bison men managed to place several athletes in the various throw-in events. Scott Croasdale '93 finished fifth in the hammer throw while Jamie Zapko '93 won the jav elin throw. Pete Gregory '93 and Sam Bijlie '94 earned third and Michael Klemen/The Bucknellian Pete Doherty '94 leads the pack on his way to victory in the First Annual Bucknell Springtime Invitation held at Christy Mathewson Memorial Stadium two weekends ago. Doherty placed first in this weekend's Section Three 800-meter run at the Georgetown Invita tional. fourth place finishes in the discus throw. Gregory also grabbed fourth in the shot put Jason Cahilly '92 and Tom Eagleson '93 finished sixth and sev enth, respectively, only 0.5 seconds apart in the 1500-meter run. The 800-meter run was broken up into three separate sections. In the first section, Norbert Berenyi '91 fin ished sixth and Jeff Loomis '92 eighth. Dave Slupe '93 won the sec ond section while Martin Kondrath '94 and Greg Yochum '94 finished fifth and sixth, respectively. Section three saw Pete Dougherty '94 and Chad Evans '94 placed first and sec ond. The fifth, sixth, and seventh places in the 3000-meter run be longed to Bison Michael Bronson '93, Bob Kelly '92, and David Howard '93, respectively. Two weeks ago prior to today, Bucknell alum, Brian Harshman '85, finished first in the Open Division men's 5000-meter race at the Colo nial Relays in Williamsburg, Vir ginia. The former cross country and indoor hack and field captain holds the school record in that event This Sunday both the men's and women's teams will travel to Shippensburg.

FM.,"By Kyle Betz The Bucknell Crew team traveled to West Point on April 13th to face Army in a Patriot League dual regatta. The mens' varsity four had little difficulty winning its race, in 7:07 ; one minute, 16 seconds ahead of Army. In that boat, Kim Dobies '91, coxed Dave Rhodes '92, Doug Lebda '92, Tripp Dixon '91, and Kyle Betz '92. As the women's varsity eight shoved off the dock late in the afternoon, the wind on the Hudson River began to howl and brought with it large swells. The women were forced to row upstream in search of calmer water. Finally, as the two crews started amist perilous conditions. The Lady Bison and the Lady Knights traded the lead several times in the contest and Bucknell emerged triumphant in a 1500 meter race, shortened from the normal 2000 meters due to dangerous conditions. The men's varsity lightweight eight faced an unusual challenge. They were pitted against Army's heavyweight as well as lightweight eight on the rough water that day. Staying with the Army crews, Bucknell finally took third in 7:19 behind Army's lightweights and heavyweights who finished in 7:01 and 7:09, respectively.

Both Bucknell boats surged to an early lead over the Army boat and it turned into a Bucknell vs. Bucknell face-off. After falling be hind, the Bison novice heavyweights sprinted toward the finish, but couldn't catch their lightweight teammates, who finally won. Army finished third. The Bucknell women's novice eight boat jumped to an early lead which the Army women could not match. Bucknell won with a time of 7:37 and Army crossed the line in 7:52. The Army crew team showed their hospitality by hosting Buckncll's team Friday night before the race on Saturday. They fed the Bison and gave them a tour of the West Point facilities on Saturday morning. The stay provided an unique opportunity for Bucknell students to experience life in a mili tary academy. Bucknell plans to re ciprocate the favor of the Army team at a home regatta. Bucknell Head Coach John Skotetis expressed his excitement over the upcoming LaSalle Invita tional on April 20th on the Cooper River in New Jersey. He is anxious for his team to row as well as pos sible in that important race, which potentially could grant Bucknell a seed in the Dad Vail Regatta.

The Tigers answered right back, tying the game in their half of the inning, getting a run off Denis Maguire '93. Bucknell took a brief lead in the fifth, scoring a run to take a 3-2 advantage. The lead was short lived as Princtcon surged ahead with three Peter Ho/The Bucknellian Tri-captain M ark Kennedy '92 connects on a pitch during a game played earlier this season. The catcher has started every game of the season thus far for the Bison. runs of their own in the bottom of the seventh to take a 5-3 lead. But, the Bison battled back in the ninth inning with a four-run assault. Dave Kocrncr '92 tied the game with a bascs-loadcd single before Ahrens got the game-winning RBI driving in two runs on a single. For the game Ahrens went 4 - 5, coming a home run short of hit ting for the cycle. He also drove in three runs on the day. Three other Bison had multiple-hit performances as Mark Kennedy '92, Kocrncr, and Steve Gyimesi '93 each went 2-for- 5. Jack Kazanijian '93 entered the game in the seventh inning and earned the win, upping his record to 4-2. Bucknell went into last weekend's three game scries against the Fordham Rams with great ex pectations. Its 12-8-1 record and 2- 1 Patriot League mark gave the team every reason to believe it could compete with the powerful Rams. This early season scries would have a great impact on the final Patriot League standings. Saturday's twinbill was plagued by the rain which is so unseasonal for spring in central Pennsylvania. The Bisons' defense was as ugly as the weather in the first game. Bucknell outhil Fordham 11- 8 in the game, but seven walks by pitcher Mike Rizzi '91 and five er rors by the Bison allowed Fordham to get optimum production from its hits.

Lax sweeps Buckeyes,
and Falcons in tourney,"By Jam ie Diaferia Staff Writer The Bison men's lacrosse team completed a successful week end on Sunday after defeating Ohio State and Air Force decisively. The team heads to Lehigh for a crucial game on Saturday. The Bison were given a pre view of what they would take on when Air Force took on Ohio St.. The game, won by Air Force, went into overtime before Brian O 'Rourke scored just over a minute into play for the 10-9 victory. The Bison knew what to ex pect when they entered the game against Ohio State on Saturday. Having played against some of the best teams in the country earlier this season, Bucknell was looking for a quick victory. The game could not have answered their needs any bet ter. The Bison won the game 19- 8, powered by sophomore Todd Streclman's five goal, five assist game. The offense exploded with a flurry of shots that resulted in five goals from Doug Dc Pietro '92, and two goals apiece from Kevin Roth '92, Tom Davis '93, and Justin Zackcy '94. The Bison were also once again blessed with solid de fense, as Colin Barker '94 recorded seven saves on 13 shots and Matt Wojnovich '94 recorded seven saves on nine shots. Bucknell refused to rest on its accomplishments after Saturday's game, when it came back the next day and worked tirelessly to defeat Air Force 17-6. This game was typified by more of a consistent team effort, with Roth and Davis leading all scorers with three apiece, fol lowed by two from Zackey, Matt Pearce '91, Strcclman, and DcPictro. Strcclman led all players with three assists. Barker led the defense, re cording 15 saves on 21 shots. Head coach Sid Jamieson was im pressed with the quality of the victo ries. ""We played two good institu tions,"" he said. "" Our level of play is getting better and I think we reacted well to playing again on Sunday."" He also said that he has noticed a definite change in the way the team has played. "" We are more disciplined,"" he said. ""Our transition game is getting better, and we're getting up and down the field pretty well."" He had said earlier that there had been a problem with maintaining posses sion of the ball against some of the better teams. This has changed, he said, because of "" confidence and experience."" He added, ""People look like they are more comfortable on the field. Also, because Rick See M E N 'S L A X , page 14 -  r ' WE&mSEEma Colin Bridgewater/ The Bucknellian Colin Barker '94 makes one of his 15 saves against the Air Force Academy in the Bison's 17-6 thrashing of the Falcons as Michael Conway '92 and Andy Linden '92 look on. lead with two runs in the first and second innings and single tallies in the third and fourth. The Rams cruised through the middle innings and went into the seventh with a comfortable 8-2 lead. The Bison made a valiant ef fort with three runs in the bottom of the seventh, but B ill Conklin re lieved Jim  M cDerm ott for the "" Bronx Bombers"" and he finished off the rally, capping off a 8-5 Ram win. Larry Trout '93 led the Bison with three hits and three RBI's for the Bison. Dave Koemer '92 and Roger Ahrens '91 also contributed to the Bison effort with three and two hits, respectively. Ahrens also con tributed a RBI. The Bison, however, endured the continuing rain to capture game twoofthedoublchcader. The star of the nightcap was ace hurler Kurt Waldner'93. Waldner went the dis tance and posted a five-hit shutout. Unlike the first game, the Bison played errorless defense behind Waldner, who helped himself by walking only one. Waldner struck out two hitters on the way to posting his second win of the season. The Bison picked up a run in the first as Steve Gyimesi '93 scored on a basehit by catcher Mark Kennedy '92. Bucknell picked up another run in the third as Trout drove in Gyimesi for his fourth RBI of the day. These two runs were all the Bison needed as Waldner led them to a 2-0 victory. Dan Krewson '91 went to the mound for Bucknell in the third and final game of the scries. Unfortu nately, the Bison made the same mistakes that cost them the first game o f the series in falling to Forham 3-0. All three runs Krewson allowed were unearned as three er rors killed the Bison. On the other side, M iguel Jimenez, a great Dominican hurler in the tradition of Juan Marichal and Pascual Perez, shut out the Bison on five hits. Jimenez struck out eleven Bucknell hitters over nine innings to post his fourth win without a loss. Ahrens was the only Bison to dis tinguish himself, picking up two hits on the game. This weekend the Bison will host the Lehigh Engineers for a three- game set. Lehigh is probably the worst team this side of Houston (Even the Braves would demolish these guys.) The Engineers have a team ERA of 7.15 that is expected to increase exponentially against the strong Bison line-up. There are a few bright spots for Lehigh. Head coach Skip Schultz has said that senior Van Shell, "" could be the best catcher in the league."" Last year, in only 17 games, he was able to lead the Engineers in batting (.310), RBIs (14), total bases (32) and slugging percentage (.762). Colin Brldgewater/The Bucknellian M ike Rizzi '91 was the starting pitcher in the opener against Fordham. His seven walks along with five Bucknell errors enabled the Rams to go on to an 8-5 Patriot League victory."
W om en's lax crushes East,
Stroudsburg for second win,"By Eliza Wampler Staff Writer On Wednesday, the women's lacrosse team battled East Stroudsburg University, capturing another win by the score of 17-8 to improve its record to 2-8. The lacrosse ladies took con trol of the game from the beginning taking a 9-3 first half lead over East Stroudsburg. Bucknell dominated all as pects of the game. The attack dis played great movement, as the midfield created successful transi tions between the defense and of fense. Defensively, the Bison were able to successfully hold East Stroudsburg's offensive force. Head coach Jennifer Avcrill had a little anxiety going into the game, but was pleased with how the women played. She said, "" The team really needed a big win like this to boost their confidence, and prepare them for Friday's game."" The high scorer for Bucknell was Sue Wells '93 with six goals. Leslie Why '92 and Jen Kehoc '94 each fired in three, while Dori Lynn Ellwood '92, Jen Hayes '93, Kristina Haas '91, Trisha Way '91, and Julie Goeller '91 each contributed one goal. Last weekend, the team trav eled to Lehigh where they lost 15-4. The loss dropped them to 1-2 in the Patriot League. A verill thought that the Lehigh score was not reflective of the team's play. ""To an outsider, it looks as if we got beaten badly, but I think that it was one o f our most competitive and strong games. Our downfall was our mental lapses at midfield on which Lehigh was able to capitalize."" Lehigh was able to utilize their fast breaks down the middle of the field to catch the Bucknell defense off guard. Goalie Karha Foster '92 was stellar in the net, as Haas and Way were strong defensively. Foster came up big, making 25 saves in the match. Kehoc sparked the offense with two goals while W ells and Ellwood each added one. The Hofstra game was not a strong display by Bucknell. Avcrill remarked, "" We simply lacked in tensity and enthusiasm. We came out fiat, and our play reflected it."" Hofstra's strong and aggressive play took advantage of Buckncll's lapse, taking a 5-0 halftime advantage be fore winning 10-5. Avcrill also emphasized how pleased she was with her bench play. "" My bench players came into the game very assertive and fired up."" Leading the way for Bucknell were Kehoc and Sue Signori '93 each with two goals while Why scored one. Foster again played well, making 17 saves. Tomorrow night, the women will be facing a tough com petitor in Villanova at 7 p.m. m"

Anim al behavior program,
exceeds federal regulations,"By Elizabeth Danneberg Staff Writer While the newest regula tions under the Animal Welfare Act of 1985 have necessitated universi ties nationwide to improve the liv ing conditions o f primates under study, Buckncll's animal behavior program will not need to make many changes. The primates, which include approximately 12 each of squirrel monkeys, red-bellied tamarins, Japa nese snow monkeys, and hamadryas baboons, are housed socially, that is, within their species, in spacious en closures which, "" far exceed mini mum space regulations"", says Nancy Caine, associate professor of psy chology. It is Caine and Professor Douglas Candland, the animal be havior department chair, who super vise the primates. Primate research is conducted in several of the psychology and bi ology courses, and in addition, Caine and Candland have been undertak ing their own research programs in dependently. "" The animals are all used educationally so that students can learn about animal behavior. We conduct no invasive research, that is, surgery, on the primates, and we do not restrain them except in the case of a medical emergency. All of the research is done through obser vation alone,"" said Caine. The animal behavior pro gram has done its best to promote the psychological well-being of the pri mates. For instance, the squirrel monkeys and red-bellied tamarins, whose natural habitat is trees, are housed in outdoor cages abounding with perches and branches so that they can jump around. The primates are additionally permitted to breed, By M ark Abrahamsen Staff Writer Today and tomorrow are des ignated as the first weekend of the University' s "" Bring Y our Own Beer"" (BYOB) policy at Bucknell's fraternities. The purpose of the trial weekend is to test the new policy procedures and acclimate the cam pus community to a B YO B  system before it is fully implemented, effec tive next semester. B Y O B  entails that alcohol of any kind will not be served by fra ternities this weekend, and indi vidual houses will not be held liable for potential problems caused by guests. The party procedures, which were drawn up by the Inter-fratemity Council (IFC), will be as follows: A) Guests will have to surren der all alcoholic beverages at the en trance of the function to a host, who will transport the drinks to the fraternity's segregated (21) section; B) Guests are limited to one six-pack of 12-oz. cans of beer (no bottles). The fraternity is not respon sible for returning specific brands to guests. C) Guests will receive a ticket in exchange for each beer (limit six). D) The guest may enter the function and proceed to the 21 sec tion. At this time hc/she will be proofed for identification and re ceive a hand stamp. The guest will be able to redeem his/her tickets for beer (one at a time). E) The individual fraternity another source of natural stimula tion. ""The animals must be allowed to live the way they ordinarily would. This poses a big problem for biomedical research because the ani mal must be placed in small cages and injected, therefore causing dis tress to the animals. So it is these pharmaceutical research labs which have to change the m ost,"" said Caine. The only change which the newest regulations under the Animal Welfare Act require of Bucknell is for all lab surfaces to be easily wash able. Therefore, the lab's wooden walls must be replaced. The univer sity recognized the need to renovate the old psychology lab building, and so these new regulations provided a further motive. Presently the out door primate cages arc being rebuilt, See A N IM A L S, page 2 will not be responsible for reimburs ing guests for any beers not con sumed (i.e. no ticket refunds). F) Fraternities and guests are required to abide by all applicable Pennsylvania State, Bucknell Uni versity, and Inter-Fraternity Council alcohol and social policies. Fraternity presidents decided to institute the new policy after much pressure from their national organi zations, which found it increasingly difficult to receive insurance as a re sult of the high-risk liability that spe cific houses endure. Denis Maguire '93 president of IFC, noted, ""Law suits are forcing the issue, but soci ety is dictating it as well."" At this time, no individual stu dents nor organizations have ex pressed favorable opinions o f a B YO B  policy. "" No one is really happy about it right now-- students, fraternities or security. BYO B  is be ing forced upon us and we are going through with it unwilling, but the change is something we must do,"" said Maguire. Potential problems include students walking around campus with open containers as they visit By Darren Milltnan Staff Writer Vandals ravaged the Bucknell campus in the early morning hours on Sunday April 14 causing exten sive damage to benches and picnic tables. According to an initial crime report, at 12:30 a.m. a student secu rity aide observed two students, later identified as Brian Trainor '94 and Steven Fryer '92, in the process of overturning a bench in front of the downhill side of the Elaine Langone Center. The report stated that Trainor and Fryer fled towards the Olin Sci ence building where they were ap prehended by Capt. M ichael Amarante and Sgt. Donald Mull of the Dept, of Security and Safety. Sgt. Hosterman of the East Buffalo Police Dept, responded to a call from Vince DeCerchio, director of Security and Safety, and cited Trainor and Fryer for criminal mis chief. The two are charged with "" recklessly tampering"" with two benches in front of the downhill ELC. A  hearing for the case has been set for May 7 at 10 a.m. Both Trainor and Fryer are pleading not guilty to the charge, despite the fact that the crime report explains that "" they stated that they... overturned two benches in front of the E LC ."" DeCerchio said that the ac cused ""were very nonchalant about the whole thing, as if they thought it was all very funny."" George Trutt of the Physical Plant informed DeCerchio that the total damage done to the benches would cost the University $289. DeCerchio added that "" within a one hour period leading up to the bench incident"" vandals hurled four picnic tables off of the dining hall patio and destroyed a bench by throwing it off of Freas Hall. In ad dition, numerous benches and picnic tables surrounding the ELC and the academic quad were overturned. In all, nearly $1,500 in damage was done between 11:30 p.m. Saturday, April 13 and 12:30 a.m. April 14. Trainor declined to comment and Fryer was unable to be reached and did not return The Bucknellian 's phone calls. Although DeCerchio admitted that he does not understand the reasons for the rash of senseless crimes on campus, he did indicate that most incidents had two points in Sec V A N D A L ISM , page 2 multiple fraternities. Having stu dents carry the alcohol from house to house increases the possibility of underage drinking and littering throughout the campus. Vince DeCerchio, director of security and safety, expressed con cern that there are many angles to the issue and a utopian plan would be difficult to achieve. "" I'm really con cerned about how this process can be handled successfully, and if some one knows how, that person should give me a call,"" said DeCerchio. Security will continue to pa trol as usual with frequent checks of See B Y O B , page 2 Colin Bridgewater/The Bucknellian Along with squirrel monkeys like this one, Bucknell's primate cages also contain red-bellied tamarins, japanese snow monkeys, and hamadryias baboons.

Fraternity nationals claimed potential liability charges and sanc tions against the individual Univer sity charters as the main cause for needing a change in the current sys tem. This trend to install a risk man agement policy for fraternities has spread throughout the nation, where a movement has taken place to put tighter restriction on an individual fraternities' activities. Maguire noted, ""Society's concern with alco hol has increased exponentially with lime, while fraternities have fallen behind the scope of society in recent years."" Whether the trial weekend be comes a success or a disaster rests solely on the individual houses. ""It is a concern that fraternities will be slow in response to the changes in the system,"" said Maguire. ""I've spoken with all of the fraternity presidents, and my overall impres sion is that they will stand strong and not bend the rules this weekend."" Five houses will host BYOB- style parties on Friday: Kappa Sigma, Phi Gamma Delta, Lambda Chi, Sigma Chi, and Chi Phi. On Sat urday, Theta Chi, TKE, SAE, SPE, DU, SAM, and KDR will try the new policy. After this weekend, IFC will meet and discuss the need for changes before next semester, but Maguire noted that the foundation of the new policy will likely remain."

"Sojka discusses Bucknell,",
future of higher education,"By Tara Gilllgan Staff Writer Across the nation, universities are struggling to deal with issues of price sensitivity and student demo graphics, but, according to President Gary Sojka, the prospect of Bucknell's future remains positive. ""We're turning into a very good edu cational value, but the stresses and strains are going to be apparent,"" he said. Sojka, in an interview about the general state of the University, pointed to student enrollment and the allocation of budgetary funds as major issues facing Bucknell. A na tional decrease in the number of stu dents entering college and a height ened concern over the cost of higher education will, for the most part, by pass the University, he said. Student enrollment for the in coming freshman class ""seems to be running ahead of last year in terms of deposits coming in,"" and the University's decision to increase its comprehensive fee by only 4.5 per cent, the smallest increase in 28 years, is a ""bold step"" according to Sojka. The University has managed to escape some of the difficult issues other colleges continue to face. Price sensitivity has become an in creasing concern for colleges trying to balance comprehensive fees and operating costs. The cost of private institutions on the whole continues to rise, and some students answer by entering public universities. ""Insofar as the price gap be tween the privates and the publics seems to grow, and it seems that it is continuing to grow, I think more and more institutions will find them selves in jeopardy. We're already seeing some privates close and we're seeing a fair amount of merging in the private sector, the result being lhat in a few years there will be con siderably fewer private institutions than there arc today,"" Sojka said. Sojka spoke of a voucher sys tem as a possible solution to an in creasing price gap. In such a system, the large state subsidies which pub- hclp the money?"" he asked. Sojka said that, in general, the nation is ""reaching a critical point"" in providing affordable, quality edu cation to all sectors of society. ""I'm sympathetic with the governor; I'm sympathetic with the legislature,"" he said. Yet Sojka still does not wish to connect his statements on the issue to the University. ""It's not a Buck nell plan,"" he said, "" It is a new way for people to be thinking about edu cation."""

#President Gary Sojka,"lie schools depend upon would be split between private and public uni versities, increasing the affordability of all schools. The system would also help stale governments, which find it increasingly difficult to ad equately fund public schools. The ratio of poor to wealthy students at both private and public schools is roughly equivalent, ac cording to Sojka. ""I believe the idea is interesting to kick around and I believe it begins to point out how wc'rc funding higher education... Should [public universities] be get ting significant state subsidies to get inexpensive higher education when in fact the state claims that it has trouble getting enough dollars to While universities throughout the nation face problems of student demographics and increasing tuition costs, Bucknell has confronted these same issues. Whereas other schools in the state have been forced to raise comprehensive fees, Bucknell has chosen, instead, to increase the fee only slightly. ""Interestingly, combined with that step is a restatement that we are not going to back away from our continuing efforts to make Bucknell a better place,"" he said. ""We are continuing to add faculty while hold ing the student body at a constant level,"" Sojka continued. According to Sojka, making the school affordable to all students"

""Wc'rc going to put in a cedar mulch base much like the one at Sunflower day care center."" The project's $1,000 budget will be divided evenly between con struction of a new base for the equip ment and refurbishment of the old apparatus.

India holds na,
tional elections,"India's national elections in May could change the course and character of the world's second most populous nation, which is currently in great political ferment at home and uncertain of its international role. The voters will have the choice between three candidates, who each represent a different party, instead of voting simply for or against the Congress Party, for the first time since independence in 1947. Other options, besides the In dian National Congress Party led by Rajiv Gandhi, are the Janata Party, a center-left coalition advocating a social revolution to break the caste barriers, and the Bharatiya Janata Party, a right-wing party with a vi sion of a more openly Hindu, less secular India. The Janata Dal party is led by V.P. Singh, while Lai Kristian Advani leads the Bharatiya Janata Party. The 1991 election follows nearly a year and a half of political turmoil in India. Many feel that the Congress Party system is not work ing, and that India is in need of a radical change."
Iraqi troops pull,
from Kuwait,"The American flag now flies in areas which were former Iraqi out posts above Zakho. During the past weeks, the American Military has managed to set up camps for Kurdish refugees and other groups who seemingly have no place to go. These camps are being established amidst a fervor to rid the country of all those associated with the Iraqi Forces, namely those soldiers still creating problems. On April 21, an outbreak of violence by unknown armed men wounded five refugees by firing into a crowd awaiting food distribution. This incident caused much fear in the people, although the military has stated that the Iraqis have basically adhered to the message from the American Military: ""Do not interfere with the efforts to aid the refugees."" Chaotic events, such as the shooting, are setting back the plans for aid, but not to a great extent. Said Colonel Jones while describing the campaign to help the refugees rebuild, ""If you come back here a month from now you'll see a city of tents. If you come back six weeks from now, you'll see a country."""
Policies affect,
USSR and Japan,"On April 19, Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu of Japan and Presi dent Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union completed their nego tiations over land disputes remain ing from the end of World War II. The talks began with many promis ing signs, but ended in only minor changes. Although the main territorial dispute still remains, both sides say that they are relatively pleased with the outcome; surprisingly, Kaifu more than Gorbachev. There were 15 agreements signed when their meetings were completed, and their subjects ranged from trade fairs to air rights. The one item not dis cussed during the talks was that in volving large-scale Japanese eco nomic cooperation. The most positive outcome for Japan was the concessions made over the Kurile Islands."
Killings rise in,
NYC last year,"The New York City statistics for 1990 were recently released, and their results are both incredible and bewildering. The most frightening statistic revealed a 17.8% increase in the murder rate and a 7.4% increase in robberies during the past year; however, the same study has shown that other crimes, namely rape, bur glaries, and aggravated assaults are down from 1989. Deputy Chief Michael A. Markman, commander of the Office of Management Analysis and Plan ning, determined that although the statistics were overwhelming, the bare facts show a steady rise in murder and robbery across the United States. In fact, says Markman, New York City's crime rate is actually increasing more slowly than that of the nation. In an attempt to explain the jump from 1,905 incidents of kill ings in 1989 to 2,256 murders last year, city officials are citing drugs and guns as the determining factors. They claim that the increase in drug dealings and the availability of hand guns is proportional to the rise in"
Free Speech,
Act is endorsed,"If passed, the ""Collegiate Speech Protection Act,"" currently before the U.S. House of Represen tatives, will allow students the right to try to appeal any college or uni versity regulation that would punish them for making so-called ""hate speeches."" The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has endorsed the act so students whose universities do not have such regulations, will have the right to appeal. For example, earlier this se mester, a student at Brown Univer sity was suspended for two years by the University for shouting some drunken epithets against another's religion. There are other ways of ad dressing free speech and bias issues without enforcing speech restric tions. The ACLU has recommended education, through a classroom en vironment of social program, as an option. -- The Tartan"
Paper Theft At,
F&M College,"At Franklin & Marshall Col lege two weeks ago, all 2,000 copies of The College Reporter were stolen from bins in the College Center. No one has been charged with taking the papers as of yet Vice President of educational services, Alice Drum, and the direc tor of Safety and Security, Glenn Adamire, began an investigation into the theft immediately, checking residence halls, the fraternity houses and recycling bins, but there is still no information as to their where abouts. Angry and appalled by the theft, Drum addressed a larger con cern than just the theft of the paper-- censorship. Drum insisted that, ""People have to realize that these in dividuals responsible wanted to censor the College press and the voices of the members of the College community."" Individuals who may have any knowledge of the incident are being urged to step forward and cooperate. Until this time, the inves tigation will continue. --The College Paper"
B.Y.O.B. Policy,
Implemented,"A unanimous decision has been made by the presidents of the fraternities to designate this weekend as a trial B.Y.O.B. weekend. This means that no alcohol will be served by any fraternity house this weekend with no exceptions. Guests attending fraternities, who are limited to one six-pack of 12 oz. cans of beer, will have to surren der all alcoholic beverages at the en trance of the function, at which time they will receive a ticket in exchange for each beer. Then, the guest may enter the function and proceed to the 21 section to be proofed and stamped. At this point, the guest can exchange their tickets, one at a lime, for beer. The fraternity is not held responsible for reimbursing guests for any beer not consumed or for re turning specific brands to guests. And, fraternities and guests must still abide by all applicable state, univer sity, and IFC alcohol and social policies, as well as this new proce dure. The purpose of this trial weekend is to test these party proce dures and to give the campus a chance to experience B.Y.O.B. be fore it becomes fully effective next semester. Lambda Chi, Theta Chi, Fiji, Chi Phi, Sigma Chi, and Kappa Sigma will be following these pro cedures on Friday, while TKE, SAE, SPE, DU, SAM, and KDR will use Saturday as their trial date."
"""Reverse discri",
"mination"" rises","Seven white college students' ""reverse discrimination"" lawsuit against the federal government mi nority scholarship policy might re flect a growing trend toward conser vation, some observers say. If these white students suc ceed in their lawsuit, approximately 69% of campus scholarships for mi nority students would either be scrapped or redistributed to students on the basis of grades or family in come. On March 22, the white stu dents sued the U.S. Dept, of Educa tion, calling some campuses' efforts to recruit minority students by of fering special scholarships discrimi natory. The students asked that all federal funds from schools having race-based scholarships be withheld. The students were recruited from Maealester and Mercy Col leges, the Universities Virginia, Texas, Iowa and California at Los Angeles. The suit is also being filed against Southern California by the Washington Legal Foundation. The concept that setting aside benefits for minorities cheats whites of those benefits is not a new notion at all. It has long been a favorite topic of conservative groups. The conservative Washington Legal Foundation first joined the controversy last April when it filed a complaint with the Education De partment about a race-based schol arship at Florida Atlantic University. The organization was still waiting for a reply from the department in December, when it was announced that race-based scholarships violate the 1964 Civil Rights Acts, which bans awarding financial aid ""based solely on the race of the recipient."" Schools continuing to offer these types of scholarships were to lose federal funding. However, two weeks later, after extensive criti cism, the department said that col leges could give grants to people based on the color of their skins if the money came through private do nations. Then, on March 21, the new Secretary of Education announced that schools could return to the methods which they practiced, be fore December. This case could be the most significant campus ""reverse dis crimination"" effort since the U.S. Supreme Court's 1978 ""Bakke de cision,"" in which a white student, Allen Bakke, complained that the University of California-Davis med school rejected him in favor of sev eral minority students having lower grades and board scores than him. The Supreme Court agreed, calling Davis' affirmative action program an unconstitutional punish ment of Bakke because of the color of his skin. -- The Clarion Call random murders; however, there is much controversial debate over whether or not this statement is fac tual. Those arguing the city's point wonder why the rate of rape would decrease, as many rapes are also drug-related. The only answer which may be considered valid is that which declares people to be more cautious than they were in 1989, thereby decreasing the risks they might previously have taken. The new murder rate in New York City is the highest thus far, with the lowest occurring in the mid eighties with approximately 1,300 deaths. In order to change the statis tics for 1991, officials have estab lished more programs for youths, as well as more uniformed police on the streets."
Job hunting,
tough for grads,"Those seniors graduating this year undoubtedly have many high hopes for their futures, whether in political science or the cover of Fortune magazine. However, the class of '91 is quickly discovering that, due to the recent recession, jobs are becoming more and more diffi cult to find. The job market has decreased by 30% from last year, experts say, meaning that there arc now 1.5 mil lion less career opportunities avail able. This all-too-rcal figure is rap idly causing many seniors to lower their job expectations, apply to graduate schools as a means of de laying the inevitability of searching for employment, or join such public services as the Peace Corps or Teach for America. Even with so many se niors dropping from the job ""scramble,"" rejections arc being re turned to graduating students with increasing rapidity. The main areas of the country affected by this recession are the Northeast and the New York region; therefore, say counselors on cam puses, flexibility is essential in the hunt for potential employment. Se niors who have been searching for jobs since the beginning of the year are beginning to take whatever arises, even if that means lowering their expectations and working with a small organization instead of a large corporation. The graduating class must also be prepared to move around the country, depending on job possibilities, even though that may not be their first choice. There is hope, however, say many officials, who claim that the recession is temporary, and that jobs may begin to appear on the market as soon as next year. Their advice is to take time and accept lower-level jobs even if they are not first- choices."
Bush pus!,
new school bill,"President Bush, in a campaign to improve schools nationwide, spoke in favor of a new bill on April 18 before a crowd of educators, business leaders, Governors and members of Congress. This bill would grant government money now being spent only on public schools to private and parochial institutions as well. Those proposing the bill believe that it will enable parents to decide exactly which school their children should attend, without the price of the education playing a fac tor in their evaluation. President Bush is also re questing $435 million from Con gress and $150 million from private businesses to research new methods of teaching and learning. This would include the implementation of an American Achievement Test which would be structured to be used dur ing schools as a standard for knowl edge in basic subjects. This method of testing is to be established by 1996. Those opposing the bill feel that giving money to parochial schools violates the line between church and state. They also believe it will cause public schools to de cline in student enrollment, therefore causing the quality of education to decline as well. ^All International and National News' Briefs are precis o f New York Times articles .

Econ prof examines,
risks of incinerator,"By Andrew Cohen Staff Writer Leon Shenandoah, Tadodaho, or chief, of the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) Nation, and Denise Waterman, their Traditional RccordskeCpcr, addressed a capacity crowd in the Langone Center Forum on Saturday in conjunction with Earth Week festivities. Shenandoah and Waterman's lecture was spon sored by Chi Phi Fraternity as part of the Biff Hoffman Memorial Lec tureship. They discussed how Native American philosophy relates to ""mother earth."" Waterman spoke first and de scribed the historical traditions of the Iroquois. ""The Haudenosaunee are called the people of the Longhouse. Tonight we're going to be thinking about the Longhouse as a philosophy that stretches over many groups of people,"" said Waterman. In addition. Waterman ex plained that several themes pervade Haudenosaunee tradition, one of which is the tree of peace. Waterman explained that she hoped others could take the ideals of the tree of peace and integrate them into their own view of the environment, ""The tree of peace is something that we hope stretches through our broad longhouse in North America."" Shenandoah explained that the reason Iroquois place such a high value on the environment is due to the importance they place on the natural order of things, ""...our spiri tual way of life is in harmony with nature, with all animals, because we depend on one another."" Waterman also commented that it is a vision of the future and a duty to one's offspring which de mand that we treat mother earth with respect. 'The children of our nation is what keeps us going. The McDonald's cup on the ground won't naturally dispose of itself, it is left for someone else. Whatever we leave we must leave in great condi tion for our children. This is the goal of the actions and the laws that we carry out everyday."" Waterman summarized the in ternational work that the Haudonosaunee do to promote envi ronmental awareness. One of the activities they arc participating in is an environmental symposium in Brazil in 1992. She encouraged the audience to be politically active on behalf of the environment, ""The U.S. delega tion is one of the strongest at the meeting. You should find out what your own country is saying on be half of you."" The Iroquois are also involved in saving a forest in Canada. ""There is also Amazon North. The Crccs own a forest area that is the size of France; it will be flooded by dams set up by the Canadian government [unless something is done to stop it]"" Shenandoah asserted that the reason the environment is in such dire shape is that the rest of the world is focusing on the wrong types of is sues. ""It's the money that's going to ruin this world, the money is behind the pollution. Money is their power, our power is spirituality."" He also described the folly of pollution since, according to Shenandoah, ""We all know how we have pollution of the air, the water and the land. We cannot survive without the air, we cannot survive without the water, we cannot survive without the land."" Finally, Shenandoah encour aged action, but, he also noted that only the world as a whole can act to save the environment. ""One person cannot stop it, ten people cannot stop it, 100 people cannot stop it. Everybody's got to do the same thing."" By Travis Elliott Staff Writer On Tuesday, Nancy White, as sistant professor of economics, ad dressed the perceived risks of living near a hazardous waste facility, and the effect of these perceived risks on local property values. The lecture, entitled ""The Economic Develop ment Aspects of Locally Undesir able Land Uses (LULU's),"" was sponsored by the Buckncll Environ mental Action Committee which has planned a series of lectures dealing with U.S.P.C.I.'s proposal to build a hazardous waste incinerator in Gregg Township, in northern Union County. According to White, the per ception of risk causes people to at tempt to distance themselves from possibly hazardous facilities, and when people move out of an area, property values decline. White said, ""Those who arc too poor to move, .those attached to the community in some other way, and those who may not sec the incinerator as a threat are the ones eventually damaged by fall ing property values. These equity problems should be of some concern to us."" White noted that Pennsylvania has no legislation requiring reim bursement for the real economic costs associated with risk percep tion. She noted that the benefits of a LULU such as a hazardous waste incinerator arc widespread, accruing to all consumers of products which produce hazardous wastes; however, the cost associated with the disposal of those wastes are borne by the lo cal community where the LULU is sited. According to White, a decline in property values could actually re duce the local tax base, and effec tively negate the economic boost brought by more jobs. In addition, White staled she was ""suspicious of the claims of job creation by U.S.P.C.I."" White called for federal legis lation requiring reimbursement for the costs involved with the perceived risks of LULU's. She stated that those costs would eventually be passed on to the consumers who are actually accruing the benefits, and these higher prices could cause a de crease in consumption and eventu ally decrease the output of hazard ous wastes."

According to Cumberland, Martinez explained that the success of the federal investigation at UVA did not indicate that a nationwide fraternity inquiry would take place. ""He [Martinez] stated that the federal government was not going to be any more lenient towards frater nities, but that they were not out to get people cither,"" noted Cumberland.

Musical parodies American films,
A History of the American Film,
opens tonight in the University Theatre,"By Bryan Clark The musical comedy A His tory of the American Film, by Chris topher Durang, opens tonight at 8 p.m. in the University Theatre in Coleman Hall. Performances will continue each night through Mon day, with a special matinee show at 2 p.m. on Sunday. The play presents a hilarious parody of American film history, from early silent movies to modern classics. Durang follows five stock film characters through over fifty years of film, supported by an en semble of fourteen ""contract play ers"" who together play over one hun dred roles. Val Marsdcn '93 and Andrew Garman '91 play the pri mary ""onscreen"" couple: Loretta, a wide-eyed ingenue, and Jim my, a sentimental gangster.

This show has provided excit ing opportunities in all areas of the atrical production, involving both students and guest artists in the col laborative process. Scenic designer Jason Aten '91 explains, "" As a stu dent, it is great to work with a team of professionals. For me, this has been the most educational aspect of the student design curriculum."" Aten has also enjoyed the challenge of presenting the audience with "" mean ingful symbols"" which will evoke memories of historical moments in American film. Costume Designer Wendy R olfe, who received hcr M .F .A . from the Yale School of Drama, ad mitted that there arc so many cos tumes in the musical that she was "" afraid to count"" them all. However, she enjoyed this enormous opportu nity: ""With this show, I have been able to create costumes from the tail end of the Victorian era, all the way through the 1960's.""

Orchestra will,
feature Sojka,"By Julie L . Shurilla The Bucknell University Or chestra, under the direction of Christopher Para, assistant profes sor of music, will perform May 3 at 8 p.m. in the Weis Center. Their program will feature "" Lincoln Por trait,"" by Aaron Copland, with a narration read by President Gary Sojka. "" Lincoln Portrait"" utilizes quotations from various writings of Lincoln's, many of which were un known before the piece was writ ten. Para said that the piece is in teresting because it not only paints a picture of Lincoln, but also de scribes our nation at the time of the Civil War, "" who it was and what it stood for."" The piece was com m is sioned in 1942, during a lime when our country was involved in war, and, with the recent Persian Gulf crisis, Para said ihc piece is "" very timely now."" Para actually decided to per form the piece last year because he felt that it also ""was appropriate for this time at Bucknell. It portrays the struggle which our country was going through at the time of the C iv il W ar, and we arc going through a time of struggle here at Bucknell. The faculty and admin istration have been faced with mo mentous decisions which have no easy solutions."" Para requested that President Sojka narrate "" Lincoln Portrait"" because he felt that the piece re flected "" beliefs held by the Univer sity"" and that the president "" speaks for all of us, the University com munity as a whole."" President Sojka admires the part he reads not only because of its limclcssncss, but also because of its "" economy of language, which is reminiscent of poetry,"" poetry being a personal interest of his. Para noted how unusual it is for a president to be as involved as Sojka. "" He is willing to enter into a new experience and get involved with a student ensemble,"" said Para. On his part, Sojka makes ev ery effort to attend all of the stu dent performances on campus, al though he admitted that it is diffi cult at limes to squeeze in them all. "" Lincoln Portrait"" opens with melodics which, in the second half, form the accompaniment for quotations from Lincoln's writing. Although the quotations arc spoken and not sung, Sojka said it is ""very demanding"" to perform because it requires "" timing and precision. I have to start and end at the right lime."" Sojka had heard the piece performed once before by the Philadelphia Orchestra with Henry Fonda as the narrator, a difficult combination to emulate. The orchestra will also be performing a medley of songs from Leonard Bernstein's "" West Side Story."" Bernstein was a good friend o f Copland' s, and both passed away just last year. For this reason, Para thought it would be fitting to honor the two of them in this concert. They will also be per forming works by Berlioz and Bizet. The orchestra and Sojka will also perform "" Lincoln Portrait"" this Saturday night at the Prism Concert at 8:30 p.m. in the Weis Center. This concert is unique in that it features many performing groups from the music department."

There may be some truth to that statement, but most would cer tainly agree that the Bison Chips are a fun, entertaining, and talented per forming group. Fortunately for their fans, the Bison Chips will be singing tonight in the second annual Chipfest at 8 p.m. in the Weis Center.

As glorious as it may sound, however, a little rain must fall even in the life of a Bison Chip. Lunstad reported that while at Milton Area High School, the group ""got in trouble for running in the halls."" But according to Rick Cranford '92, the trip was not a total loss. ""We were a big hit-- we almost had five prom dates."" The Bison Chips also fre quently sing around campus, in cluding performances during Fresh man Orientation and Christmas Dinner. Coming upon May 15, there will be a Bison Coffeehouse concert featuring all four campus a cappella groups: the Harmonex, Some Sing ers, the Silhouettes, and the Bison Chips. For those who just cannot get enough of the Chips' melodious strains, call 523-6627 and order a Bison Chip tuck-in. If all else fails, there is one more place on campus where they might be found, and it is not Rooke Chapel, or the Music and Arts Building, or even the Weis Center. Check out the tunnel under Route 15. The Chips say the tunnel has wonderful acoustics and regard it as the best addition to the campus. For Chipfest '91, the Chips will perform songs from their older album, Naturally, as well as pre miering three new tunes. One of these will feature Chris Williams '92 and Eric Lebenson '92, two Chips from the same home town who have been singing together since third grade.

Professor's journeys come,
in photography exhibit,"By Charlie Collier For those who think of the li brary as a place to avoid unless ab solutely necessary Marianna Archambault, professor of modem languages, offers an entirely new reason to visit with her compelling photography exhibit ""Textures and Reflections."" The exhibit, made up of 39 photographs from cities such as Paris, Venice and New York, of fers you the chance to sec the world without ever having to leave the li brary or even open a book. ""Textures and Reflections"" is a fitting name for the exhibit as almost every photo captures a pat tern or angle that makes one want to examine it more closely. Archambault explained that the name for the exhibit came from showing slides of her photographs to friends, and through this, similar words describing the photographs were often used. For example, one of Archambault's friends com mented that ""when I look at a pic ture of yours I feel like touching it."" This is no doubt a common re action when viewing her photogra phy as she has timelcssly captured depth and textures that make one want to feel as well as view her art. Archambault is the chair of the department of modern lan guages and secretary of the faculty. Her education began in Prague, Czechoslovakia and included time in Brooklyn during grade school and a year at a French high school in Belgium. She completed her studies at Penn State University, receiving her bachelors and mas ters degree and Ph.D. Remarkably, however, Archambault has had no formal training in photography. She does not develop her own prints and uses rather standard equipment. 'It's simply a camera where I can control the shutter speed and the light exposure,"" she commented. Her eye truly guides her and rarely does she crop or alter her photo graphs once they have been devel oped. ""I do the framing as I take the picture,"" she explained. It is this gift for ""framing"" that comes through quite clearly in her work. Every inch of her photographs help to enhance their feeling, whether it be a small dog on a rooftop or the subtle patterns of a wall or sidewalk in a background. ""I like very much the idea of reaching out to others through my pictures,"" remarked Archambault with pride. She has certainly com piled an exhibit that achieves this goal. Last weekend she entered sev eral of her photographs in the Lewis- burg Festival of the Arts. Her work received one first place and three seconds. These photographs are on display at the Lewisburg Photo Shop on Market Street. ""Textures and Reflections' is currently on display on the sec ond level of the library, adjacent to the office and continues into the periodicals section. The exhibit will be displayed throughout the summer. Courtesy of Marianna Archambault This photograph of Le Pont Neuf and the Seine River in Paris is one of 39 photographs now on display in Professor of Modern Languages Marianna Archambault's exhibit ""Textures and Reflections"" on the second level of the Bertrand Library."

Jazz,
and Rock Ensemble to,
jam in the quad tomorrow,"By Jon Elliot StaffWritcr Arc you looking for something to do with your parents after dinner Saturday night and before you take them out to chug beers or do the cir cuit? Well then, look no further than the academic quad for what many hope will prove to be a most enter taining time for young and old alike. The student run and student directed talents of the Bucknell Jazz and Rock Ensemble, BJRE, will be per forming, free of charge and weather permitting, at 10 pm in the academic quad. Under the direction of student director Dart Janucski '91, the En semble will be performing such Jazz classics as ""April in Paris"" and ""'A' Train"" as well as more recent hits such as Pat Mcthcny's ""First Circle"" and the theme song from ""Late Night with David Leltcrman"" as composed by Paul Shacfcr. BJRE recently returned from Edison, New Jersey, where they competed in an exhibition and were critiqued by the likes of Jazz great Justin DiCiocio. This year's crop of musicians has proven themselves to be one of the best ensembles Buck- nclI has to offer. This is BJRE's 17th year of existence at Bucknell. ""We are mostly made up of non-music majors, you know guys and girls who just dig playing mu sic,"" says BJRE trumpeter Joe Zavory '93, ""but it's pretty serious."" Made up of 17 full-time members who have been selected through a rather informal auditioning process the ensemble practices a minimum of three hours per week as a group The group is monetarily supported by the University, which according to Zavory, ""keeps us solvent"" BJRE will also be performing at the Weis Center on May 15, as the headlining act. With the enthusiasm of the ensemble, this free perfor mance will hopefully allow BJRE to prove themselves as an alternative form of quality entertainment within the Bucknell bubble. BJRE is ex cited to perform for parents and stu dents alike, and according to Zavory, ""we want everybody to come out and see us strut our stuff and 'display our wares'."""

Bison crowd catches,
Jazz & Blues Express,"By Vic Tchipraut The Bison Jazz and Blues Express continued to reward its audiences kst Sunday with the Sallins/Marshall Project. For the first time, tlie concert series was able to attract a good-sized crowd with this hiavy R&B/funk-influ- enced fusion group. Led by Joe Sallins, the Sallins/Marshall Project has been playing for four years throughout the Northeast at various clubs and universities. All compositions are written and arranged by bassist Sallins, with occasional help from his newest keyboardist, Ed Smith. With the input and inspiration of added to the flavor by continuously improvising on the drum set Us ing a simple five drum set, he man aged to create the sound and com plexity of an elaborate set-up. The excitement of the Sallins/Marshall Project was evi dent on the faster tunes, where the skill and personality of each musi cian exploded into endless solos appearing from nowhere and then easily fading with the utmost el egance. The concert had an unhurried, knowing feel of a band that has been through endless jam sessions and has focused on mak ing music not for the pop charts, but for the few that appreciate such jazzy spontaneity. The group Courtesy of Bison Programming Committee Rick Marshall, left, and Joe Sallins, right, of the Sallins/Marshall Project entertained a good-sized crowd at Sunday's Bisonjazz & Blues Express. his close friend and drummer, Rick Marshall, the band has surpassed the amateur level and, despite their humble beginning, has become one of the leading underground fusion jazz groups around. The highlight of the perfor mance was the sleek interplay of electric bass guitarist Tyrone Blanton along with Sallins' piccolo electric bass guitar. It is the syn ergy created by these two bassists that has established the group's style in the realm of fusion jazz. Blended with these funky bass lines was the synthesizer of ""Frantic Mintic"" Smith. Marshall ended with Blue Bossa, a percus sion spectacle in which the two bassists traveled around the Bison, drumming on all possible surfaces and then inviting two members from the audience to try their hands on a set of congas. The Sallins/ Marshall Project is certainly rede fining the role and future of fusion jazz with their funky bass lines and innovative techniques. The Bison Jazz and Blues Express will bring the blues sounds of Mike Dugan and the Survival Band to the Bison this Sunday at 7 p.m."
Art of Armstrong '69 to be displayed,
Twenty-five years of Bucknell grad's art will go on exhibit tomorrow,"By Karen M. Ebersold The Bucknell community will have the distinct pleasure of viewing ""the most comprehensive exhibition in terms of its breadth and range"" of David Armstrong's work over the past twenty five years. Entitled ""David Armstrong: Twenty-Five Years of Painting,"" the exhibit will include acrylic paintings, egg tem pera paintings, water color paintings, oil paintings, pencil drawings, stud ies for larger works, and the larger works themselves. The Center Gallery in the Langone Center will host the exhibit which will run from April 27 through June 9. The show will in deed prove the potential for artistic growth at this University as Armstrong is a 1969 graduate of Bucknell, achieving national success with many acclaimed exhibitions both on the East and West coasts. Armand Hammer, the late philan thropist, gave an Armstrong work to President George Bush. He has had eight one-man shows in New York City, and his work is a part of many private and museum collections, some parts of which, not seen by even Armstrong himself in the past 25 years, have been specially bor rowed for this exhibit. The Academy of Artistic Achievement, established in 1990 by Bucknell's Association for the Arts for the recognition of distinguished Bucknell alumni in the Arts, chose Armstrong as their first member in the Visual Arts field. Armstrong sees this as a ""wonderful opportunity"" and a ""great honor"" and feels that ""Bucknell has the facilities and the ------ Courtesy of David Armstrong ""Ocean Gardener,"" pictured above, is one of the works of David Armstrong '69 to be on exhibit in the Center Gallery. ""David Armstrong: Twenty-Five Years of Painting"" will be on display through June 9. location to be a major contributor to the field of the arts,"" and it is essen tial that the importance of the arts and its students are recognized. His works cover a broad range of traditional American Realism subjects from portraits of his neigh bors and family to landscapes of Pennsylvania and the coast of Maine. ""The work is reflective of my direction in painting in terms of sub stance, subject, and medium over the last twenty-five years,"" says Armstrong, whose dedication and passion for painting is most evident in this exhibit. Armstrong's beautiful and re alistic landscape paintings inevitably emphasize the value and beauty of American land which is quickly dis appearing. Armstrong does not want to dictate one specific environmen tal message with his paintings but instead wants the viewer to decide and ""take away from the exhibit what he wants."" Armstrong did, however, speak of the ""frightening alienation"" that we have from the land in our modem world and said, ""if people leave the exhibit with some connection or concern with the planet, I'll be happy."" Armstrong will be present for an opening reception in the gallery on Saturday, April 27, from 5 to 7 p.m. There will also be a gallery talk on Saturday, May 4, from 3 to 5 p.m. in the gallery, at which time Armstrong will speak about his work and answer any questions that view ers might have. The Center Gallery, on the third floor of the Langone Center, is open to the public 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. on weekdays, and 1-4 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday."
W hat's new on video?,
The Witches,"By Marc Haimes StaffWritcr Based on the children's book by Roald Dahl, ( Charlie And The Chocolate Factory, James And The Giant Peach ) The Witches is a won derfully exciting and surprisingly scary adventure. Most of the movie takes place in an Austrian hotel"
Br K,
a p,
A r,"where a hesitant eight year old boy, John, and his tough, yet loving, nanny have decided to take a relax ing vacation. The boy soon discov ers, however, that hordes of witches from all over the world have met at the hotel fora secret convention. The witches are secretly plotting to turn all children into MICE. Something must be done! In a delightfully spooky mo ment, John spies on the huge clan of witches from behind a table as they remove their ""human"" disguises and turn into comically disgusting mon sters. The film is filled with enough close-calls and near misses to keep any child's attention for the entire film. There arc also some subtle moral messages, characteristic of Roald Dahl, addressing such unat tractive qualities as selfishness and greediness. The film is brimming with acerbic ironies and poetic jus tice. The movie also offers some pleasant surprises for parents or older brothers and sisters. Anjelica Houston gives a superbly evil per formance as the sadistic head witch. ""Vitchcs!"" she shouts in a menacing German accent, ""Dcr isss a CHILD in our presence!!!"" The puppetry by Jim Henson and the unique photog raphy arc brilliant. At risk of giving away one of the many twists of the film, Henson's manipulation of real istic looking small animals is not ""chccsy."" The Witches is rated PG. At times during the film, I wondered if this was an appropriate rating. Judg ing from the number of seven and eight year old hands clutching their armrests in terror, one might want to explain to younger children ahead of time that the somewhat gruesome make-up sported by the witches is just a special effect. One also might reinforce that witches do not really exist in real life. Or do they?"

Approaching greatness,
Bucknell surmounts problems and looks toward future.,"Universities across the nation are facing an ever more competitive future as the applicant pool starts to shrink and the cost of a private education continues to grow, but the future for Bucknell is amazingly bright. Under the leadership of President Gary Sojka, the University has expanded and improved over the past several years. Perhaps the most significant accomplishment has been the successful conclusion of the Campaign for Bucknell which added $90.9 million to the University's endowment. Construction on campus has also been a sign of the University's strong commitment to providing adequate facilities. Phase two of the new Science Complex, the $12 million Biology building, will pro vide improved facilities for the Biology department which is currently constrained in the outdated Taylor Hall. The Olin Science renovation and the new Chemistry Building arc also symbolic of Bucknell's new commitment to the natural sciences. The University is becoming a liberal arts institution with a distinc tively scientific flair. Similarly, the new Bison has helped to provide increased social space for students, and its many entertainment functions have been a welcome alternative source of social activity. The construction of the new Bison may also have alleviated much of the low morale that existed among students last semester. The University Counsel's overly cautious interpretation of Act 31, along with overzealous alcohol policy enforcement on behalf of Security, spurred a near riot last Halloween. Since then, the new Director of Security and Safety, Vince DcCerchio, has formulated a tough but fair enforcement policy and made the department more open to students. Morale no longer seems to be as problematic. Other staff changes also promise to bring fresh blood and new and innovative ideas to campus. Currently, many administrative positions arc being consolidated. For example, one of the special assis tants to the president will now be assuming the duties of two other administrators. While consolidation and efficiency are important, care must be taken not to overload administra tors. Such overloading might encourage capable employees to leave the University. The underlying problem with the cut in administration is the trustees' recent decision to minimize the increase in the comprehensive fee. A slim increase of only 4.5% has left the University scrambling for funds. While this may be a windfall for current students, the long-term ramifications are troubling. At the same time however, the greck system appears to be thriving once again. The debate over the fate of the system has now come to pass, despite some discontent with sophomore rush. Indeed, the Phi Kappa Psi house, which has been a scar on the face of Bucknell for nearly three years is promising to reopen next semester. The problem of crime, particularly vandalism, remains, however. In December, USA Today reported that Bucknell had the highest per capita crime rate of any university in the Commonwealth. Much of this high rate was attributed to Security's filling of reports on even minor incidents, but some of the blame must lie with an irresponsible student body. It is time for the University to take steps to reverse the trend toward higher crime-- releasing the names of students convicted of criminal activities to campus media organizations would provide a healthy deterrent. It is lime that our tuition dollars were put toward educa tion rather than replacing vandalized property. Bucknell also has made minor steps toward diversification. The STEP program has brought a num ber of non-traditional students to campus forthc Community College of Philadelphia. Bucknell has successfully surmounted a substandard endowment, controversy over the greek sys tem, and low student moral. Some problems still persist such as crime, vandalism, and budgetary con straints, but Bucknell now stands ready to become a unique and even more exceptional institution."

Parent angered about,
criticism of S.T.O.P.,"To the Editor: My daughter recently sent me a copy of the February 15th issue of the Bucknellian which contained a letter from Diane E. Oltorik to you about dramatic displays against the recent Gulf War. It is not my intention to initiate a ""republic of letters"" among parents, but I found the letter subversivcly, almost vis- ccrally, offensive to standard American val-"

S.T.O.P.,"Because the letter was written with uncanny rhetorical talent, it could pass for an authentic argu ment. The grammar rhythm, dic tion, the air of common sense and decency smuggled into the reader's brain by its savvy brush strokes, reminded me of Ronald Reagan's ability to convince us he could read. Upon close analysis, the letter gave off a sinister feeling, as sense of ingratiating manipulation, and after realizing it was authentic, that sentient people actually think this way, I felt very much as if I were launching at the Port Authority Bus Terminal. Ms. Oltorik offers up her daughter as a precious commodity tainted by free expression from other students. I worry if Janelle will be alright, what with her level gave and porcelain psyche hope lessly fragile to ostensive defini tions of war. You see, war IS death, but I guess we can't point it out. If my parents had presented me to an audience under the aegis of such a bull-jive protectorate, I would have cut them out of my will. To have suggested you support such shelter ing is, of course, political persua sion. To be fair, the letter did not condemn discussion of the GULF war. It just insisted the dis course occur in a particular form, and defines dramatic forms as irrational. Its argumentative con tent is just about below the level of any discussion. Why is it everyone has heard of # Shakespeare but not Ms. Oltorik? I could imagine, though, productions in the new and expensive Weis Center, narrated, but without scenes, lights, gesture, and animated dialogue. Curtain calls for implied actors. Why don't we have public criticism of the arts instead of the arts? You know, I often wonder if rationally discussing the choreography of war is worse than murder. Clearly the discourse recom mended by Ms. Oltorik requires baroque superficiality as a mode of truth, and it forms an eerie nexus of denial in the face of even simple reality. It implies we are only rhe torical, and that the public debate by the government wasn't tailored to induce us to believe in a macho sense of our own invincibility and See PARENT, p. 11"
Fraternity disturbed by,
lack of faculty support,"To the Editor: On April 16,1991, Tim Hartman, of U.S.P.C.I., and Clyde Peeling , of Organizations United for the Environment, engaged in a very informative discussion in which each gentle man presented information re garding the hazardous waste management facility that U.S.P.C.I. is proposing to build near Lewisburg. About 45 people, all students and towns people, attended the discussion, which was sponsored by the Social Awareness Committee of the Kappa Delta Rho Fraternity. In its most recent meeting the Bucknell faculty voted unani mously to take a position against the construction of the waste incinerator. We, the Social Awareness Committee of Kappa Delta Rho, find it somewhat odd that, after having adopted such a position, not one member of the faculty chose to attend the discus sion. Perhaps none of them had the free time to attend. Perhaps they all thought that they knew all there was to know regarding the issue and were unwilling to hear any more. Perhaps if the discussion had been sponsored by a group other than a fraternity, in other words, by a group against which the faculty bore no preju dice, some of the faculty would have attended. As it was, no faculty members were present at a function from which all of those who attended profited as they were exposed to conflicting perspectives on a controversial and important issue.

Prospective students and families time and again mentioned that contact with Bucknell students was a very meaningful part of the day. The weather on the day of the Open House was cold and drizzly, but the spirit and enthusiasm of the Bucknell students was warm and sunny. A very special thanks to all! Judy Compton Ellis Admissions Open House Coordinator April 18,1991 To the Editor: Hello, I am a male, white, Greek, heterosexual Bucknell stu dent. Have I offended you? Chances are, I probably have, which is not in the least bit surpris ing. These days, a person's mere existence can spark controversy and anger on this campus. We have a number of diverse groups here at beautiful Bucknell, each with its own specific agenda and/or (tm) mission. Nor mally, this is fine. However, the problem arises when one group claims superiority (in either purpose or idea) over that of another. This group, feeling that it is more ""cor- reel that the other, will sing its own praises while slandering those who might have a different view point. The problem greatly intensi fies when more than one group takes this self-righteous stance. The result: confusion, anger, and hypoc risy. This situation has recently arisen on our campus. The contro versy has centered around Jeans Day, and the emergence of a new group on campus. The players are well known to everyone: F.L.A.G., P.O.W.E.R., and the Ad Hoc Com mittee for Heterosexual Awareness. The result has been quite a nauseat ing scenario. Let us begin with the newest member of the fracas, the Ad Hoc Committee for Heterosexual Awareness. Evan Maloney, the organizer of this comrnftfce, says that the purpose of Heterosexual"

My question to Mr. Maloney and his cohorts is this: ""Is your purpose genuine?"" There has been some concern about the Ad Hoc Committee being linked to a group calling them selves F.A.G. (Friends of Aiti- _ ____ Gays). Mr. Maloney claims that there is no connection be tween the two, that FAG is merely a fictitious tag that some individual (or individuals) wrote on his group's - ^ _ _ _ advertisements. However, others claim that the two groups are, in fact, associated with one another, if not the same group all together. If the latter is the case, Mr. Maloney, then you are an incredibly ignorant individual. To begin with, choosing a name like F.A.G. is neither cute nor creative. It reveals you and your group to be nothing more than ill-informed homophobes who obviously have a lot of free time on your hands. Not only that, but your actions only make the situation worse. If you disagree with Jeans Day and what it stands for, then simply do not wear jeans on April 17, but don't make a mockery of what some feel to be a serious expression of their feelings.

Heterosexuals' bias causes campus tensions,"By Margaret E. Cronin University Writing Center, Tutor HOMOPHOBIA-- The irra tional fear or hatred of gay men, les bians, and bisexuals. HETEROSEXISM-- is the view that heterosexuality is the 'norm' for all social/sexual relation ships and as such the heterosexist imposes the model on all individuals through homophobia. S/he supports and /or advocates this continued in stitutionalization of heterosexuality in all aspects of society, including the denial of homosexual rights as a political concern. (Cherric Moraga, 1983.) Basically stated, heterosexu als have privileges and power over gays and lesbians that arc granted to them solely on the basis of their sexual orientation. In all the years that I've been working to raise awareness about homophobia at Bucknell, I've never seen a front page feature article on Jeans Day, until this year, when Jeans Day has also been proclaimed ""Heterosexual Pride Day"". Why is it that The Bucknellian rushes to cover a story about people tearing down signs that say ""Heterosexual Pride"
Eliminating prejudice will help,
solve world differences,"By Joyce Dollinger As I sat in my seat a week ago last Tuesday, listening to Allan Ryan, University Attorney at Harvard and guest speaker for the Annual Holocaust Memorial, speak about the legal and moral is sues of Nazi war criminals in America, all I could do was re member having to watch a docu mentary related to the Holocaust. I could barely sit through the movie, and for a long time after ward, I had nightmares. The dreams were so real that I could almost smell the gas and feel the heat of the crematoria; my stom ach churned from the stench of rotting bodies lying in open graves. In my dream, I could hear the words from the movie, ""Lest We Forget."" Then I wondered about the tens of thousands of people, whose cultures warned them not to forget. Throughout history, one group has exploited, killed or subjugated another group because of color, be lief, gender or nationality. Not only the Jews have been the victims. Blacks were kidnapped and enslaved by Europeans and Americans. The Native Americans were systemati cally forced from their lands, killed and finally relocated to ""reserva tions."" The same cruelty has been visited upon the Incas, the Mayans and the Aztecs at the hands of the Spanish. And let us not forget the American Japanese during World WarH. I wonder how many children arc truly taught of the Sand Creek Massacre; slave boats, chains and beatings; the stinking conditions of overcrowded detainment camps. How many have nightmares as the ones I used to have? Though we in some ways remember, we still seem to forget that prejudice has caused so much destruction. It persists. If I could change any one facet of human history, it would be to eliminate the fear and igno rance which lie at the root of prejudice. Imagine a world free of prejudice. Yes, I would eliminate prejudice so that no adult or his tory book would have to tell chil dren to remember, ""Lest We For get."" Thus, corruption and evil must give way to integrity and goodness. Since we all dwell on this earth, we must somehow be come one in spirit and one in friendship. Only then, will things change..."
Skena's,
Prescription,"By David Skena Why do prices seem so high in the Bison? I'm not the only one who has asked that question and I think the answer would benefit everyone who usually eats there. I don't want this column to be an attack on dining services. They do a fine job of feed ing everyone who is hungry and compared to other schools I've been to, the food is pretty good. My con cern is the cost attached to some items in the Bison and the seemingly discretionary price hikes of popular foods. Presumably, those in charge of pricing the items in the Bison have sound methods for doing so. I guess that there might be a standard mark up percentage. Additionally, prices are probably raised solely in re sponse to changes in wholesale costs. After all, Dining Services is here primarily to serve the Bucknell community , not to profit like a nor mal business. Since the New Bison has opened, I've been keeping track of some of the price changes and I'm perplexed. A pound of salad used to cost $1.90, now the price is $2.40 ( Up 26%). A chicken breast was 1.95,now it's $2.75 (U p41%). The soft pretzel, formerly an affordable little snack, was forty cents, now it brings in ninety-five cents (Up 137%). Other prices have also in creased but I think these examples arc enough to allow me to ask why this has happened. I didn't know that produce prices had risen so much or that a soft pretzel cartel just flexed its muscle. Are we in a highly inflationary period? I'm being sar castic but one can surely see how the average consumer could be con fused, especially when a pound of salad is still $1.99 at Weis Market. It is because I have confidence that all these pricing decisions were made fairly that I ask Dining Ser vices to inform students, faculty, support staff and administrators of price changes by noting price in creases with a simple asterisk on the chalkboard. It would also be nice if a curious individual could know why the change occurred. I think every one in the Bucknell community is intelligent enough to understand that when wholesale prices rise, retail prices follow. The only reason I could see anyone getting bent out of shape about a price change would be if pricing changes were made to sim ply increase a profit margin. I realize that the university de pends on the Bookstore and the Bi son to be revenue producers (That's half the reason they got remodeled) but to what extent should hungry stu dents be ""taxed"" for eating in their student center. The argument could be made that having the Bison over charge is good because it adds money to the general fund and there fore tuition to students is offset. I guess that's logical but I would still like to know where the highest mark ups are so that those students who are better off financially could eat the high profit items and help the struggling students, an honorable action indeed. One could also say that the Bison should be run like any other business and supply and de mand should be allowed to establish some equilibrium. I disagree. The Bison is not a real business. The Dining Service faces no real compe tition on this campus and the salaries of those running it are paid not by See SKENA, p. 13. Day... Sponsored by F.A.G.-- Friends of Anti-Gays"", but it has never been news when, for years now, signs simply advertising edu cational programs about homophobia, or fliers announcing meetings of support groups for les bians, gay men, and bisexuals, have consistently been tom down or de faced? It's not news until it involves heterosexuals, right? No Bucknell ian photographer ever featured FLAG or GAY AWARENESS signs with a caption describing how those signs were ripped down or defaced by ""vandals"". For too long now, the human rights of gay men/lcsbians/ bisexuals have not been newswor thy, while heterosexual freedom of speech is front page headline mate rial. Before I go further, let me say that I agree it is not good policy to rip down or deface anyone's signs no matter how offensive, ignorant, or misinformed the message may be. I certainly have felt like ripping these signs down, but choose not to. I choose not to because, in my past 10 years of trying to be a bridge be tween the gay/lesbian/bi community and the straight community, I have seen hundreds of gay supportive and anti-homophobia signs ripped down or defaced. I would not want to model behavior that I don't want perpetrated on me. It would have, however, made a big difference to me, and a lot of other gay men, les bians, bisexuals, if newspapers or administrators thought enough of our free speech to record the fact that we couldn't keep a flier on a bulletin board for more than a day or so. I'd like to address some prob lems I have with Evan Maloney's ""Ad Hoc Committee on Hetero sexual Awareness"", and his ad cam paign for ""Heterosexual Pride Day"" on Jeans Day. But before I get into that. I'd like to talk about the signs themselves. I realize it may be hard for some people to understand why other people get so freaked out by a few signs proclaiming heterosexual pride and awareness. Some people might think, ""What's the big deal?"" Some others might think, ""Well, I'm for heterosexual and homosexual rights, so what's wrong with signs calling for heterosexual pride?"" But the Heterosexual Pride Day signs are offensive and even scary to a lot of gay men, lesbians, bisexuals for a couple of reasons. First of all, the ones that said, ""sponsored by F.A.G., (Friends of Anti-Gays)"", are obviously problematic. It's scary to see sign exhibiting hostility towards part of your personhood, esp. when you live in a heterosexist/ homophobic culture in which your physical/emotional safety as well as your employment security, housing rights, and child custody are at risk. And second, the signs that did not use the ""F.A.G."" acronym, but which did advocate heterosexual pride or heterosexual awareness on Jeans Day, are disturbing on a more complex level. The ""F.A.G."" signs arc blatantly homophobic: they arc anti-, or against, a whole section of the population, and they make use of a derogatory term used to oppress gay men. I think it's pretty easy to see the problem with these fliers. But the signs which simply call for heterosexual pride or aware ness on a day designated to support civil rights of gay men, lesbians, and bisexual, arc of a different, though connected, order. Theses signs are examples of hctcrosexism. As a couple of people pointed out in let ters to the Bucknellian, every day is heterosexual pride day-- our culture revolves around heterosexuality as if heterosexuality were the only legiti mate reality despite the fact that at least 2,469,290 Americans do not share that reality. Despite how many gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals there arc in this country, heterosexu ality is still privileged as the norm. Sometimes, if you are a part of a privileged group in a culture, you get so used to your privilege that it becomes invisible to you. You think everyone has the same opportunities, or the same social/cultural support, that you do. I think this may be the case with the ""Ad Hoc Committee for Heterosexual Awareness"". Het erosexual orientation is already completely protected and sanc tioned, not just through our cultural values, but through our society's le gal system. If you're heterosexual, you don't have to fight a court battle to take your boyfriend or girlfriend to your prom. If you're heterosexual, your intimate relationships can be formally recognized through mar riage. If you're heterosexual, you don't have to worry about losing your job or your kids because of your See BIAS, p. 13."

Freshman defends,
A.H.C.H.A.'s actions,"To the Editor: ""Jeans Day,"" as this past 17 April was dubbed by members of F.L.A.G. was resounding victory for any student who wishes to express his or her opinion. We exposed the foes of free speech: ironically, they were the same people who last semester shouted the loudest for free speech. P.O.W.E.R., which had fought hard for ""chalk talk"" as a vehicle for free speech, sought to sup press us from using the same medium. When we used the me dium they thought were ""theirs,"" our messages were defaced. Epi thets such as ""homophobic"" were hurled against us. Yet, we never mentioned homosexuality in any of our flyers or chalk talks. We never took a stand for or against homosexuality. The same group wrote ""heterosexual"" on various sidewalks with slash marks through it. Would this be consid ered ""hetcrophobia?"" Would their attempt at silencing us be consid ered ""frccspcechophobia?"" In the article, P.O.W.E.R. said they were responding to our ""hate."" What hate? In saying that we support heterosexuality, arc we saying we hate anyone? Are the annual gay pride parades in New York City thought of as acts of hate against heterosexuals? P.O.W.E.R. was also quoted as saying what they had done to our notices was ""dia logue."" These people would prob ably call the Nazi book burnings ""literature appreciation."" Hussein's torching of hundreds of oil fields would be ""atmospheric modification."" Nice euphemisms, but Bucknellians are smarter than that. Lastly, a ""trained peer edu cator for homophobia"" says that A.H.C.H.A. ""feels threatened by Jeans Day."" We were never threatened enough to tear down their signs or attempt to suppress their speech. We may disagree, but 1 will fight for their right to speak as vehemently as I will for my own. They arc the ones who appear threatened by our speech. I want to thank you for presenting the article in a fair and objective manner. We felt the suggestion that students wear jeans and a lie was a good one. People can support right for ho mosexuals and still show support for heterosexuals. The ""contro versy"" was simply a matter of rights, of which speech is one, and A.H.C.H.A. supports the right guaranteed to all humans, not just heterosexuals. Evan Coyne Maloney '94 April 22,1991"

When I read Janellc was sent to Buckncll because it is a place with a ""history of conservative values;"" and when I heard the undertone of a veiled consumer threat, apparently spawned by a violation of Ms. Oltorik's buying ethic; I wavered between lassitude and hilarity. It was quite unreal. Bucknell certainly isn't -- -- Miss Buffy's finishing school, even if one holds conservative values, and I suggest the parent might be disabused by reading any simple- minded para graph on the notion of a university. It seems rather to be a case of consumer naivete, and her pitch calls to my mind Surreal Estate agents who hawk quietude in the suburbs of America, that generalized place where the waters of social order hold no Ripple. Let me substitute the follow ing for Ms. Oltorik's comments. I commend the school for its terrific faculty; my daughter has taken many deeply stimulating courses. But if Ms. Oltorik reflects Buck nell in any persistent way, I have been the naive consumer. I am disturbed by the absence of con tinuous, lively dissent on campus. It may be that Buckncll does not allow its ambience to be defined ENOUGH by serious, spirited, broadly styled expression. It might be construed, as might Ms. Oltorik's letter, to be a lethal fail ure of imagination. It has struck me during my many visits to campus also that there is a cathode ray mctaphysic fabricating the tone of the place. Courses cannot be the sole source of education. The environment has to foster a supportive depth also. It's not possible to survive with only a sit-com gesture, good will, and silly relativism. The university digs deeper, or it should. But, for example, the book store has deteriorated in seriousness over the past three years --Bill Cosby is the most visible philoso pher on display. The gene pool is also in danger from all that fluores cence. The Bison sells cigarettes even though everyone is taught in school that smok- ........ ing kills. The ""new"" Bison has nanosecond ""PINGS"" and a TV screen bigger than the Moon's schlong. I thought the entire place would read TILT when I walked in at the ribbon cut ting ceremony. How can there be _ _ rational discussion there? On what would Janellc level her gaze? Actually I did turn off the monster TV at the Grand Opening, but a supervisor told me it should remain on. I pointed out nobody was watching it. When she said they won't watch if it's off, I began to record my own pulse. I just sat like a catatonic robot on a day pass, groping to detect a flaw in her supervisory logic. But it was a real homey environment for feeling stunned. These conditions effect a serious dilution of the intellectual climate. How else could you possi bly account for the absence of massive outrage to the letter I've criticized? Shit, Gary, it castigated you for not squashing free expres sion because Janclle might get a tummy ache. Why aren't YOU outraged? Martin J. Kelly, Jr. April 12,1991"

"The Bucknellian,","Box C-3059, or use our convenient drop box in the"" ' basement of East Roberts Halt From page 10 plaud you (as well as apologize for the above). Showing genuine sup port for something you truly be lieve in is admirable. Just as the supporter of homosexuality has the right to wear jeans on Wednesday, so does the supporter of a hetero sexual life-style by wearing a coat and tie. I hope you are sincere, Mr. Maloney, because it would be a shame if you were not. Next, in this comer, we have F.L.A.G. and their supporters. The emergence of the Ad Hoc Commit tee for Heterosexual Awareness has sent these people into a panic- stricken frenzy. Zoe Ingram is ""scared."" Mary Swart and Peter Hormand are ""scared."" The whole world trembles as another pro- heterosexual group comes into existence. I can hear it now: 'To arms! To arms! The heterosexuals are coming! The heterosexuals are coming! WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE!!"" Relax... I think a new word should be added to the dictionary: ""Heterophobia."" What the hell are you so afraid of, and why are you so opposed to a group of people who wish to celebrate their hetero sexuality? Ms. Swart and Mr. Hormand ask the riveting question: ""Isn't every day heterosexual pride day?"" The answer for heterosexuals is yes, just as every day is homo sexual pride day for homosexuals, African American pride day for African Americans, and so on. If you are proud of yourself, your culture, your history, and your life style, then every day should be a day of pride for yourself. Gee, are Ms. Swart and Mr. Hormand im plying that only certain individuals should show pride in themselves? Golly, that sounds a bit self-righ teous, doesn't it? The two then ask why these individuals ""need to publicize their heterosexual pride?"" Good Lord, if I went up to a gay male and asked him why he doesn't stay in the closet, I'd be crucified within a matter of minutes. Are they trying to say that only certain people should exercise their free dom of speech or freedom of ex pression? My my, how hypocriti cal. Let's say, for the sake of argument, that Mr. Maloney and his companions are not sincere. What does it matter? One group of individuals can in no way threaten you, destroy your pride in yourself, or deter you from your goals. Wear you jeans, enjoy your life, and take care of yourself and those you care about. Heterosexual Bucknellians are not secretly planning the eradi cation of the homosexual commu nity. The whole world is not out to get you. Finally, we come to P.O.W.E.R. Boy, here's a coura- gcous lot! If Mr. Maloney achieved anything with his Heterosexual Pride Day campaign, he certainly exposed this group for what they arc. In order to publicize their views, the Ad Hoc Committee utilized fliers and ""chalk talk."" However, their ideas and opinions clashed with those of P.O.W.E.R.. So, how did they respond? Why, they responded in the most mature and sensible way they knew how: they tore down the fliers and scribbled over the chalk messages. Is this the way to defend your posi tion? What is even more hilarious is that an anonymous (shocker) member of P.O.W.E.R. actually called this an ""effective dialogue."" If mature responses had been writ ten either above, below, or beside the group's messages, then it would have been a dialogue. Scribblings and cross-outs, I'm sorry to say, are not. You say that you arc for equal ity, and that you want to be heard. Does this mean at the expense of others? P.O.W.E.R. wishes us to believe that they are serious, pow erful organization, dedicated to their case. Let me ask you a ques tion then: Why is it that you choose to remain anonymous? Is it that you arc afraid of persecution? If that is your excuse, then please look upon Mr. Ingram to reveal your weak ness. I personally do not condone homosexuality, but one has to re spect Mr. Ingram for standing up and fighting for what he believes in. He has risked a great deal by revealing his true identity to the world. However, he did so because he believed in himself and in his words. So, P.O.W.E.R., your cow ardice leads me to two conclusions. Either you aren't for real, and your entire existence here on campus ha: been one big joke, or you are em barrassed at yourselves. Politically and socially ""correct"" martyrs are a dime a dozen these days. If you have something important to say to the world, then say it, but not while hiding behind a piece of chalk. So what has been the result ol all of this? Heterosexuals have come out of their closets, homo sexuals and bisexuals arc running for cover, feminists are buying up all the chalk they can get their hands on, and the average Buck- ncllian just can't find a thing to wear. What do we do? On a serious note, just be yourself. Don't link yourself to one particular group or another. Chances are, they're wrong. Start your own group, be the only member, and have your own ""Pride Day."" Personally, I think I might just stay in my room for a few days until this whole thing blows over. Then again, I'd probably offend someone. Darren L. Shaw '91 April 17,1991"
Lesbian reacts to student's letter,"To the Editor: Last Friday, Dave Vosseller wrote to the Bucknell ian to express his discomfort with being judged for wearing or not wearing jeans on Jeans Day. I agree with Dave -- judg ing people for their attire on that day is a seductively easy trap to fall into. And, like Dave, I too have caught myself making those judgements. Because I think this kind of ""keeping score"" is usually uninformed and almost always unfair, I try to assume that everyone does what he or she needs to on that day. I've talked to Christian friends whose struggles are similar to Dave's. And I've known gay men and lesbians who've not worn jeans on Jeans Day because it's just too scary; it feels too visible for them to do so. So I appreciate the spirit in which Dave's letter is written. It is difficult, then to read on and find Dave making his own judgments on ""homosexual acts"", as he terms them. Part of Dave's letter goes like this: ""All humans have orientations, that, if acted upon and carried out are wrong; to lie, to steal, to harm another person, and the homo sexual act is not worse than any of these acts, it is the same."" To start with , Dave, I'm not quite sure what you mean by the ""homosexual act"". As a lesbian, I am not defined simply by the sexual act, any more than you would be defined solely by your ""heterosexual acts"" with a woman. Furthermore, I cannot accept your categorization of ho mosexuality with lying, stealing, and harming other people. To do so would be an act of self-hatred on my part, an act of total disrespect for who I am and how I live and love in this world. My desire for women is about love, about fundamental human connection, about spiritual ity. It is not simply about a single ""act"" in bed. Such a reduction of my personhood is unfair. Dave, point (and I'm not saying this is conscious or malicious -- but it is insidious) is a myth much of our culture operates under, a myth that goes something like this: Straight people make love, gay people have sex. If you think back a little in U.S. history, you'll see that this is a recycles formula, once cast in racial terms to justify the rape and abuse that white people perpetrated on Africans, Native Americans, and other peoples of color. (That's"
"""And I think",
"it is the lesbian in me, the intensely",
"woman driven part of myself, that is the",
well-spring of my,
"spirituality.""","imagine if you were really in love with a woman, and the two of you had built a relationship together that was the most important thing in the world to you. Maybe you're in such a relationship now, or maybe this is the kind of relation ship you see your parents in. In any case, imagine that you're in this kind of loving, supportive, sustain ing connection with a woman, and someone comes along and equates this most important thing in your life with lying, stealing or harming other people. How would you feel? What if people told you that it's okay to feel like you're in love with this woman, but it would be wrong to act out a relationship with her? What would you do? I think behind Dave's view- another story, of course, but not unrelated. Our country's power structure depends upon scapegoats, and has used a variety of categories by which to scapegoat groups of disenfranchised people, including religion, sexual orientation, class, gender, race, and ethnicity). I truly believe that god put us on this earth to love as best we can. And s/he gave us all kinds of ways to express that love. I believe that spirituality is developed through love and compassion. And 1 think it is the lesbian in me, the intensely woman driven part of myself, that is the well-spring of my spirituality. My relationships with women have been a sacred thing in my life. My lesbianism is not only about sex; nor is it just one interchangeable ""piece"" of my personality. It is not a removable part of my iden tity. I am just as much a lesbian in the library or the Bison or on the quad as I am in bed. My en tire personhood is suffused with my lesbianism, and were I never to have sex (the ""homosexual act""?) with another woman for the rest of my life, I would be no less a lesbian for that fact. I'll end by saying that I think it's dangerous to think that we can separate any one part of ourselves out from another. I believe that our sexual selves are very much connected to our emo tional selves, our rational selves, our physical selves, our spiritual selves. My sexuality is informed by my spirituality, just as my spirituality is informed by my sexuality. It's when we start compartmentalizing ourselves and cutting ourselves into little pieces that we open the door for dehumanization. Whether we are gay, lesbian, bisexual, or straight, our sexual orientation is not about who we sleep with, but about who we fall in love with. Our orientation comes from love, which is the most intense, life- centered energy we experience as human beings. It is disrespectful and tragic to think that any of us should try to suppress the very energy we need to sustain our health as physical and spiritual beings. Margaret E. Cronin April 21,1991"

Skena,"phasize that these were indeed the first signs to go up, as members of the student body, support staff, and administration can attest to.

(Esposito's piece ran on the front page of the Daily Item Satur day, April 13. Unlike The Bucknell ian, the Daily Item chose to feature homophobia, rather than hetero sexual free speech, as the issue.) While there have been 3 or 4 different versions of the ""Hetero sexual Pride Day"" signs, all in the campaign. Now, perhaps Evan Maloney's ""Ad hoc Committee for Heterosexual Awareness"" started its ad campaign shortly after ""F.A.G."" did, and perhaps this ad hoc group just happened to use the same work ing, same formatting, and same par enthetical phrasing that appeared in prior to the What's Happening ad which announced, for the first time, the ""Ad Hoc Committee for Hetero sexual Awareness"", no dialogue with the people behind the signs was possible.

As many know, cooking in the residence hall rooms is prohibited by Residential Life. Once again, I know that cvcry- onc is doing their job and that no one intends any malice in their ac tions.

He claims that someone tore his original signs down, added ""F.A.G."" to discredit his ""Ad-hoc Committee for Hetero sexual Awareness"". Anyone who was paying attention to the bulletin boards know differently. It was, in fact, the ""F.A.G."" signs that heralded the ""Heterosexual Pride Day"" ad Heterosexual Awareness."" We'll never know for sure, because for about a week, these signs appeared anonymously. The first signs (bear ing the name ""F.A.G"") hit the bulle tin boards on April 3rd. The other signs, with the same messages but no ""F.A.G."" tag, appeared 2 or 3 days later. It wasn't until April 11, when What's Happening ran the ""Hetero sexual Pride Day"" ad, that anyone could access Evan Maloney as a con tact person behind the ""Heterosexual Pride Day"" fliers. During that week homophobia plastered all over the bulletin boards by proud, ""invisible"" heterosexuals, some of whom were openly proclaiming themselves ""anti-gay.""

Freshman flies over Lewisburg,"By Sean McCarthy Have you ever wondered what it would be like to fly? To have the freedom to wander the blue skies at will? Maybe you've dreamed about what it would be like to have your own personal plane at your disposal? For mechanical engineering major John Shuttleworth '94, these things aren't a dream. In fact, John has his own Piper A ttow -4 , a four-seat, one- propeller passenger plane, parked at an airstrip in Lycoming. He flies at least three times a month, or when ever he gets a chance. But how did he get involved in the world of avia tion? Flying was a part of John's life from the moment he was bom. His father, a high-tech electronics sales man, learned how to fly planes for his business. Shuttleworth Inc. transported various types of automa tion equipment all over the country. Not only did John's father use planes for business, but he also took the family on vacations in them. In fact, as an infant, John would actually ride with his father on these trips in a small, specially-designed crib on the family plane. John grew up with airplanes, getting as much experience and guidance from his father as he could. He learned many of the ins and outs of the design, production, mainte nance and operation of airplanes. Finally, when he was 18, John ap plied for his pilot's license. He ex plains, ""It's not that hard; there are basically four steps you have to complete, though not in any specific order. You need 40 hours of flight experience, 20 with an instructor, and 20 solo...then an FAA flight in spector takes you up and has you do certain necessary maneuvers: taking off, landing, and keeping control of the plane...Finally, you have to pass a written test based on all the rules and regulations of the sky..."" Due to the success of the Shuttleworth's business, John's fa ther decided to buy more planes. At the latest count, the family owns four. Therefore, when John came to Bucknell, he was able to bring one of them with him. While the Piper is good for travel, and gets fairly good gas mileage, it is not able to execute many acrobatic maneuvers. Back home in Huntington, Indiana, the Shuttleworths have an old World War II trainer called an AT-6G. Nicknamed ""The Texan,"" this plane is very maneuverable, and according to John ""a lot more fun."" John and his father restored ""The Texan"" to working order about six years ago. It flew fairly well, but there were several small hidden flaws. After several further restora tions, it now flics with no trouble at all. However, in ""The Texan,"" John had one of his closest calls. Right after John and his father had first restored the plane, they decided to mSSA i l l T - __"

John explained that when you are doing such complicated maneu vers in a 600 horsepower plane, it is important to keep the plane stabi lized. However, since his father was still learning how to do high-gravity barrel rolls, he was not able to keep the plane as steady as he would have liked. As a result, a series of vibra tions caused John's canopy to ex plode. The two were able to safely land the plane, and as John explains, ""It wasn't too bad...it just got a liule windy up there for awhile."" At Bucknell, John pursues his aviation interests not only by flying his Piper three times a month, but also by collaborating with a Buck nell professor to build an ultralite plane. In the productions lab in the basement of Dana Engineering, John works with Project Development Laboratory Supervisor George Waltman on both design and assem bly of the ultralite. They hope to have the plane done by summer, but it's up in the air who will actually have the bravery to fly it. In the near future, John is thinking about setting up a local shuttle service to nearby cities. Be fore he does so, he'll need to get his commercial flying license which will allow him to charge people for trips. He anticipates that he will be flying people to New York, Phila delphia, Boston, Pittsburgh and other cities. After college, one of the things John wants to pursue first is a short career with the Air Force. ""I want to fly high performance jets while I'm still young...it won't be much fun when I'm 50."" When asked what flying meant to him, John paused and sat back, ""That's a tough question be cause it does mean a lot to me, I mean, I just enjoy sitting around talking about [flying]...! have been"

"Just in time, cherry trees magically bloom",
Do they sense that it's Parents ' Weekend?,"um By Sue Basalla Staff Writer Ever notice that the campus changes its appearance before Spring Weekend each year? Just in time for visiting parents and alumni, the cherry trees on the quad burst into bloom and full-grown daffodils suddenly pop up in places that you never saw them before. Does this spontaneous out door accessorization seem a little too coincidental to you? Does Bucknell really hire people to paste cherry blossoms on trees in the dead of night? According to campus folklore, Physical Plant employees spray the cherry trees with a mysterious chemical each spring in order to coax the buds into flowers at the ap propriate time. But is there any truth to this legend? Frankly, no. George Trepp, who handles all horticulture for the Physical Plant, reports that the tree trunks, not the branches, are indeed sprayed around this time of year. The oil spray prolongs the life of the trees, he said, by killing a bore in sect that lives in the bark. Trepp added, however, that if the spray touches the buds, they too will be destroyed. So, the myth couldn't be farther from the truth. Right: The cherry trees on the Academic Quad have not yet bloomed, but, as soon as parents arrive, flowers will mysteriously appear.

Management 101: The big sell,
"Populor course teoches ""efficency, effectiveness ond community""","By Susan Smith Staff Writer The students behind the table in the Langonc Center lobby look anxious to please. In front of them they have stacks of boxers, or T- shirts, or maybe Chipwiches. In the back of their minds, they harbor vi sions of service projects which de pend on the sale of the boxers and thoughts of the final presentations to the Board of Directors that are scheduled to take place in three weeks. Some potential customers pass quietly by the tables, while others stop to examine the products of this semester's Introduction to Organization and Management classes. Many of these customers can relate to the excitement and worries that fill the minds of the salespeople since they are them selves alumni of one of the most popular courses at Bucknell Univer sity, MG 101. When MG101 alumna Kate Fink'93 walked through the LC and saw the tables, she remembered try ing to sell ""bottle sleeves"" in the fall. According to Fink, ""It was a trying experience. I wanted people to buy our product because they liked it, but I also just wanted to sell them. We tried not to be pushy, but there was always the stress of not selling out and not being able to finance our ser vice project. At the end of the se mester though, I was sad to dissolve my company. We had become very close through the experience."" Madeliennc Casagrandc '91, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of this semester's Company B, admit ted, ""There is a lot of stress involved. My frustration level was very high at the middle of the semester. Our operation plans were due right after Spring Break and these pre-controls, when the loan proposal is approved or rejected, decided whether we made it through the rest of the se mester."" Scott Pericelli '94, CEO of Company D, also felt the pressure. He said, ""Getting everything orga nized was the most difficult part. You were all depending on each other, but you didn't know everyone that well yet, and didn't really know if it would all get done."" Welcome to the world of or ganization, leadership, and MG101! Because Professor of Management John Miller felt that students needed to learn organizational skills and de velop leadership traits, he developed this ""hands-on"" course. He felt that some human interaction skills just couldn't be taught in a textbook, (see sidebar this page) Miller also felt that all liberal arts students, not just business ma jors, should be exposed to the basics of management. Thus, MG101 is a course primarily designed for sec ond-semester freshmen and first-se mester sophomores. Each class be comes a ""company,"" composed of thirty to forty students who organize themselves into five divisions- Ser vice, Business, Human Resource Management (HRM), Report, and Finance. The company members elect a CEO and Vice-Presidents for each division. Phil Elliot '93, Vice-President of HRM for last fall's ""Campus Cheekwear"" remembered the job placement as one of the most diffi cult tasks. He recalled, ''There were many conflicts of interest because everyone wanted to work in Busi ness and no one would choose to work in Report. I had to devise a fair way of placing everyone in jobs and keeping them happy. When, for the sake of success of the company, Dave Scott ['93] volunteered to head the Report Division, everyone was so relieved."" Company members arc also relieved when the business and ser vice projects arc determined. For two weeks, students brainstorm ideas ranging from Bucknell male and female of the month calendars to final exam survival kits to shotglasscs. Scott Pericelli of Company D says, ""We debated between food and Guatemalan multi-colored woven belts. (Company member) Frank Casey ['93] was very high-spirited about doing something different so we voted for the belts and named ourselves, ""Dare to Be Different."" The service projects that the four companies chose to devote their time and profits to this semester are cleaning up the Bull Run River in Lewisburg, working with the elderly, throwing a party for foster children and their siblings, and helping the Mifflinburg and Lewisburg food banks. Prof. Miller commented, ""Some think that it's (MG101) orga nized around the service project be cause we're a bunch of do-gooders."" Actually, service projects are central to MG 101 because ""organizations exist to make a difference in others' lives."" Also, it was only once there were two departments- Service and Business- that some ""really interest ing organizational things began to lake place.' It takes skill to coordi nate the two projects. Every company faces some great crisis during the course of their semester. Company B of last fall thought that they had a very timely T-shirt when they designed the logo ""BU-Dry"". Then the ""Halloween Riot"" took place and Bucknell was no longer ""dry."" Luckily for them, Vince DcCcrchio of the department of security bought a large number of the T-shirts as a memento of how Bucknell used to be. Miller says, ""There are no 'best' companies. All companies have very interesting problems; their success depends on how they solve them."" Bucknell Mad Hatters of the Fall of 1988 experienced problems with their supplier. The contract didn't specify who was responsible for damaged hats. Success also depends upon adhering to two key ""Millerisms"". The first is: ""The probability that May 15 will fall on May 15 is very high,"" meaning that meeting dead lines is crucial. The second is,"" The world has seen more than enough organizations that run efficiently but shouldn't be done at all."" Miller explained, ""Successful companies ask themselves, 'What do my cli ents need from me?"" They don't develop a product that the company wants, but rather one that their tar geted consumer group will like."" And buy. Bankruptcy is a possibility for companies who do not work out their problems and cannot sell their product. This has only happened twice in the history of the program, however. Miller explains that when a company fails it,""files a Chapter 7 paper, consults the Business Law professors, appoints a trustee, and turns over the remaining inven tory."" But usually, Miller said, ""It simply doesn't take all that much effort to get them to manage them selves.... I'm stunned every se mester at the degree to which these students come to own these projects."" Kim Maxwell '93 of this semester's Chipwich company would agree. She said, ""The com pany is hard to separate from real life because you get so caught up in it...You don't want to let your co workers down."" Celebrations take place when everyone comes together to ac complish a goal. Casagrandc said, ""We were ecstatic after selling out of Chipwiches. The next working session we brought in some of the more undesirable Chipwiches- the ones that had melted when a freezer broke down- and had a party with our T. A.s."" A traditional company party takes place after the oral presenta tion to the board and the handing- over of the company archives, which include company newslet ters, minutes, financial statements, market research, contingency plans, and financial statements. Prof. Miller usually joins in the celebra tion. All of these late-night efforts have their effects. Paul Kahn '91 said, ""Management is like having a freshman hall all over again. You establish friendships and ties that last long beyond the solvency of your company."" Miller summed up, ""I find that 2 or 3 years afterwards the memories are still vivid. MG 101 leaves an impression.""

Professor Miller,
manages MG 101,"By Susan Smith Staff Writer ""I'm the only man who has ever served as the chairman of the board of 87 companies,"" smiles Professor of Management John Miller, as he explains the history of Management 101 (MG 101), a course he brought to Bucknell 13 years ago. Miller conceived the idea for the introductory management course while teaching at Yale University. At the time his upper- division class was working on mini-projects. It was on a day in 1976, which Professor Miller still vividly recalls, that he realized the strong need for an introductory management course for liberal arts students. A woman who was then a senior at Yale remarked to him that day that, ""She had been living with a manager for about 20 years without having the slightest idea of what he did, or why."" Miller real ized ""something very, very im portant. These people (that he taught) would be leaders sometime in their life. Inevitably they would be called upon."" All students needed to learn how ""emotionally engaging, how interesting it is to work with other people."" In the fall of 1977, Yale up perclassmen could elect to try Miller's new management course. Remembering the first year of MG101, Miller said, ""It was one of Yale's and my personal leach ing disasters. Inventing everything from scratch was one of the most painful experiences. It was very difficult. Students need structure, clarity, deadlines. Thank goodness I had very patient and bright stu dents. We tried again the next time without being so radical."" A year later, Miller received a call from Bucknell. At the time, Courtesy of Public Relations Bucknell had the standard three- day-a-wcck lecture class taught in Vaughan Literature Auditorium. In the fall of 1979, though, the pilot MG 101 class entertained the cam pus with a Casino Night. At the beginning, companies chose to ei ther work on a business or service project. Starting in the fall of 1982, companies were required to de velop a business project which would in turn finance a service project. Also in that year, the Board of Directors began to assess a 10% income tax of revenues to cover bankruptcies. M iller's MG101 course, which has been improved again and again over the years with the help of his colleagues, is now be ing copied at other universities. This spring, Clarkson University adopted the Bucknell model after observing MG 101 last fall. Their upperclassman division is ""exactly MG101."" Miller said proudly, ""They use my textbooks, the same mission statement, even the same grading system."" John Carroll University's carefully controlled comparison of Miller's course with the standard introductory lecture showed that the students clearly preferred the ""hands-on"" method. The MG 101 formula proved to be a much more successful way of teaching the dynamics of organi zation and leadership. Numerous publications about MG 101 have been printed as well. This month the Journal of Management Education , which Miller said is the ""number one journal in the field,"" featured an article on the MG 101 method. This summer, Miller will travel to France and Eastern Eu rope to present the course to Eu ropean educators. Commented Miller, ""The Bucknell model is rapidly becoming well-known, not only nationally, but abroad."""

Bison Tales,"By Marc Haimes Staff Writer We were required to print our names neatly on the brown bags brimming with lunchtime goodies from home. It was a strictly enforced 'Camp Wilder ness' rule. This way, no cunning camper could claim the cupcake and cheese-curls for his own, un less his cognomen matched the signature on the container. How ever, there was another more malicious reason for this rule... Everyday, after lunch, cer tain counselors would collect the lunch bags that were not properly placed in a trash basket but rather carelessly flung on the ground. They would then stroll to the an nouncement pavilion and scorn fully shriek out each name scripted on the offending parcels. The embarrassed litterbug would then have to get up and retrieve the bag in front of every kid in the entire camp. Observers would smugly stare and monotoncly croon, ""cwwwwwwwww."" (As in ""ewww you're innnnn troubleeeeee."" Not like ""euwwww gross."") This squash ing punishment would blemish untidy felons with a dull shame that not even free swim could wash away. Certain kids were so petri fied of the aforementioned hu miliation that they would cram entire sandwiches in their mouth, rush to throw their bag away, and then stand guard by the bin for the remainder of lunch to make sure it stayed inside. Camp Wilder ness quickly became the cleanest camp in the country, maybe even the world. As the campus administra tion makes the decision about whether to publish the names of students guilty of violations, I beg them to note that the above story could easily be translated into modem terms.... Suppose Joe, an average Buckncll student, decides one Saturday night that he is going to strip off all his clothes and run around naked shooting out win dows with a B.B. gun. Editor's Note: We wish to stress to perus ing parents that something this ludicrous could never really happen at Bucknell, but the au thor is using this obviously exag gerated example to make a point. Well, if Joe's name were not made public, then at some later date he might actually decide to do the same thing again. Perhaps he'll get tired of windows and move on to leash-less dogs or pe destrians. However, if Joe's ac tions, his name, and perhaps even a picture of the broken windows or the offending moon arc published immediately, he would suffer countless negative effects on his social life... Female Student #1: Hey, there goes Joe in that raincoat. Did you know he's a double major in astronomy and military science? He's really cute and I like the way he dresses. Female Student #2: Are you joking? Slay away from him! Didn't you hear what Joe did last night... whisper, whispcr.whisper. Female Student #1: Ewwwwwwwwwwwwww. Joe's classroom perfor mance would be affected as well... Joe: Sorry that I couldn't come to class on Monday, Profes sor. I had a real bad cold. Professor: A cold? Really? Gccce? I can't imagine how you could have acquired a cold. Per haps it has something to do with"
THE FACT THAT YOU WERE,
RUNNING AROUND CAMPUS,
COMPLETELY NAKED ON,
SATURDAY NIGHT PLAYING,"WITH YOUR GUN!!! Entire Class [in unison]: Ewwwwwwwwwwwwwww. Joe: Oh yeah. Maybe that's why, new that you mention it. I think it would be safe to say that if Joe had any sense left in his B.B. sized brain, he would probably stifle his next urge to practice gunnery in the buff. Other students, observing Joe's social plummet, would think twice be fore exhibiting their own marks manship skills. Now perhaps John Dunlop truly believes what he so simply slated in last week's Bucknellian: ""There is no evidence that pub lishing one's name in a newspaper serves as a deterrent to repeated misbehavior on the part of the in dividual or that it deters others from engaging in the same or similar misconduct. One would hope that would be the case and that appears to be the paramount argument for full disclosure...However, there sim ply is no data to support a deter ring aspect to this practice."" But as a child who spent his summer lunchtimes frantically eyeing waste pails with a bad case of ner vous indigestion, I would beg to differ."

All-nighters paralyze your brain!,
Campus psychologist and physician offer advice on academics,"By Lisa Lipari Staff Writer Joe Student has a test tomor row. He's freaking out. There seems to be no choice but to stay up all night studying. Joe later realizes that this was a big mistake and wonders if it's because he can hardly think, or because he fell asleep during his exam... Joe is not alone. He knows this because all of his classmates had that same glassy-eyed, incoherent ex pression at the exam. As a matter of fact, all-nighters are pretty common on college campuses. Maybe if Joe had kept up with his work during the semester he wouldn't have had to pull an all- nighter. But he, like college students everywhere, finds it easier to pro crastinate than to study each night. It's not that students intentionally avoid studying their notes or text books. It's just easier to complete written assignments that will be col lected (like term papers, labs, etc...). So while a student is constantly working, he or she can still fall be hind. The most common reason fora student to procrastinate is because the subject matter may not be all that interesting to the student. Joe, for example, may find it easier to study philosophy rather than physics be cause he likes philosophy better. There are some students who stay up all night studying because they are perfectionists and no matter how much they study, it's never enough. (This is not Joe.) If there is still another page to read, another note to take or another table to memorize, they will not rest until it is done. Of course perfection is un attainable, and these people, like the procrastinators, will soon figure out that all-nighters are not the way to go. If a student stays up all night writing a paper, watches it print out as the sun comes up, and then turns it in, the finished product is done, and the student can then relax. But the student who was up all night ""preparing"" for an exam is not yet done; there's still the exam to con tend with. Unfortunately, Joe was fighting a losing battle because not only did he stay up all night to study, he had to take an exam which re- which further decreases the student's ability to perform well on the exam. While Joe would never use anything other than coffee to stay awake, many students use products such as Vivarin, NoDoz, and other ""alertness aids."" Dr. J. Preston Hoyle, director of student medical services, said that some students use weight reduction pills and even am phetamines to stay awake. Said Hoyle, ""I tend to sec the people who quired thinking and reasoning. Most exams at Bucknell re quire analytical thinking, assessing problems, and problem solving, rather than rote memorization. A student may know the information by heart and still do poorly on the exam. This is because few students integrate lecture notes with the text or with the main concepts of the course. Having studied all night, a student may become frustrated if he or she can't remember the informa tion just studied hours before; this may then cause the student to panic, have problems."" He explains those problems and then tells them how they can avoid the problem alto gether. He also explained that the negative physical effects caused by alertness aids can come at the most inopportune lime, such as during an exam. Hoyle added that ""the student's tolerance [to such aids] in creases to a point at which they don't work."" Rosaria Gabriele, Assistant Director of Psychological Services for Outreach, feels that there is a strong connection between the mind and the body, and that when the mind becomes stressed the body becomes stressed as well. Students who frequently pull all-nighters feel that there just aren't enough hours in the day, and may feel over whelmed by their workload. While some students are more able to handle all-nighters than others, ""students should get at least two or three hours of sleep [before an exam],"" said Gabriele. During this time the brain can process the infor mation studied and store it for later use. When students stay up more than one night a week, they can ex perience sleep deprivation and may become irritable, less patient and less able to concentrate, according to Gabriele. According to Hoyle, ""You incur a debt, a sleep debt; you don't pay that debt with one night's sleep."" Asked about special strate gics for coping with finals week, professionals agree that students should study for an exam, take it, take a nap, and then do something unrelated for a short while. While studying for exams, it is usually best to study for a while, take a short break, and then begin studying again, although different methods work differently for different people. Joe, for example might study for an hour, take a five or ten minute break, and then hit the books again. Although everyone (includ ing Joe) has heard the same advice given time and time again, and even though it's true, most people don't follow it. So the advice to these stubborn, I've-always-done-it-this- way students is to study hard, but don't stay up all night. Either get some sleep before your exam or do something totally unrelated. Or call Joe."
Dining Out :,
Special Parents',
Weekend Guide to Restaurants,"By Steve Hoerter and Julie Bachman Staff Writers Bon errr... Appetite As a service to our readers, we, the god and goddess of dining, have compiled a special dining guide for Spring Parent's Week end. Enjoy. Breakfast Perkin's (Route 15, Lewis- burg) provides the ""franchise ap proach"" to breakfast, featuring the standard egg dishes at moderate prices. Good Will's Restaurant (Route 45, Montandon) offers a very Central Pennsylvanian cul tural experience. Local farmers and fishermen dine and talk plows and lures in the early hours of the morning until the college ""hang over"" rush takes over around noon. The food is fantastic and the prices you simply cannot beat! The Lewisburg Hotel (Market St., Lewisburg) serves breakfast in a much more formal and civilized atmosphere. Located in the heart of downtown Lewisburg, it's a convenient stop before the spring football game. Brunch Sunday brunch is a real treat at Peking Gardens Chinese Res taurant (Route 15, Lewisburg). A large buffet service geaturcs egg rolls, sweet and sour chicken, fried rice, chicken and brocolli, beef lo mein, shrimp with steamed veg etables and free chopsticks for all! Lunch Lickety Split (Market St., Lewisburg) is a lot more than an ice cream store -- they offer excellent croissant sandwiches, quiches, sal ads and soups. And, of course, there's lots of ice cream for dessert! The Bull Run Inn (""The Bar"") and the Towne Tavern (Mar ket St., Lewisburg) offer excellent burgers and sandwiches at reason able prices. If you want a brew with your lunch, ""The Bar"" and ""Tavern"" hold two of the coveted liquor li censes in town. If you want to grab a quick bite to cat without leaving campus, the Bison is always a good bet for this, that and the other thing. Plus, you'll be supporting Hank and his pals in Dining Services! Dinner Harry's Grille (20 W. Main St., Bloomsburg), located in down town Bloomsburg, is worth the half- hour trip from Lewisburg. The at mosphere is semi-formal and the menu boasts a wide selection of beef, chicken and seafood entrees. Entrees range from $9 to $20. Scarlet D's (Mifflinburg), Front St. Station (Sunbury) and Rusty's (Lewisburg) all offer a nice selection of moderate to mid-prices entrees. Reservations are generally not needed. B J's Ribs, located in Selinsgrove, is an excellent spot for barbecued ribs, chicken and other animal parts. A recent renovation gives BJ's a relaxing atmosphere. Ghezzi's and Shannon's, both on Route 60 in Sunbury, are lesser-known alternatives to be tried when everything else is booked. Ghezzi's has excellent Italian fare, while Shannon's highlights rare simulated-wood carpeting and an excellent chicken dish with peaches and cream. The Temperance House, located on North Second Street in Lewisburg, offers a smoke-filled atmosphere and waitresses with questionable temperament! 'The House"" is the hotbed of Univer sity politicking on Friday nights and the food is quite tasty indeed. ""Be seen"" at the Temperance House, and be sure to take your own Pollenex air purifier!"

Bison split twinbill with Susquehanna,
Roger Ahrens 91 named Patriot League Player of the Week as Bucknell takes two of three from Lehigh,"By Jon Terry Staff Writer The Buckncll University baseball squad took advantage of yesterday's picture perfect weather to gain a double-header split with Susquehanna. After a moderately successful 3-2 homestand this week, the Bison's record now stands at 17- 11 - 1 . Last Saturday Buckncll swept Lehigh 6-2 and 9-5 and were rained out Sunday before succumbing, 6-2, to the Engineers in the make-up game on Tuesday. This was a par ticularly disappointing loss since Lehigh came in with a miserable 1-7 conference record, 5-13 overall. The loss to 6-19 Susquehanna was also disappointing, although the Bison did rest many of their regulars against the Division II Crusaders. Buckncll coasted to a 7-2 vic tory in the first game yesterday be hind the outstanding pitching of Jim Stevens '94. Making his first colle giate start, Stevens (2-0,1.98 ERA) hurled a seven-inning complete game allowing just two runs on six hits. The runs scored after the Bison had already given him a 7-0 cushion. The Bison scored twice in the first inning off the Susquehanna starter, John Walter, on an RBI single by Roger Ahrens '91 and an RBI double by Mark Kennedy '92. Steve Gyimcsi '93 broke the game open in the fourth with a three-run homer to left field--his first round tripper of the year. In the fifth inning of the sec ond game, Susquehanna right fielder Chris Rcmbisz hit a grand slam off of Dave Koemer '92 to hand the i  i  i IWlllPIlSlwlIt#<< Ashley Chertkof/The Bucknellian Rightfielder Steve Gyimesi '93 blasts a three-run homer over the rightfield fence in the fourth inning of yesterday's home game against Susquehanna.

Tennis heads off to Patriot,
League Championships,"By Mike Markovich Staff Writer Due to more rainouts, the men's tennis team played another relatively light schedule this week. Saturday's match versus Patriot League adversary Fordham was scrapped, as was Wednesday's scheduled match at Franklin & -Marshall. The only match actually played last week was against another Patriot League opponent, Lafayette, on Tuesday, dominating them 8-1. This match provided Head Coach Craig Reynolds and the team with a much-needed opportunity to see what kind of competition they can expect from the teams around their conference as they prepare for the League Championships this week end at Colgate. A normal dual match against Colgate today should help provide another such view of what is to come on the following two days. But most of the league's talent has not been seen by Buckncll this year. They have only played two league matches to date, with a third today, but their chances for the weekend appear good if these can be used as indicators. The first was a close 5-4 victory over Lehigh, and the second was Tuesday's contest at Lafayette. The. fact that Buckncll lost only one match on the afternoon would seem to indicate that the team is peaking just in time for the season- ending tournament. Bucknell swept the singles matches, with only Jerome Charlier '92 needing a third set to down his opponent. Charlier played at his usual number one singles spot and was victorious 2-6, 6- 2,6-3. The rest of the singles matches were straight set affairs. At number two, Bruno Barbera '94 took the win 7- 6 (7-5), 6-0. The rest of the Buck nell singles sweep saw Andrew Cantor '92 win at number three 6-3, 7-5, Cris Stcnstrom victorious at number four, 6-2,6-4, captain Scott Bank on top 6-3,6-3 at number five, and Chris Rimpel '93 rounding out the field with a W at number six, 6- 1 , 6 - 2 . Buckncll's Achilles' heel came at number one doubles, where Charlier and Rimpel were defeated 5- 7, 6-2, 7-6 (7-2). The other doubles matches were captured by the Bison, with Barbera and Cantor taking the number two contest 6-4, 6- 4, and StcnstrOm and Bank avenging a first set loss to come back and win 2-6,6-2,6-0. The 2-1 doubles record brought the final match score to 8-1 in Buckncll's favor. This in turn brought their season mark to 6-5, 2- 0 in the conference. It is this type of play that Coach Reynolds hopes to bring to Colgate tomorrow for their dual match and the following League Championships. Despite having played only the two conference matches, the team's lineup for the weekend looks hard to beat on pa per. Acting on 20 years' coaching experience, Reynolds has formu lated this year's conference team after observing how certain players perform at different positions, and, for doubles, with different partners. Perhaps hoping to hold the level of play where it was for the Lafayette match, Reynolds entered a lineup for the Championship Weekend which See TENNIS, page 21"
mum,"ga it m mm- Colin Brldgewater/The Bucknellian Jerome Charlier '92 drives a backhand down the line during his num ber-one singles match against Lafayette last Tuesday. Charlier's 2,6, 6-2,6-3 victory kept his undefeated Patriot league record intact. Bison the 4-1 loss. Starter Tim Murray went all the way for the Crusaders, allowing only an RBI single to Mike Kearns '93. Ted Obligado '91 had a good game at the plate, going three for three. Rich Heller '94 started for Bucknell and pitched well, allowing no runs on three hits in four innings, despite walking four. Another fresh man, Scott Gerhardt (0-1) did not fare as well, giving up three runs on one hit and two walks in only one third of an inning. On Tuesday, homers by Kennedy and Koerner were not enough to overcome Lehigh's 11 -hit attack on Bison pitchers Dan Krewson '91 (2-2) and Jack Kazanjian '93. Koerner had two hits, and Obligado three, for Buckncll. Robert Funk pitched a complete game and Andy Carabillo collected three hits for Lehigh. In the first game of Saturday's double-header, Koerner doubled and tripled while driving in two in a 6-2 win for the good guys. Mike Rizzi '91 tossed his second complete game of the year to improve his record to 4-2. Kurt Waldner '93 won his third straight game in Patriot League action in the second game, a 9-5 win. He allowed just one earned run while striking out six. Kennedy and Gyimcsi had three hits each to pace the Bison attack. Waldner, the top returning pitcher from the 1990 team, contin ues to impress following early arm problems. The win over Lehigh im proved the righthander's record to 3- 1, and it was his third complete game--tops on the staff. Waldner has a 1.71 ERA in league games and is responsible for three of Bucknell's five conference wins. His 3.21 overall ERA is third on the team to Koerner (1.58) and Stevens (1.98). According to Kennedy, catcher and one of three captains, a positive attitude and resurgence of the pitching staff are the biggest Ashley Chertkof/The Bucknellian Shortstop Bill Rinker '92, pictured in a game earlier this year, blew out his knee against Patriot League rival Lehigh at home last Satur day afternoon. reasons for the Bison's positive turnaround from last year. ""The staff has been 100 percent better than last year. Coach [Bob] Mcllman and Coach [Gene] Depcw have done a great job with the pitchers, espe cially the freshmen,"" said Kennedy. Kennedy has also been one of the mainstays of the offense that sported a .297 team balling average entering the Susquehanna games. Ahrens, Patriot League Player of the Week, entered yesterday's games with a club-high .368 average. He also leads the team in homers (three), RBI (24), hits (35), stolen bases (11), and walks (17). Gyimesi (.347) and Koerner (.330) have also been red hot lately. Koerner is currently leading the na tion with .26 triples per game (seven in 27 games) and is only three shy of Ahrcn's school record of ten. Tomorrow the Bison will play a double dip at Colgate (0-6, 1-18), with a single game there on Sunday. Colgate is having a very disappoint ing season coming off of last year's performance when they won 15 games, the most for a Red Raider baseball team since 1966. Last yaer the team also set ten single-season hitting marks and was the first club to hit for a .300 average in school history. On Tuesday, April 30 Mt.

Drexel and Slippery Rock,"By Eliza Wampler Staff Writer This past week, the womens' lacrosse team faced the forces of Villanova and Colgate. The women suffered two losses with scores of 9- 7 and 11-7 respectively. At Villanova University April 19, Bucknell came out on fire scor ing first before concluding the first half outscoring Villanova 5-4 in an extremely fast-paced game. All units of the team came together to play very well for the Bison. The second half showed a continuation of this high caliber and aggressive play. The teams re mained about equal in their number of shots on goal during the second half, but Villanova scored two more times than Bucknell. Head Coach Jennifer Averill commented, ""The Villanova game was our strongest game of the season thus far. Even though it will not be a win for our record, it was a victory for the team. We accomplished ev erything that we needed to be suc cessful. I don't think that I could have asked more of my players."" The leading scorer for the Bi son was Jen Kehoe '94 with three goals. Trisha Way '94 had two, while Dori Lynn Ellwood '92 and Leslie Why '92 each contributed one. On Tuesday, at Colgate , the Lady Bison once again played a strong, competitive game. The big obstacle on the Colgate squad was a senior, Shari Krasnoo. Krasnoo is the Raiders' entire offensive threat and also the nation's leading scorer. To combat Krasnoo, Averill instructed Kristina Haas '91 and Way to double-team her all over the field. Haas and Way did a fantastic job denying her the ball, allowing her to only score twice, well below her six goal a game average. Averill remarked, ""Haas and Way really need to be commended on their defensive ag gression. They took Colgate's key player out of the game, causing an enormous amount of frustration for her and their team."" During the first half, the teams matched up fairly evenly. At half time, Bucknell was right in the game only one goal behind Colgate. The breakdown occurred in the beginning of the second half, when the Bison went through a lag of about twelve minutes in which they were entirely on the defensive end, showing no shots on goal. De spite this mental and physical lapse, the game on the whole was strong, as Assistant Coach Scott Prcstridgc commented, ""I don't think the score was reflective of how we played. Our game plan was to shut down Krasnoo, and we did that."" Why lead the scoring with three goals, as Kehoe had two, and Allison Arth '93 and Way each had one. With four games remaining in the season, Averill emphasized that the entire squad is extremely deter mined to finish up strong, ""I con tinue to have high expectations of improving our record, and I think that this weekend is our opportunity to do so."" The team's current record is 3-10 overall, and 1-3 in the Patriot League. This weekertd, they will be battling Drexel tomorrow away at 1 p.m., and Slippery Rock 1 p.m. Sunday at home."

Butler '91 signs with New York Giants,"B y Mitch Benton Staff Writer It's a phone call that all young football players dream of receiving. From Pop Warner to high school and through college, the player's ulti mate goal is to someday get a chance to play in the National Football League. For Bucknell's Jay Butler '91, that call finally came last Mon day, April 22. On the line was a representa tive from the New York Giants of fering Butler a free-agent contract and a chance to join the reigning Super Bowl Champions. Butler had received calls from the Giants, the New York Jets and the Seattle Seahawks during last week's N.F.L. draft and was expected to be taken in its late rounds. Instead, he was called immediately following its conclusion by the Seahawks and Giants. Seattle's squad did offer more of an opportunity for the 6' 7"", 292 pound tackle, but, ultimately, the better contract and location of fered by the Giants won his com mitment. Butler came to Bucknell from Hillsborough High School, in Somerville, New Jersey, where he earned six varsity letters, three each in football and baseball. He was equally proficient in both sports and earned a number of post-season honors, including being named to the All-Somerset County and All-Cen tral Jersey All-Star Squads. A mem ber of the National Honor Society, he was recognized during his senior year as Hillsborough High School's Outstanding Scholar-Athlete. Butler arrived in Lewisburg as a 6' 5"", 253 pound center and made an immediate impact on the football squad. He quickly earned a spot on the traveling team and received playing time at center, tackle, and tight end. Midway through his sophomore season, he earned a starting spot on the offensive line, a distinction he would not relinquish until finishing his career. During the 1989-90 football campaign, Butler started the entire season at right tackle. On the coaches' 100 point grading system for the effectiveness at his position, he earned an outstanding score of 80 or more four times. These included an 88 in a 27-12 victory over Co lumbia, a game in which he was named Bucknell's Outstanding Of fensive Player of the Week. He earned Division I-AA Honorable Mention All-American status ac cording to Don Henson's Football Gazette and finished the year earn ing the John Campana Award, given annually to Buckncll's outstanding offensive lineman. For his final collegiate season, Butler was asked to again change his position, a task which he meet with extreme success. From his new left tackle spot, he anchored the veteran Bison offensive line, collectively known as ""the Beast"". The line, and Butler in particular, led Bucknelj to a 7-4 record, its best mark in more than 25 years, and its second con secutive second place finish. For his efforts, Butler was named to the First team All-Patriot League Squad and again won the John Campana Award. While playing the season at tackle, Butler also served as the Bison's long snapper for punts and field goals. It is this versatility that makes him the most attractive to the N.F.L., and Giant scouts. He has played center, guard and tackle and, while he was the biggest player on Bucknell's gridiron team, some say that he still has room to grow. After his football career is concluded, Butler will have an out standing future awaiting him, as he will graduate in June with a bachelor of science degree in mechanical en gineering. But Butler will, at least for a time, put aside his engineering background. Today he will report to the defending champion's mini camp and in the fall, Butler will"
Ultimate reaches sectionals,"By Scott Brown Staff Writer When it begins to rain and the ground turns soft and all others head inside, venture out to the mods and you will undoubtedly see the Mudsharks, Buckncll's Ultimate Frisbee Team, throwing the disc and getting ho'(horizontal). Led by Todd Lieb '91, the team's captain, coach, treasurer and main motivator, the Mudsharks have increased in size and become a competitive force this season. Ultimate was created in 1968 at Columbia High School in New Jersey and has since blossomed into an international sport. The game did not reach Bucknell until the late 1970's but it has since prospered due in part to the laid-back atmosphere. ""There are no cuts: all that wc ask is that people show for up for practice and hustle when they're playing,"" commented Lieb on the reasons the sport has maintained its appeal. ""It just takes time to learn the game. There were guys who came out and were so bad I wanted to hit them and now they're really good."" The core of the team now con sists of about 20-25 guys although anyone is always welcome to play. This year has been one of the ""hot test times"" for the Mudsharks since 1981 when the team was ranked one of the top five in the country. Ulti mate has competed in four different tournaments this year at Allentown, Penn State, Haverford and Bloomsburg. At Bloomsburg the Mudsharks competed against other teams in their sectional. The Sharks won three of their first four games beating Drew, Lafayette and Swarthmore while falling to Rutgers. In the last, game, having already qualified for rcgionals, the Mudsharks were trailing Haverford 10-1 when a pouring rain added to already frigid temperatures. So the team, according to Lieb, ""went nuts and freaked out. We started to dive in the mud. It was really funny. We never take the game so seriously so that it's not fun."" Bucknell qualified for the rcgionals at Mt. St. Mary's in Mary land, the last stage before nationals. Unfortunately the team will be un able to attend according to Lieb ""partly due to money but most im portantly because of participation. The team, because of Parents' Weekend would only be able to carry seven or eight players instead of the full squad of 15 or 16, and we did not want to misrepresent the team."" The team names, which show the colorfulness of the sport, include the Lafayette Screaming Tomatoes and the Lehigh Spastic Plastic. The tournament's rituals are the most in triguing, but probably unknown, part of the sport. For instance, Dartmouth is called the Moo-disc so the team brings a cow to the tournaments it competes in and players ride him around. Drew has a cow skull and chants to it. The Mudsharks appropriately form a shark. Led by Lieb who forms a shark's jaw by clamping two discs together the rest follow behind him, a few forming fins and a tail, chasing a minnow, ""usually a freshman, un til they catch him,"" said Lieb. Also, the Sharks have a toy dinosaur known as the Squecb from which they claim they gain power. All the rituals have been part of Bucknell's team for years, al though there can always be additions made. This season, for example, Chris Williams '92 brings the two teams together before the game for a motivational poem about the plight of a disc. The future for ultimate at Bucknell is looking very strong be cause the current team has many freshmen and a strong core of lead ership in Williams and Jeff Warhover '93. The problem that does exist, according to Lieb, is the inability of the University to provide proper facilities for the club teams. The University's attempt to enlarge the fields behind the mods was un successful last year so men's and women's club lacrosse, rugby, and frisbee, all must try to share Swartz field. Even with these constraints, the Sharks always seem to be able to squeeze in somewhere to throw the disc around. So, come rain or sun shine, if you're in the mood for something a little different and not afraid to get a little dirty, head down to Swartz field or behind the mods and get ho'.

The recent standouts include Earl Beecham '86, who played with the Giants' ""Scab"" team during the 1986 player's strike, Ken Jenkins '81, who played with the Philadelphia Eagles, the Detroit Francisco Forty-Niners. Butler is following a path similar to that of last season's most valuable player, Scott Auchenbach '90, who also signed a free agent contract with the Giants and attended their camp. Bucknell's Head Football Coach, Lou Maranzana, likes very impressed with his determina tion and ability, but that level of competition is a tough challenge for anybody. I really hope that he can stay with the Giants. It's a very dif ficult challenge, but I think that it's exciting."""
Equestrian finishes second,
out of nine and gets ribbon,"By Cathy Retallak The Bucknell Equestrian Team's continuous training and de votion throughout the year has gained it regional recognition. When the points were tallied up from the fall and spring shows, the Bucknell team achieved second place out of the nine colleges and universities in the region. Other schools in the re gion include Penn State, Wilson College, Pitt, and Indiana University of Pennsylvania. An excited team brought home a large ribbon and the title of Reserve High Point Team of the Year 1990-91. This is quite an accomplishment from last year's first trek into intercollegiate compe tition. Since then the number of ac tive members has tripled. There have been six shows this year held at various hosting schools in the region. Each show consists of five different divisions of classes; beginner, advanced begin ner, novice, intermediate, and open, which accommodate skill levels from beginner to experienced riders. In the open, intermediate, and novice division, each rider competes in both a flat class and a jumping class. In the advanced beginner and beginner Courtesy of Bucknell Equestrian Team Cathy Retallack '93 and horse leap over an obstacle without picking up any faults during an early season show at Penn Sate. divisions, the riders compete in one fiat class. For each class, the com petitor rides an unfamiliar horse that has been randomly drawn. This en sures that the riders are judged solely on their riding skills and not on the horse, which is provided by the hosting school. Courtesy of Ultimate Frisbee Team Steve Guenther '92 freestyles the disc in one of the Mudsharks' prac tices at the mod fields. If riders attend most of the shows and do well, they may accu mulate enough individual points to qualify for the Regional competi tion, the equivalent to Conference championships in other sports. Once a rider has qualified for Regionals he or she will then be moved up to the next division. The last regular show of the season was held at Penn State on Saturday, April 13th. This was the last chance for riders to gain quali fying points for Regionals. Some of the Bucknell riders had qualified earlier in the season, but for others their performance on Saturday re mained the deciding factor. The Bucknell Equestrian Team ended its regular show season with a strong performance at Penn State. Despite the cold rainy weather, the riders showed lots of enthusiasm. Captain Kelly Kordish '92 started off the day on a good note by winning the open flat class and qualifying herself for Regionals. President Cathy Retallack '93 placed fifth in open jumping. Retallack had qualified for Rcgionals earlier in the season. In the intermediate division Jocelyn Perot '94 placed third in jumping. Bucknell has three strong novice riders.

A view of the NBA's second season,"By Mike Sw anson There arc three certain things in life: death, taxes and the fact that the Los Angeles Clippers will be playing golf and not basketball come playoff time. Despite the absence of the Clips, the NBA playoffs should be as intense and exciting as ever, with 15 teams attempting to de throne the two-time defending champion Detroit Pistons. Here is one expert's view of the NBA post season (in case you arc scoring at home, the championship should be concluded by the beginning of the Fall Semester)."
EAST FIRST ROUND,"Chicago Bulls vs. New York Ewings: The only reason I'm not predicting Michael and his mates will order brooms to sweep the floor of Madison Square Garden is that I have friends who arc Knicks' fans. Michael Jordan is simply the best basketball player on the planet and not even the defensive prowess of Kiki Vandeweghe, whom Jordan calls ""the best defensive player in the league"", can stop him. Patrick Ewing may break the record for shots taken in a playoff scries, but there is no other Knick who can score. The real question in this series is which Knick Medical Bill Cartwright will put in the hos pital with his lethal elbows. The Bulls will win in four games. Boston Celtics vs. Indiana Pacers: Larry Bird has more fans in the state of Indiana than the Pacers do. That alone should give some in dication as to how this series will progress. The Celtics improved greatly this year with the acquisition of young and fast players like Brian Shaw .Pee ""pump it up"" Brown to complement their fantastic vet eran trio of Bird, Parish and Me Hale. The Pacers are youthful and on the rise, but are about two years away from contending. Reggie ""I'm in the gym, so I must be open"" Miller and sixth-man extraordinaire Detlcf Schrempf should keep the Pacers close, but Boston's experience will lead them to a three game sweep. Detroit Pistons vs. Atlanta Hawks: The old sports cliche says that defense wins championships. No team plays better defense in the playoffs than do the Pistons. Atlanta is a perfect match-up for the Pistons because at times it looks as if the Hawks would rather pass a kidney stone than the basketball. Dennis ""The Worm"" Rodman will stifle Dominique Wilkins in his attempt to create more highlight film. The Hawks have no other players that could threaten Detroit. Those factors along with the return of Isiah Thomas and the clutch play of Mr. Underrated, Joe Dumars.will lead the Pistons to win in four games. By the way, has Ted Turner been released from the mental hos pital he checked into after signing Jon Koncak to a 6-year, $13.2 mil lion contract? Milwaukee Bucks vs. Phila delphia 76ers: Pop Quiz - Name at least one starter for the Bucks. Nei ther can I. Milwaukee amazed the entire league this year by winning forty-eight games with such as tounding talent as Fred ""Psycho"" Roberts, Danny Schayes and Jack Skima. That sounds more like an accounting firm than an NBA front line. The 76ers are led by Charles Barkley, unofficial league leader in tax-deductible fines, and the dead- eye three-point shooting of Manute Bol. Since it seems like half the Bucknell campus admits to being fans of Philadelphia, for my health and well-being, I pick Sir Charles and his Bump and Thump mates to spit Team Vertical Leap into the off season in six games."
SECOND ROUND,"Chicago vs. Philadelphia: A rematch of last year. The Sixers held leads in the fourth quarter in all six playoff games but only managed to win two of them. This time around, they will only win one. The Bulls in five. Boston vs. Detroit: The mys tique of the famed parquet floor at Boston Garden will lift the Celtics to victory in the seventh game. This scries should be hard-fought and extremely physical. The over/under on calls Bill Laimbcer whines about is 25."
EAST FINALS,"Chicago vs. Boston: The rau cous Chicago Stadium crowd will lift the well-rested Bulls to a game seven victory. Michael Jordan will get his first chance at an NBA cham pionship ring after two consecutive losses in the Eastern Conference Fi nals to Detroit. After the series, Larry Bird will again describe Jor dan as God disguised as a basketball player."
WEST FIRST ROUND,"Portland Trail Blazers vs. Seattle SuperSonics: The only per tinent question in Oregon and Washington is whether the weekly rainfall in the Pacific Northwest will be as large as Portland's margin of victory. The Trail Blazers proved to the basketball world that last year's trip to the finals was no fluke, and finished the season strongly by win ning 16 of their final 17 games. Their starting five, led by All-Stars Terry Porter and Clyde ""The Glide"" Drexler, is among the best in the league and their bench depth is sec ond to none. They are clearly the class of the West. Seattle does boast standouts like the manchild Shawn Kemp and Benoit Benjamin. However, they are no match for deeper and more expe rienced Trail Blazers. The Sonics have about as much chance of win ning a game in this scries as the Mariners do of finishing over .500."
Men's Lax,"From page 22 difficulty with Penn St. mainly be cause of their ""inability to get going in the first quarter."" He said, ""Like I told the team, it looked as if we were still in the bus. After the first quar ter, when they jumped to a 6-2 lead, we were in the game."" Commenting on whether the rigorous schedule may have been a factor in their lackluster first quarter play, Jamieson replied, ""We work our kids hard and it's a long season. We simply don't have the depth of a larger team like Penn State. They pressured very well and made our defense play hard."" Jamieson stressed that he was pleased with how the team came back, even in the closing minutes of the game. ""They made some good plays, some high-energy plays, even with four minutes left. Slreelman played very well and Davis and Schwartz put in some good play, as well."" Jamieson assessed the team's play thus far as being well above par. He said, ""We are playing better than we have all season. They know what they are supposed to do, and now it's just a question of getting it all done. They are beginning to play more consistently. We have a great team"

Portland in three easy games. San Antonio Spurs vs. Golden State W arriors: The matchup at center pits David Robinson and Alton Lister. Does anymore need to be written about his series? No, but I'll continue anyhow. The Midwest Division Champ Spurs are a better team than last year's version that lost to Portland in seven tough games Point Guard Rod Strickland has improved greatly and Coach Larry Brown will keep him out of all nightclubs during the playoffs. The Admiral had another fantastic season in winning the re bounding title and Willie Anderson is underrated as a swingman. Golden State's incomparable scoring trio Run-T.M.C.- Tim Hardaway, Mitch Richmond and Chris Mullin will raise some hell against the Spurs, but they won't be enough to win more than one game. Mr. Robinson's Neighborhood will remain safe from these Warriors and the Spurs advance to the second round in four games. Los Angeles L akers vs. Houston Rockets: The Lakers showed their age last year in their lethargic second round loss to Phoenix. The off-season acquisi tions of Sam Perkins and Terry Teagle turned Showtime into Slowtime, with the Lakers turning into a half-court team. Despite early season struggles learning new coach Mike Dunleavy's new system, the Lakers still finished with the third best record in the league. The surge is due to the Lakers Big Two, Magic and Worthy (who else?). The Rockets have been the hottest team in basketball since the return of the Nigerian Nightmare, center Hakeem Olajuwon. Hkenny Smith is easily this year's most im proved player and guard Hvcnon Maxwell made the most three-point shots in the regular season. Houston coach Hdon Chancy is a candidate for the Coach of the Year after it was rumored he would be axed at the conclusion of the year. That was before his team accumulated the second-best record in the second half of the season (behind Chicago). The Lakers arc primed for an early round exit and the Rockets could be the team to do it. But not this year. Magic won't let his team lose and Worthy will be double- teamed by Houston players and not the Houston police on this trip to Texas. Los Angeles will win the best first-round series in five tough games. Phoenix Suns vs. Utah Jazz: Question: Will the Jazz and its All- ''tar duo of Karl Malone and John Stockton ever win a first-round se ries in the playoffs? Answer: No, well, at least not this year as Utah's only professional team will choke again. The Jazz simply don't have a good enough supporting cast around Malone and Stockton to be a threat in the playoffs. Mark Eaton is a li ability at center and the bench is mediocre at best. Well, at least Utah has great skiing. The Suns have some of the best talent in the entire league with All-Stars Kevin Johnson, Tom Chambers, Xavier McDaniel and super-sub Thunder Dan Majerle. The problem for Phoenix has been meshing these individual talents into a team concept. This could be the year their potential gels. Coach Cot ton Fitzsimmons will give a calen dar to Chambers that says it is still the regular season and that Tom is allowed to play well. Phoenix' over all talent will defeat the Jazz's dy namic duo in four games."
SECOND ROUND,"Portland vs. Phoenix: A rematch of last year's Western Con ference Finals. Portland won that se ries in six games after Sun's point guard Kevin Johnson went down with an injury. The Trail Blazers are still a superior team, but the acquisi tion of Xavier McDaniel will help the Suns negate Portland's superior size. Despite the Blazers deeper bench, a healthy KJ will lead Phoe nix back to the conference finals. Expect the best dunk of the scries to be by Phoenix's mascot, the Gorillia. That ape can throw it down. Los Angeles vs. San Antonio: Another case where the Lakers could easily go down to defeat, but won't. Magic realizes that his days are numbered and he won't accept los ing to a team led by young Rod Strickland. David Robinson will eat up the Yugo import Vladc Diva (even Robinson's commercials are better) and single-handedly keep the Spurs afloat in the series. The Admiral won't be enough however, and Los Angeles will advance to the confer ence finals in seven competitive games."
WEST FINALS,"Los Angeles vs. Phoenix: The ' Suns humiliated the Lakers in five- games in last year's second round. * Magic and Co. will obviously be- looking for revenge this year. They > will look, but they won't like whatt they see. The key to Phoenix' stunning', defeat of the Lakers last year was> their superior quickness. The same: holds true this year, except that Los > Angeles is slower with Perkins and I Teagle now in the lineup. The Suns i will exploit that advantage again and win the scries in six relatively easy games. Magic will be his usual phe nomenal self, but will fall short of another championship ring."
NBA FINALS,"Chicago vs. Phoenix: Michael will win an NBA champi onship to go along with his 1982 National Championship as a baby Tar Heel. Although Jordan will be- the star of the finals, his teammates, . especially Pippen and the much- maligned bench, will contribute im1- mensely and the Bulls will beat Phoenix in six games. with a unique group of guys."" The Bison will face Colgate away this week. Colgate returns their entire attack squad from last season including Gregg Perry, who was the leading goal-scorer in the nation last year based on goals per game. Jamieson describes this game as a ""must win"" game simply to avenge their embarrassing loss to Colgate last season. The Bison also look to finish strong so that they will have a win ning record on the season. With the puzzle seeming to fit together for the first lime all season, this goal ap pears to be more realistic than ever."

Track battles at Shippensbura Athlete of the week,_ _ _ m H I _ _____________ _
I,"%, ^AEsMmEEEki. MMAEtEEEEIEEElEtPEEEEIEEEEEElEEtEEEEKM By Chris Drowne Staff Writer The Bucknell and Shippcns- burg track teams rekindled a rivalry second only to that of the historical Union and Confederate armies. To say that these two teams detest one another would be euphemistic. Shippcnsburg's Seth Grove Stadium replaced the Gettysburg as the site of this year's historic battle. Gencral/Hcad Coach Art Gouldcn led his men's and women's troops onto the cold and rainy track. Meanwhile, Shippcnsburg's Gcn- cral/Coach Bob Walker mounted a solid defense of their home territory. Last season, both the men's and women's garrisons posted vic tories, 85-73 and 93-52 respectively. This year, however, casualties would increase as point totals decreased for the Bison men. The women, on the other hand, managed to fulfill their objective. Gen. Gouldcn initiated a suc cessful first strike on the Red Raid ers' front line. Private First Class Jim Bock '92 received the Congressional Medal of Honor for his first-place finishes in the 100 and 200-mctcr dashes. Pvt. Bock's 10.7 second time in the 100-mctcr dash qualified him for IC4A championships. Infantry-"
Tennis,"man Derek Hamilton '94 followed Pvt. Bock with second-place finishes in those two events. Private Mark Lore '93 raced to third place in the 400-metcr dash while Private First Class Jeff Loomis '92 and Lieutenant Norbcrt Berenyi '91 placed second and third in the 800-mctcr dash, respectively. One of the first casualties of the afternoon occurred when Infantryman Jean Simon '94 re-pulled a strained ham string muscle and fell to the battle field separating his left shoulder. Before receiving his Purple Heart, Inf. Simon popped his own shoulder back into place. Lt. Berenyi was victorious in the 1500-meter as Private Tom Eagleson '93 captured third. In the 3000-meter steeplechase, Private First Class Tom Wuchenich '92 and Private John Lewis '93 mounted suc cessful assaults finishing first and second, respectively. The Red Raiders' defensive strategy began to take effect as they swept six events gaining 55 points. Private Blaine Fawcett's '93 second- place high-jump effort and Private First Class Doug Morgan's '92 sec ond-place long-jump interrupted a number of successful Red Raider offensives. In the shot-put and discus Lieutenant Paul Austin '91 captured second and Private Pete Gregory '93 received third in the latter event In the climactic confrontation, Shippcnsburg's Lieutenant Chris Monheim '91 used cruel and de ceitful methods violating the basic agreement of the Geneva Conven tion when he attacked Bison Pri vates First Class Jason Cahilly '92 and Matt Dcardorff'92 from behind as Lt. Monheim moved into first place in the 5000-meter race. For the victorious Lady Bi son, Lieutenant Lynnettc McBride '91, Private First Class Tricia Plasko '92 and Private Julie Dicrcks '93 swept the 100-metcr dash. Pvt. F-C Plasko and Lieutenant Alison Sacgcr '91 captured first and third respectively in the 200-mcter. Other successful sweeps of enemy Red Raiders occurred in the 800 and 1500-meter dashes. Private Gina Abraham '93 received Bucknell's second Congressional Medal of Honor for her first-place finishes in the aforementioned events. Infantrywoman Cathy Wurster '94 captured thrid-placc finishes in the same two events. Fellow Infantrywoman Beth Muchl '94 fin ished second in the 800. Lieutenant Kelly Marsh '91 raced to victory in the 3000-meter as Private Kristin Opdyke '93 grabbed second in this event as well as the 1500. L l Marsh earned her Congressional Medal of Honor by winning her second event, the 5000- meter. Lieutenant Colleen O'Mahan '91 ran to third. In the 100-mctcr hurdles, Lieutenant Karen Shimomura '91 exceeded her commanding officer's expectations in winning and quali fying for ECAC's with the second- best Bucknell performance of all time. Infantrywoman Carla DcBiasi '94 seized victory in the 400-mctcr hurdles and second in the 100-mctcr hurdles. Private First Class Gcri Kcmisan '92 finished second in the 400-metcr hurdles. Lt. McBride achieved the Congressional Medal of Honor for her another first-place finish, this time in the long jump. Private First Class Lynda Rose '92 captured sec ond in the long jump and first in the triple jump. Infantrywoman Dawn Ellery '94 rounded out the Lady Bison's scoring with a third-place finish in the high jump. Next on Gen. Gouldcn's agenda is this weekend's Millersville Metric Invitational. The Bison troops will then return home the following weekend for the inau gural Patriot League Championships to be held in Christy Mathcwson Memorial Stadium. The event will be aired live on WVBU 90.5."
Sharon Nichols '91,"Softball pitcher Sharon Nichols '91 is selected Athlete of the Week for going three and one on the week, including a no-hiucr aginst Lehigh this past Tuesday. The Williamsport native has pitched 59 1/3 consecutive innings without allowing an earned run. She's lowered her ERA to a nationally ranked 0.27. Nichols also received Patriot League Pitcher of the Week honors last week. The softball team carries a 22-9-1 in its Patriot League double- header at Colgate this weekend."
Horses,"From page 19 From page 17 reads exactly the same as that used to down Lafayette last week. The singles positions, one through six, reads: Charlicr, Barbcra, Cantor, Stcnstrdm, Bank, and Rimpcl. As for doubles, Charlicr and Rimpcl will lead the charge at num ber one, and will be backed by Barbcra and Cantor at number two and Stcnstrdm and Bank at three. None of these doubles combinations has yet lost a match in league play, and overall, Barbcra and Cantor is the only duo to have lost at all. The only individual singles records showing league defeats are those of Sicnslrom and Rimpel, who arc both 1-1. Looking at the team Bucknell has to offer, it would seem that they should finish near the top of the League. Charlier believes, 'The team to beat this year is definitely Army, but I don't foresee them dominating the tournament.

Kordish and Schulte both won their flat classes in the open and intermediate divisions. Grammont captured 3rd place in novice flat. Rctallack and Christie both rode well, but missed qualifying by a few places. Kordish, Schulte, and Grammont travelled to Stoncy Brook, Long Island, NY this past Sunday for the Zone competition. This show was more competitive, as the top three riders in each division from three surrounding regions competed against each other. The rider who place first and second in each class then move on to the Na tional competition.

Pitcher of the Week and Player of the Week spark sweeps of both Lafayette and Lehigh,"By Todd Bianchine Staff Writer The women's softball team had its six-game winning streak snapped yesterday by a powerful Bloomsburg squad, currently ranked fourth among Division II teams. Bloomsburg was able to come back in the first game to win 3-1, and went on to rout the Lady Bison in the second game 15-1. The losses dropped Buckncll to a 22-9-1 record overall with an 8-2 record in league play, and the Huskies raised their mark to 31 -3. Colin Bridgewater/ The Bucknellian Wendy Fitz '94, here seen in a loss earlier against Hofstra, is Buckneli's starting shortstop and has played in every game for the Bison this season. In the first game Bucknell spotted senior pitcher Sharon Nichols '91 a 1-0 lead in the first inning when Lisa Fink '93 doubled, stole third and came home when the throw went into lcflficld. One run looked like all that Nichols would need after coming off a no-hit effort against Lehigh on Tuesday. How ever, the Huskies struck in the top of the sixth when a line drive off Janet Buckhcit's bat was dropped by Karen Smolskis '91 in deep center field, which brought in the tying run. Bloomsburg's leading hitter, Marty Laudato .514, then hit a deep sacri fice fly to left, scoring Buckheit from third. Bloomsburg went on to score one more run on a sacrifice fly in the inning to wrap up a 3-1 victory. All three runs scored on Nichols were unearned and the loss dropped her to 12-4. The second game was all Bloomsburg right from the begin ning. The Huskie batters jumped all over the Buckncll pitchers tagging them for 16 runs in five innings. Buckncll was able to avoid the shutout when Devaney Kerr '94 crossed the plate in the bottom of the fifth, but the ten run ""mercy rule"" took effect giving Bloomsburg the 16-1 win. Fink took the loss moving her to 7-5. ""We just have to forget these games,"" said Coach Dale Franquct to his squad after the second game. ""We have to start thinking about [Colgate] this weekend."""
M en's Lax splits pair with,
Pennsylvania opponents,"By Jamie Diaferia Staff Writer The Bison men's lacrosse team split a pair of games this week, defeating Lehigh 10-5 Saturday and losing to Penn Slate on Wednesday, 17-11. The team performed well in both contests and the win against Lehigh should give Buckncll the confidence they need to finish the season strong with only four games remaining. Last week the Bison competed against Ohio State and Air Force, winning both games decisively. Af ter those games, Head Coach Sid Jamieson expressed his belief that the team was undergoing a rapid and necessary set of changes. He stated that the team was ahead of schedule in this regard, but that it still had to gain both experience and confi dence. The Bison may have done just that against Lehigh (4-4) on Saturday when they beat a tough team at an away game in front of a tough crowd. Colin Bridgewater/The Bucknellian Attackman Doug DePietro '92 scored two goals against Lehigh at home last Saturday. DePietro, seen here in action against Holy Cross, leads the team in points. The Bison won the game 10-5 behind stunning defense and the unstoppable offensive attack of Kevin Roth '92 and Mike Conway '92. Roth led all scorers with six goals, while Conway provided the team with the opportunities to score as he led the team with three assists. Conway's play was described by Jamieson as ""unbelievable."" Other scorers for the Bison included Doug DePietro '92 with two, co-captain Tom Davis '91 and Todd Streelman '93. Garret Schwartz '91 added two assists in the effort. Colin Barker '94, slowly tak ing over the starting job in goal, provided all the defense Bucknell needed for the upset, as he stopped 15 of 20 shots. His play thus far this season has been a pleasant surprise for the young Bison squad. Jamieson was thrilled with the victory on Saturday, stating that it was a ""blue-collar victory."" He added, ""The game was a physical, tough, hard-nosed type of game where we executed things better than they did. We did the things that had to be done. We cleared the ball ef fectively and the defense played well."" He noted, however, that much of the credit for the victory must go to Conway. He said, ""For Conway to get three assists as a long stick defenseman is unheard of at this level of play. He enabled us to con sistently pull away in the game. Even when Lehigh got the ball he would come up with another gem and break their momentum. He's exceedingly fun to watch play."" The Bison headed to Penn Slate (7-4) on Wednesday where they were defeated 17-11 after put ting in a strong offensive effort. Roth provided four of the goals for the Bison, while Streelman and Schwartz added two apiece. Greg Brown '92, Justin Zackey '94 and Davis each scored a goal as well. Streelman had four assists to lead the Bison, while Dc Pietro added two more. Barker had a few difficulties in goal as he was hit with a barrage of shots. He stopped 13 shots, but al lowed the remaining 17 to slip through. Jamieson felt the Bison had See MEN'S LAX, page 20 Patriot League play has been much more enjoyable for the Lady Bison, with the exception perhaps of their South Carolina trip over spring break. Bucknell dominated Lehigh on Tuesday sweeping the Engineers 8-1 and 5-0. The series was high lighted by superior pitching by Nichols and Fink. Fink pitched a two-hitter in the first game, striking out the Lehigh batters nine times. The offense was led by three-hit per formances by both Heather Hochn '94 and Jennifer Kalochic '91. In the second game Nichols did two better as she tossed her fourth career no-hitter, striking out five batters in the process. It looked like Nichols might have lost her no hit bid in the seventh when a ball dropped into right field, but Jill Szafranski '93 was there to gun the runner out at first for the final out of the game. Jennifer Yuengling '93 provided the big bat tripling and driving in two runs. On Saturday Buckncll re ceived some late inning heroics from Yuengling to defeat Patriot League foe Lafayette. Yuengling drove Hoehn in from third with a sacrifice fly in the bottom of the eighth in ning. This gave Nichols, who came in to relieve Fink in the eighth in ning, her second win of the day and the Lady Bison a 6-5 victory. Buckncll sailed through through the first game guided by a four-hit pitching performance by Nichols. Fink tore up the Lady Leopards' pitching with a three-for- thrcc performance, including a home run and two ground-rule doubles. Fink also scored three runs and drove in four more. Buckncll will travel to Colgate tomorrow to battle the Red Raiders for second place in the con ference as both teams go in at 8-2. The women must be wary of Colgate's deep pitching staff. On offense the Red Raiders arc led by sophomore Amanda Travis, who finished sixth nationally in hitting last year with a .427 average. The Bison will host Towson State on Tuesday for a double- header out on the mod fields at 3:30 p.m.. Buckncll will then travel to Allentown for the Patriot League tournament cither as the second or third seed, based on the outcome of the Colgate games played tomorrow."

Golf finishes season fourth,
at Patriot Leagues tourney,"By Chris Drowne Staff Writer Upstate New York did its best Central Pennsylvania impersonation of constant rain and cold wind last weekend. As a result, the Patriot League golf championships at Colgate were shortened from 54 holes to just 36. Army and Colgate finished first and second respectively. 'Buckncll and Lehigh fought down to the wire for third, but the Bison came up two strokes short of the Engineers in the end. When asked to comment on the playing conditions, Bison Head Coach Tommy Thompson said, ""They were the worst I've seen in my ten years associated with the golf team. The tournament shouldn't have been played."" Players from every school were victimized by the additional lakes on the course turning in results that looked more like B+/A- test scores than golf scores. Only four out of 42 golfers managed to shoot under 80 on the first day and just two the following day. Buckneil's draw made matters even worse. The Bison were the last ones to tee-off after waiting! five to six hours for their opponents to complete their rounds. By that time the course had become even worse. The greens turned to duck ponds with lies having to be moved within two yards of the cup. Individually for the Bison, Don Hansen '94 and Glenn Hertzbcrg '94 led the way with two round totals of 165 and 166 respec tively. Dave Fries '93, Doug Dollcnberg '94 and Captain Michael Smigie '92 all broke 180 to keep Bucknell 12 strokes ahead of fifth- place Lafayette. Fordham and Holy Cross should have saved hotel costs and stayed home. They both finished over 50 strokes off the pace. In an anti-climactic season fi nale, the Bison traveled to the Susquehanna Valley Country Club for the Susquehanna Tournament. Without Smigie, Buckncll managed to finish second, five strokes behind the host Crusaders. Hertzbcrg shot a 74 to tic for medalist honors with Wilkes' number one golfer; but he won the playoff on the third extra hole. Hansen had a 78, Fries an 82, and Chris Curti '94 an 81.

Both runs scored in the game were un earned, dropping Stevens' ERA to 1.19. ing force behind this stretch in which Bucknell has won nine straight games, including 13 of its last IS. In the past week the stickmen have scored 63 runs in six games. Roger Ahrens '91 hit .560 (14-25) this week with four home runs, 14 RBS, and 12 runs scored--not a bad year for some guys.

The plan con cretely defines sexual assault, calls for the creation of a specially trained sexual assault hearing board to adju dicate such cases, and clearly speci fies the rights of both the victim and the accused. The policy is a revised version of a draft originally written by Janice Butler, director of the women's re source center, and Arlyne Hoyt, di rector of psychological services, who co-chair the committee on re spect and equality (CRE).

""We're hope fully going to act on it by the end of the semester."" Once completed, that draft will be presented to Sojka for ap proval. ""Since it's only an interim policy, he will probably just imple ment it, in consultation with others,"" predicted Charlotte Weddle, associ ate vice president for student life.

Four-year residency,
plan slated for 1992-93,"By Tara Gilligan Staff Writer Pending approval by President Sojka, the University will be adopt ing a four-year residency require ment which will go into effect for the 1992-93 school year. According to John Dunlop, dean of students, the new policy is both a ""fiscal and po litical"" attempt by the University to keep all of its current housing filled to capacity and to prevent students who have been disciplinary prob lems from living in town. The policy, written by mem bers of Trustee Implementation Planning (TIP), was part of a seven teen-point recommendation for so cial changes which Sojka delivered to the Trustees last year. A commit tee of students, administrators, and townspeople drafted the final pro posal. ""There was a lot of pressure and a lot of concern from people who live in student areas,"" said Steve Hoerter, co-chair of the TIP four- year residency requirement commit tee. For fiscal reasons, the Univer sity needs to maintain full-capacity housing in its residence halls. In a time of changing student demo graphics across the nation, the Uni versity is taking precautionary mea sures to ensure that even if enroll ment drops in coming years, it will be able to fill all of its present resi dence halls. Gerry Commerford, as sistant dean for housing, said that the University wishes to maintain ""maximum income for the benefit of all students."" The University de pends on revenue raised by student room rentals. Empty rooms could be financially burdensome. The University once required students to live on campus for all four years, but removed the require ment more than two decades ago as the number of students began to ex ceed the number of rooms available on campus. As student enrollment continued to rise, the University built additional housing. Presently, two residence areas, the Gateways and Smith Hall, are still being paid for out of room rentals, increasing the need to continually fill all rooms. ""It could well be that our enrollment will decline gradually or sharply within the next few years... To pro tect ourselves from financial diffi culty we want to put in the require ment again,"" said Dunlop. Under the policy, a special ad ministrative committee will review the disciplinary records of all stu dents who apply to live off campus. After the review, students will be subjected to a lottery system, similar to the lottery system used for on- campus housing, to determine who will be eligible to live off campus. The committee will review students' discipline records and ""serve as a petitioning body"" to hear appeals, said Commerford. The discipline review commit tee will decide at a later point exactly what types of disciplinary offenses will be severe enough to make an in dividual ineligible to live off cam pus. But for the first year at least, the committee will look at each appli cant on a case by case basis. ""We See RESIDENCY, page 2 W m m m jfijgigjlip3"

P H,"Ashley Chertkof / The Bucknellian Gerry Commerford, associate dean for housing, believes the new four-year residency policy to be instituted in 1992-93 will have little effect on the current student body. chaired. CRCR's report, submitted in August 1990, suggested major modifications to the University's present discipline system, including sexual assault cases. Because of the magnitude of CRCR's suggestions, however, its implementation may take a year or more. Butler approached Weddle in December 1990 with, as Weddle re members, the concern that ""victims of sexual assault shouldn't have to wait a year"" for the protection a tan gible sexual assault policy would provide. After reviewing both CRCR's report and Butler and Hoyt's draft policy, Sojka asked CCA to determine whether an in terim policy should be adopted. CCA agreed that a sexual as sault policy should be put in place before the larger CRCR proposal goes into effect. CCA began work ing with Butler and Hoyt's draft in an attempt to finalize it as soon as possible. The penultimate draft defines sexual assault as ""deliberate physi cal contact of a sexual nature which is against one's will or without con sent"" It also advocates several ma jor changes to University policy. First, a sexual assault hearing board, separate from the current 12 mem ber committee on student conduct, is to be created to adjudicate cases of alleged sexual assault. The new board will consist of a male and female student, a male and female faculty member, and one administrator. According to the draft, all five members will receive special training in ""characteristics of rape trauma syndrome, myths and facts about sexual assault..., and ap propriate rules of evidence."" Hoyt agreed that board members should have a ""heightened sensitivity to vic tims' reactions."" The small size of the board is also designed ""to reduce concerns over confidentiality and the intimi dating nature of a larger group,"" ac cording to a memorandum written by Butler.

STEP helps diversify Bucknell,"By Elizabeth Danneberg Staff Writer Bucknell is one of five univer sities nationwide to host a Summer Transfer Enrichment Program (STEP). The STEP program gives inner-city community college stu dents a chance to attend a four-year college when they ordinarily would not be able to do so, due to their fi nancial situation. ""We can experi ence something which would ordi narily be out of reach... It gives us confidence in our abilities,"" says Saabirah Warthen '94, one of the ten students who have been given this opportunity in the STEP program. The program, which began at the end of June 1990, extracted 25 students from the Community Col lege of Philadelphia (CCP) to attend a six-week term of classes. The stu dents could choose two out of three combination classes: math and en gineering, computers and environ mental science, and English and psy chology. These courses were taught by a Bucknell professor and a CCP professor. Housing in Swartz hall was provided for the STEP students, which, adds Warthen, ""was a nice change from commuting in Philadel phia."" The summer term was so en couraging for these students that ten of them have decided to continue pursuing Bachelor degrees at Buck nell. Susan Zingale, who served as STEP program coordinator, com ments that this was ""shocking and thrilling at the same time."" Zingale and Associate Professor Richard Smith of the English department, the latter who served as faculty coordi nator, helped put the program to gether under the direction of Tom Greaves vice president of academic affairs. The program will be offered this summer as well, with Judith Becker serving as chief administra tor in place of Greaves. See STEP, page 2 m m *"

Residency,"From page 1 don't want to come out with a list just arbitrarily because not all mis behavior is equal,"" Dunlop said. The committee, he suggested, might look at patterns of misconduct ""This is a case where subjec tivity is better than cut and dried,"" he said. Bucknell's decision to review students' conduct is virtually un precedented; only Brown University has a similar policy. ""It is an attempt to affect behavior positively in the community. People who we think are too risky to live down there har moniously, responsibly, success fully, we'll keep them on the here on the campus,"" said Dunlop."

Policy--,"From page 1 Second, the CCA draft sets forth a condensed time table for the adjudication of sexual assault cases. Accountability in each case must be determined within 10 days of the original complaint. The swiftness of the system is designed both to better serve the alleged victim and to insure the safety of the campus community. Alacrity also dictates that the new policy eliminate the preliminary in vestigating committee and its report, both of which are usually required in University disciplinary cases. Finally; the policy spells out -  specific rights granted to both vic tims and alleged sexual assailants. Both parties are assured of the assis tance of an adviser, the right to de cline to answer self-incriminating questions, the availability of an ap- Dunlop did say, however, that few students will be affected. ""Not enough students are that bad,"" he said. Of the nearly 400 students who will live off-campus not more than about a half dozen have had serious conduct problems, he said. In general, the policy will have little effect on current students, Commerford predicts. Because stu dent demographics have not pro duced the decreasing enrollment other schools have faced, most stu dents wishing to live off campus will be able to. ""For the next few years I think the outcome will be that almost everyone who wants to live off cam pus will be able to,"" said Hoerter. The TIP proposal has, for the most part, received commendation are given the right situation, they may flourish."" STEP not only in stills optimism in these disadvan taged inner-city students, many of whom are single parents as well, but it also helps to diversify Bucknell's campus. The STEP program students from CCP were selected on the basis of several criteria. The students must have com- peal, and complete confidentiality, among other things. Indeed, Weddle believes that the policy's ""great strength is its bal anced approach. It lets students come forward knowing that they will be treated in a prompt, fair, and sen sitive manner."" Butler agrees that the policy is useless if victims don't step forward. ""I welcome any change that makes the system more accessible to sexual assault victims,"" she said. Weddle concluded ""[we must] provide a responsive system that's balanced with one that's fair."" After CCA issued its penul timate draft, both Butler and Weddle send memoranda highlighting some questions they had with the policy. ""Mostly they're clarifying main points,"" said Gatteau, ""but there are other points we're still discussing."" Once CCA issues its final draft to from Lewisburg residents. Jacquie Stiefel, a resident who served on the TIP committee, feels the require ment will help students and towns people ""to live with one another."" She spoke of residents' complaints that college students do not ad equately care for property. ""It's not fair of the students not to take care of the property where they live,"" she said, hoping that the new policy will alleviate some of the property de struction. According to Dunlop, though no new reduction in the number of students living off campus is likely to take place for some years, ""Stu dents will know that behavior is now a factor in being able to live off cam pus."" pleted two years of community col lege, and compete well academi cally, yet the program primarily wanted those for whom a four-year college would be an impossibility due to a lack of financial resources. Students were required to interview, write papers about themselves and provide two professor recommenda tions in order to apply for the STEP program. Sojka, however, parties unhappy with the policy must address their concerns directly to him. ""Gary's going to have to make the deci sions,"" said Butler. She continued, ""There are some things that I would like to see in the CCA draft, but I believe CCA's version is better than what we have now."" Weddle agreed, say ing ""I think we're all moving in the same direction. I think those details don't warrant a long-term delay."" Once CCA is finished with the interim sexual assault policy, it will turn its attention back to the CRCR report in hopes of revamping the en tire University conduct and disci pline code by 1992."

Office of Communications (717) 787-1783.,"Other community members, though agreeing with the policy, raised certain concerns. ""We do question a section [of the TIP pro posal] concerning students who own or whose parents own property as being exempt from the lottery,"" David Broadt, president of the Bor ough of Lewisburg, wrote in a letter to Sojka. Broadt's concern was that stu dents could bypass the University lottery by simply living off campus with friends who own property. Most members of the Borough Council support the proposal. Broadt pointed out, however, that ""those that live in the neighborhoods that have the most problems feel that it doesn't go far enough."" James Lee, a member of the Borough Council, raised concerns over the number of students who will still be allowed to live in town, even with the proposed restrictions. ""One of the real disappointments I had in talking to Bucknell was about reduc ing the number of students living in town,"" he said. Rather than a reduction in off- campus housing, Lee sees an ""in creased number of single family houses that are being bought by stu dents or students' parents."" ""When students live in great numbers in the community it dis rupts the community,"" he said, pointing to problems with property maintenance, parking, congestion and noise. Nonetheless, Lee said he does support the proposal. to start. If you grew up and will be living in the greater Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Wilmington, Baltimore, Washington D .

I,"May 3 , 199 The Bucknellian Page 3 Colin Bridgewater/The Bucknellian Director of Security and Safety Vince DeCerchio, expressed concern over the BYOB concept at Bucknell. He hopes to work with Student Life and local fraternity chapters to improve the system before the fall."
Racial overtones,
mar student clash,"By Andrew Cohen and Mark Abrahamsen Staff Writers An altercation with racial overtones has led to charges within the University against Colin Barker '94, according to Dave Betsill '94. The incident occurred early Sunday morning between Edwards House and Vedder Hall on Sixth Street. Barker was contacted by The Bucknellian and declined to com ment. Betsill, who filed the com- . plaint, explained that he was walk- 1 ing toward Edwards House from the freshman quad and saw two indi viduals walking toward Smith Hall from Edwards House. One of them, whom Betsill identified as Barker, ""was spitting at first repetitiously, sort of at me, and when I turned around I saw him looking at me,"" said Betsill. ""I didn't say anything to him, I kept walking and he said 'Yeah, that's what I thought, just keep walking.'"" Betsill and Barker then began exchanging words and, according to Betsill, Barker said, ""How did you get in to this school?"" Later, ""I heard him say 'you black...' something, but I didn't hear what he said be cause I was too busy screaming back at him,"" said Betsill. At this point, several of Betsill's friends from Edwards House came outside and joined him. 'They walked up in [Barker's] face,"" said Betsill, at which point ""[Barker] said 'I'll take my boy on one-on- one,' and he pushed me and that's when my friends jumped in."" Betsill"

"DeCerchio, campus leaders",
reflect upon BYOB trial weekend,By Timothy Kirk Staff Writer Student response to this last weekend's trial implementation of the Fraternity Insurance Purchasing Group (FIPG) N e W S '
BYOB,party
Analysis,"policy was not ........... .. # favorable, if party attendance is any indication. Students and administrators are presently assessing the results of the weekend and discussing alterna tives to improve the policy, which the IFC has stated will be mandatory next semester. Denis Maguire '93, president of the Inter-fraternity Council (IFC), said, ""I think we learned a lot from the trial weekend. The big problem in the future is going to be convinc ing the entire campus, not just the Greeks, that BYOB is a reality that we must accept The fraternities still feel it is their obligation to provide the alcohol, but come next semester that has to change."" Jason Besz, social chairman for Theta Chi, says student turnout this weekend confirmed campus sentiments of dissatisfaction with the policy. ""There was basically no sup port for the weekend,"" stated Besz. ""Turnout at the uphill houses was extremely low, in some cases in the single digits."" Director of Security and Safety Vince DeCerchio says the blame cannot fall entirely onto the shoulders of Bucknell fraternities or the IFC. ""It seems there was some con fusion among the fraternities as to how BYOB should work,"" noted DeCerchio. ""Most parties were ei ther very quiet or non-existent. The confusion is clearly due to the fact that the national fraternity organiza tions passed the responsibility on to the local chapters and the University without giving a workable plan for BYOB."" The BYOB policy is mandated by the insurance liabilities which exist for the national fraternities, yet there has been little if any national participation in the BYOB policy at Bucknell. 'This is a new policy for many fraternities on campus,"" said Besz. ""You can't expect to make an execu tive decision at the top and have all the details and changes be imple mented at the grass-roots level."" DeCerchio finds the policy also raises fears concerning con sumption in alternate locations."
Jenks announces,
retirement plans,"injured his knee trying to break up the incident between his friends and Barker. After the fight was broken up, Betsill filed a report with both the University and East Buffalo Town ship Police. Sid Jamieson, coach of the lacrosse team for which Barker was the starting goalie, was notified about the incident. As a conse quence, Jamieson suspended Barker from play for the remainder of the lacrosse season after ""we had a con versation with him about his behav ior, during which time he indicated that he was inebriated and had got ten into a conflict with other stu dents,"" noted Jamieson. Jamieson stressed that the sus pension was not due to the potential racial character of the incident, and said, ""It would not be appropriate to comment on something that we just were not a party to."" Although Barker's suspension from the lacrosse team did not result from the charges of racial harass ment, he is not finished with the Uni versity disciplinary system. John Dunlop, dean of students, declined to comment on the incident, but he did mention that the situation was being investigated. Timothy Clark, director of mi nority student development and as sistant coach of the lacrosse team, is helping Betsill with his complaint. He declined to comment on the de tails of the case, because, ""It would really mess up the judicial process if I got into the specifics of what hap pened. I've only heard hearsay and I'm not in a position to judge."" By Darren Millman Staff Writer George Jenks, collection de velopment librarian, better known as the man who proposed the motions to abolish both Bucknell's Greek system and the campus' Reserve Of ficer Training Corps (ROTC) pro gram, has announced his intention to retire from his position at the end of the school year. Jenks expressed excitement about his decision saying, ""Early re tirement is a good deal at Bucknell."" President Sojka notified the faculty of Jenks' retirement along with the retirements of six other Uni versity employees in a memo sent earlier this week. Despite his leadership role in the faculty motions involving the Greek system and the ROTC pro gram, Jenks explained that the ac complishments he is most proud of are ""ones which deal with the li brary, although most people don't see them."" While the faculty passed Jenks' motion to abolish the Greek system, his attempt earlier this se mester to eliminate the ROTC pro gram was defeated. Referring to the ROTC motion, Jenks commented, ""It's always disappointing when you lose."" Jenks expressed his concern over the current state of affairs at Bucknell. ""I don't feel the Univer sity is heading in a good direction, but I don't think it is just Bucknell, but nationwide at colleges and uni versities."
I,"see growing vocationalism among students, and growing hierarchy among university administrations."" Jenks' wife Zoya will remain in her role as catalog librarian next semester. Although he admitted that he did not have definite plans for the immediate future, Jenks indicated that he would like to do more work with libraries."

Though the weekend was not an overwhelming success, it did serve its purpose as a ""trial"" period. ""I'm not real happy with the BYOB concept at this point,"" said DeCerchio, ""but the jury's still out. This summer I hope to work with Student Life and some of the local chapters to improve the situation be fore next fall."" Maguire stated, ""There is some major work to be done by the fraternities.

Damage to Ku,
waiti oil fields,"The fires which Saddam Hussein's retreating army set in oil fields in Kuwait are not only burning millions of dollars an hour, but are also destroying the natural balance of the fields themselves. Officials now say that al though the fires may be extin guished, the damage will cost Ku wait far more than it can stand to lose,' for even if they can make the oil rise to the surface, it will be of lower quality than it was previously, thereby causing a decline in its value. The natural gas which once pumped the oil is being burned away, along with other natural fea tures miles below the Kuwaiti desert. Although the oil fields were once predicted to have a life of 100- years, experts now express alarm due to the possibility of that figure dropping by as much as a third. Kuwaiti fire fighters are bat tling the flames, but they lack the equipment to effectively stop the blaze. Says James Plack, a consult ant with Cambridge Energy Re search Associates, ""The slow pace [of the fire fighting] is disheartening to watch."""
Cyclone hits,
Bangladesh,"Millions of people were left homeless and at least 1,000 people were killed as a powerful cyclone pounded Bangladesh for more than fight hours. Five thousand fisher men alone were reported missing. Bangladesh is among the world's poorest and most densely populated nations. Thus, many people of this low-lying tropical country must inhabit the coastal area and islands that are so frequently prone to floods and other natural ca lamities. The storm has caused nearly $1 billion in damage and battered 14 southeastern coastal regions. The storm had winds up to 14 m.p.h. and brought waves 20 feet high, uproot ing trees, telephone lines, and elec tricity poles. Prime Minister Khaleda Zia called an emergency meeting of her Cabinet to discuss re lief measures and appeal for interna tional help."
U.S. troops to be,
replaced by UN,"Members of the United Na tions Security Council are trying to reach agreement on creating a United Nations police force in northern Iraq to replace Americans and allied military forces. The idea of a police force, rather than a full-pledged peace keeping force, in Iraq would prevent new debate on whether intervention in Iraq's affairs can be authorized without a request from the Baghdad Government and would provide protection for the Kurds. U.N. peacekeeping forces consist of uniformed soldiers from military units of member countries. The have automatic weapons, ar mored vehicles, and artillery. The U.N. police are drawn from civilian forces, carry sidearms, and wear arm bands. American forces would not be immediately involved if such a po lice force is established. This would clear the predicament for the United States of having to leave large num bers of American troops committed to Northern Iraq."
Federal Interest,
Rates cut,"The Federal Reserve has low ered the discount rate, the rate it charges on loans to banks, to 5.5 percent from 6 percent to try to end the recession. Central banks also have pushed down important Fed eral Funds rate, the rate banks charge each other on loans, to 5.7S percent from 6 percent Both of these rates affect what banks pay for deposits and other funds, and what they can then charge when they lend out this money. The cut was made because the Federal Reserve, as well as the credit markets, felt that recent data showed that the economy was still very weak. Some policy makers have asked questions, but none reportedly objected to the Federal Funds rate cut."

Tanner alleged that on August 19, 1972, President Cyert made sexual advances toward her, result ing in a forced escape by Tanner. She asserted that Cyert later at tempted to remove her from her po sition as financial administrator and financial assistant to the president, deciding not to fire her only after she received legal advise and her lawyer discussed the situation with Cyert. From that point, Tanner said that she was given very little ""real"" work to do, and that, when she was asked to leave in 1988, it was be cause of the 1972 even with Cyert.

College appli,
cations decline,"Applications are down, says the Department of Education, as the Post-Baby Boom Era is nearly at its end. Most public and private schools have felt the drop of incom ing students, some by nearly 15 percent. In 1991, there will be only 2.5 million high school graduates, 200,000 less than 1990. Those re searching the decline say the num bers should continue to drop until 1994. Locally, Susquehanna Uni versity has already experienced a lower number of applications for in- coming freshmen, but officials at the institution say that they will not lower their acceptance levels, as they want to maintain the quality of their students regardless of the quantity. --National Student News Service"
Students fight,
for Fla. Bottle Bill,"Students from Florida State University, the University of South Florida, and Florida International University, are merely a few of the campuses involved in the Florida Public Interest Research Group's (PIRG) drive to implement a Bottle bill in Florida. This Bill would place a five- cent deposit on cans and bottles sold in the state, in the hopes that recy cling will increase. The main problem that PIRG faces is trying to receive the agree ment of the retail and beverage in dustries. Says Mike Brustad, Florida PIRG's organizing director, ""they just don't want to be told they have to recycle."" Similar Bottle Bills are now enforced in nine states."

Further more, blacks are still being discrimi nated against because of stereotypes still existing from the past.

Fear rises due to,
incinerators,"One portion of the army, $200 billion project to prevent the spread of poisons and clear up its contami nated bases and munitions factories is falling years behind in schedule, experiencing huge cost increases, and causing public protests throughout six states and the South pacific. The Army's program to incin erate enormous piles of waste and deadly weapons of the cold war is being plagued also by flaws in de sign and operation. The proposed burning of such material is in agree ment with a treaty signed last June with the Soviet Union to bum all mustard gas and nerve agents. This 60 to 70 million pounds of the world's deadliest chemicals are to be burned in nine incinerators, eight of which are to be built at military bases in the United States. Incineration is believed to be more reliable and safer than any other technology, and the risk of an accident during incineration is smaller than if these chemicals were left unattended. However, residents of these proposed incinerator sights are fearful of their creation. Resi dents from Arkansas, Colorado, In diana, Kentucky, Maryland, Oregon, and Johnston Atoll in the South Pa cific feel that incinerators are areas of potential problems and a threat to a way of life. Only Alabama and Utah have showed overwhelming support for the incinerators. All International and National News Briefs are precis of New York Times articles.

Highlighting the concert will be ""Totem,"" choreographed by As sistant Director of Dance Danna Frangione and Todd Rosenleib '89. The piece, created during the ""Roel Intensive '91"" January program, uti lizes post-modern Brazilian music by Uakti to celebrate the themes of ritual possession and death. The Photo by Debra Cook Pictured above is guest artist Peter Roel, featured in the quartet ""To tem,"" choreographed by Danna Fangione and Todd Rosenlieb '89. ""Totem"" will be performed in the Buckneil Dance Company Spring Concert. work features guest artist Peter Roel, principal dancer with New York's Elisa Monte Company, and Todd Rosenleib, M.F.A. Dance candidate at New York University, as tribal demons and Tina Henninger '91 and Sharon Nichols '91 as the possessed celebrants. Mask designs by Associ ate Professor of Theatre F. Elaine Williams and lighting by Steven Draheim help lend an eerie quality to this primitive work. Guest artist Roel choreo graphed ""Ajar"" during this same January Dance Intensive. The work's musical score, created and performed by saxophonist Marcel Van Rootselaar and cellist Michelle Kinney, was commissioned espe cially for Roel by the Dance Com pany. The abstract modem piece, featuring Rosenlieb and six female dancers, creates images of positive and negative space with the dancers' bodies. Assistant Professor of Dance Shellie Cash-Muller will premier a classical ballet about joy and spring time.

Am erican Film,
musical succeeds,"By Karen Ebersold Staff Writer The musical comedy A His tory of the American Film, brought to Bucknell's stage by the depart ment of theatre and dance, de lighted and entertained audiences during Parents' Weekend. The play was a fun and un usual blend of serious cinematic history from its earliest beginnings, and satirical humor. Tied into a se ries of scenes enveloping all of the classic film genres into short skits were the charming characters of Loretta, Jimmy, Bette, and Eve who spoofed the American ideals of the Big Screen. Performances by Valerie Marsden *93, Andrew Garman '92, and Penelope Kokines '91 stood out as they brought life to movie stereotypes of cowboys, gangsters, showgirls, and war heroes. A par ticular crowd pleaser was a ""Salad"" chorus number in which characters were adorned with various veg etables and sang of the virtues of salad with full sincerity. The play took familiar scenes from movies past and em phasized the stereotypical roles of the black southern maid, the rich and flighty heiress, the escaped convict, the simple country folk, and the insane alcoholic. They led the audience through the war and the communist interrogations, all with the backdrop of the movie the atre and the fans who flocked to its seats to get lost in its fantasy. The play was cleverly done, complete with a 'The End"" sign lowering after every scene to close each story. In the final scene, the ""The End"" sign crumbled and came crashing down. Symbolic? In any case, the play was an entertain ing success, well-deserved by the talented ensemble that brought it to life."

The Bucknellian,
"May 3, 1991",
Checking out the local grocery,
stores:,"By Sue Basalla and David Murray Staff Writers Annoyed by long lines and high prices at Weis markets, two re porters from The Bucknellian de cided to investigate other less-fre quented stores in search of a better shopping experience. We toured three local super markets (Weis Markets, Acme Supersaver and Giant Supermarket) to compare the prices and services of each store. The prices for items on a randomly assembled list (see sidebar) proved that Giant was roughly 15% cheaper than the other stores. Following are some of the authors' personal reactions to each store:"
r,
squashes,
Weis,"Giant: The Clear Winner The Giant grocery store in Northumberland (across from Tedd's Landing) was cleaner, better stocked and had more variety than any of the other stores we visited. The produce section was lush and green and the bakery and deli were attractively arranged (not to mention the free samples). The staff we en countered, manager Tom Woodring and baker Alice Kline, answered our questions cheerfully. Giant offers many special cus tomer services: shallow yet spacious carts equipped with child safety seats, a frozen yogurt machine, $.03 return of plastic bags, cheap movie rentals ($.99 if not a new release), and a whole health and beauty sec- tion the size of a drug store. Another 12 i - plus: all the items in the store actu ally have price stickers on them... just like the good old days! The foyer of the store features a market-basket comparison (liter ally--the carts are right there) of Gi ant vs. Acme and Giant vs. Weis. When we visited (the display changes every month), the sample basket of groceries cost $12.92 more at Acme and $11.58 more at Weis. Two problems with shopping at this otherwise wonderful store are the lack of both a salad bar and a nearby MAC machine. Also, the drive to Giant is about ten minutes from campus, but definitely worth the trip considering the low prices and the wide variety! Plus, you can pick up a Little Caesar's pizza next door..."

Although prices are far higher at Weis than at Giant, the Big Top and Weis Quality brands help bring down your grocery bill. The new and extremely conve nient pay-with-your-MAC-at-the- register policy eliminates the anxiety of trying to add up your groceries before check out. For those of you into collecting S&H Green Stamps, Weis is the only store of the three to offer these potential purchasing points. After visiting Giant, however, Weis's produce looked tired and the bakery items seemed less attractive (maybe it was just the late '60s de cor. ..). The variety and quantity of items on the shelves also seemed to be lacking in comparison to Giant. As for customer service, we ap- Photo by David Murray In comparing three local grocery stores, Bucknellian reporters dis covered a bonus at the Giant bakery -  free samples, preached the store manager who told gloom we had difficulty even find- us that he could not answer any questions. He gave us a phone num ber to reach a customer service rep resentative and told us that no pho tographs could be permitted inside the store. Acme: Hello? Anybody home? Dark, silent and empty, the Acme store, down the road from Weis, offers an eerie shopping expe rience. During our time in the store, we only encountered three other cus tomers... and they looked a little spooked themselves. Supposedly Acme has a great deli, but in the ing the counter. When we finally did locate it, however, there was no one working there. The customer service desk was also deserted--we waited at the desk for five minutes and then gave up, having never been noticed. Acme's prices are lower than Weis', for the most part, and the shelves are generally well-stocked. This abundance of items is hardly surprising, though, since the store is not exactly bustling with customers. Other bonuses: no lines at the check out, and lots and lots of empty park ing spaces."

Senior soars the skies of Selinsgrove,
Jeff Lee '91 began flying to overcome fear of small planes,
The Collegiate Perspective,
(and other fairy tales...),"By Cindy Levinson Staff Writer For some people, the thought of flying a plane never occurs to them until their college years when they begin to broaden their horizons. But for Jeff Lee '91, ""flying"" has been a household word for as long as he can remember. Jeff has only been flying for a year and a half, but his father flew for Eastern Airlines for over 20 years, and his brother Jim Lee '90 is currently working as a flight instructor. Jeffs father tried to spark an interest in flying when Jeff was about 16, but the flying bug just was not in him. At that point in time, Jeff did not have confidence in himself that he would be able to get his pilot's license. It was not until his sophomore year at Buckncll that Jeff took a sec ond look at the opportunity to learn to fly. At that time, Jeff had decided to take flying lessons to overcome his fear of small planes. After a few lessons, Lee realized that he wanted to go on to get his license. So, during the summer following his sopho more year, Lee spent five intense weeks getting his license. Lee said his father was both supportive and helpful throughout the entire pro cess. His dad's interest in Lee's fly ing continued beyond just getting the license. Lee has been fortunate enough to have his father's Piper comanche here at Bucknell. The Comanche is a four-person, 180- horsepower plane with retractable gear. Jeff has gained the majority of his experience and logged in most of his flying hours in this plane. Lee keeps the Comanche in Selinsgrove and flics it about once a week. During the past year and a half, these trips have taken him around Lewisburg and as far as Nan tucket, Martha's Vineyard, Hartford, Albany, Baltimore, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and even to State College for an occasional dinner (flight time: 15 minutes). Although he has been trained to deal with emergencies, Lee has had his share of frightening experi ences in the air. On his first solo flight, he had complete radio failure. While on a night-time trip, Lee ex perienced alternator failure and could have lost all navigational power. Fortunately, Lee managed a safe emergency landing at the next airport. He credits his pilot training with helping him control his panic in these potentially disastrous situa tions. Throughout it all, Lee has only had to worry about the cost of gas. All storage and maintenance costs are covered by his father. Lee real izes that he will probably have to re turn his plane to his father upon graduating from Bucknell because he probably will not be able to af ford the fees Since his time at Bucknell is rapidly dwindling, he plans to get as much use out of the plane in the next month as he possibly can. Lee said, ""If you look up and hear a plane, chances are, it'll be me."" Although Lee thoroughly en joys flying, he does not view it as one of his top career choices. Lee realizes that being a commercial pi lot for a large airline is not as glam orous as it appears. He views the profession as similar to that of a ""a well-paid bus driver."" (This is not to say that he does not respect the pro fession, however. His father enjoyed working for Eastern and his brother looks forward to sending his resume to large airlines in the fall.) Lee sees the career as being to dependent upon others for his tastes. He is look ing for a job that would ""affix'd [him] the opportunity to write [his] future, something you can't do as a pilot"" Lee also commented that he is ""not as keen on the joy of flight as some people are...I appreciate the practical aspects of it...I hate to be stuck in one spot."" Lee is more inter ested in experiencing a variety of exciting sports, rather than concen trating upon one. He sees his hobbies of flying, scuba diving, sailing, and sky diving as ""things you can do that put a little interest in your life."" Other ""interesting"" sports that Lee would like to try his hand at are bungee jumping and hang-gliding, so if you have any of those ""living on the edge"" hobbies and need a partner, Lee is the one to call. Photo courtesy of G eoff Stewart Pictured here with his Piper Comanche, Jeff Lee '91 describes himself as ""not so keen on the joy of flight as some people are...I appreciate the practical aspects of it. I hate to be stuck in one spot."" Lee occasion ally escapes Lewisburg by flying to State College for dinner. r ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"

DISTINCTIVE CATERING,"* Graduation Parties * Dinner Parties Hors D'oeuvres * Party Platters * Luscious Desserts * Creative Salads By Peter Lalos Staff Writer Student Requalification Exam: Spring 1991 semester Only a perfect score on this examination will qualify students for readmittance to the university for the following year. Testing time: 25 minutes Number of questions: 6 1) The most vital social con cern facing Bucknellians during the 1990-1991 school year was: a) Trying to keep track of what POWER, FAG, FLAG, AHCHA, STOP, ROTC, and BYOB stood for, both figuratively and literally. b) Morale problems due to lack of available controversy on campus. c) Evading the draft d) Breaking in the new Bison to give it that ""lived in"" look. e) A healthy quantity of the above, if taken in moderation. 2) The number ""2"" repre sents: a) The number of seniors who have been accepted for em ployment positions after their graduation this year. b) The number of students who have the guts to openly admit that they are card-holding members of FAG. c) The projected amount of money (in dollars) that the univer sity hopes to receive from Greek alumni over the next ten years. d) The number of months before STOP will realize that the Gulf war is over, and give it a rest e) F, G, and M. 3) The sentiment most likely not to be overheard on Bucknell's campus is which of the following? a) ""Oh, I don't imagine Mr. Jenks would object to the construc tion of the new R.O.T.C. barracks behind the Bertrand Library."" b) ""Well, I for one don't mind spreading that gelatinous yel low stuff in the caf s mayonnaise bin on my BLT's."" c) 'The great thing is, none of my finals fall on the same day!"" d) ""And if you win the tour nament, ladies, we'll play quarters the whole bus ride home!"" e) ""My schedule for next se mester? Did it in five minutes. No problem."" f) ""What's this grainy white substance under my feet on the sidewalk?"" 4) The recent outbreak of vandalism across campus is most likely due to the fact that'"
V____________________,"a) Everyone knows that the benches in the academic quad are more comfortable to sit in if they're upside-down. b) The shoplifting ring in the bookstore just didn't fly like people expected it to. c) Everybody's running around butt naked with BB guns in California- They say it's gonna be bigger than foozball in a couple of years, dude! d) It's...It's...It's the recession...There, I said it!"
"WE'RE IN A RECESSION,","OKAY? e) All of the majority. 5) Those students found to be chronically complaining about life at Bucknell should take which of the following courses of action for best results? a) Join the whining team, which is to be sanctioned as a var sity sport here as of the 1991- 1992 school year. b) Keep up the good work- you're making life so enjoyable for the rest of us. c) Take part in another spir ited activity for releasing pent-up stress- like dodging traffic on Route 15 with a blindfold on. d) TRANSFER. e) A, C, and...oh, what's the use? No one's going to read this, I can't find a date for formats, and my G.P.A. is drop ping like Kuwaiti oil stock. Life slinks. 6) The university's endow ment is characteristically weak because: a) Whenever we hold fundraisers featuring former U.S. presidents, riots seem to break out. b) Alumni support has been linked to cancer. c) Squirrels! d) This nutty Disney- Muppets controversy...I think that I can safely say that it's thrown us all for a bit of a loop. What can you believe in these days? e) A smidgen of the hori zontal. Extra Credit: Name the next site on campus that is due for either renovation or construction in the near future (This should be a freebee for everyone, mainly since any answer will inevitably be correct). When you have completed this examination and turned it in to psychological services, you are free to leave the campus for the year. And HEY!-Be careful out there."

Speaking on diversity,
. .The dream of racial amity--of blacks and whites learning and playing together--seems,
"sadly elusive,"" reported Tom Morganthau in this week's",
Newsweek,
"article entitled ""Race on",
"Campus: Failing the Test?""",
The alleged racial harassment incident that occurred this Sunday is a clear reminder that,
Bucknell suffers from the same race relation problems that Morganthau describes as afflicting,
all American colleges and universities.,
A recent incident at Brown University highlights the conflict between protecting the rights,
of minorites on campus and protecting free speech. Brown's administration expelled Douglas,
"Hann after the junior was found guilty of yelling anti-black, anti-Semitic, and anti-homosexual",
"epithets, his second violation of Brown's anti-harassment rule. Brown's definition of ""harass",
"ment"" has infringed upon his rights of free speech. Indeed it is ironic that Brown's administra",
"tion is trying to respect the rights of minorites, but, in the same stroke, they are squelching",
diversity of speech and thought.,
Although students and other members of the campus community should have an overriding,
"right of expression, no matter how unpleasant that expression may be, harassing individuals is",
"beyond the scope of that right. Harassment is the persistent annoyance of an individual, not a",
group.,
It would be a terrible mistake for Bucknell to use the Brown example as a precedent; the,
administration must recognize the,
prima facie,
importance of free speech and diverse thought.,
Yet at the same time assaults such as the one last weekend must not go unpunished.,
"While racially motivated incidents of violence are rare at Bucknell, no one could deny that",
this campus is far from achieving racial harmony. The University must protect a student's right,
to speak freely even though it has no constitutional obligation to do so.,
"On the other hand, when actions are directed against a particular individual, it is clear that",
the perpetrator has no place at any institution of higher education.,
Diversity without tolerance and mutual respect will do little more than tear the campus,
"community apart. One would hope that racism, sexism, and homophobia will eventually lose out",
"in the market of ideas, but as Voltaire said, ""I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the",
"death your right to say it.""",
"Matt Meritt '91 has introduced a BSG resolution which ""urges the university to adopt a free",
speech code by which various forms of communication...are protected and are allowed to be,
"exercised regardless of their content."" It is time that Bucknell put its far-reaching commitment to",
"free speech in writing--now is not the time to mandate politically correct speech, as Brown has",
done.,

Editorial upsets reader,"To the Editor: While I have read a number of similar paeans to the ""great university"" we call Bucknell in the well-managed pages of public relations publications, I would not have expected to hear such hollow rhetoric from the editorial board of the Bucknellian. Surely Travis Elliott and my peers know that there is more to a university than million dollar projects and greek pacifism. Surely, to your minds, there are a few other things encom-"
"""I would not",
have expected,
to hear such,
hollow rhetoric,
from the edito,
rial board of the,
"Bucknellian.""","passed in being a great university. As I said, 1 have read such sad words about what consti tutes Bucknell's greatness in other publica- .... tions and in other forums. The one that I most remember, though, was a press guide to the 1990 Patriot League football season. The folks at the Patriot League had been decent enough to allow each university a page of space to talk about what they were and what they valued. Given this opportunity, Bucknell used about 50 of its 300 or so words to make a few perfunctory remarks about teaching and, then, went on to discuss at length buildings and dollar figures. This was indeed sad, I thought, but perhaps to be ex pected from a nervous middle class university that, like so many of the students it attracts, all too often confuses wealth and expen diture with quality. Yet, to see Vjhis same gesture made by my friends was disturbing. Teaching, learning, com munity, a sense of common pur pose-- these are the things, or some of the things which make a university truly great. Sadly for administrators, parents, and some students these things cannot be quantified; unlike other aspects of the university, they cannot be put into an equation which will calculate the greatness of this or any institution. All the same, I was sorry to see that they were overlooked in your editorial. _____ Yet, as I have thought since reading April 26th's essay, it could be the case that the editorial was an extremely clever attempt to point out the inanity of an institution which thinks it can demon strated greatness by pointing to its balance --i - sheet and to the accu mulation of bricks and mortar. Perhaps the editorial was also intended to show, by means of deviously eliciting positive reactions from visiting parents, how so many of these people are educational consum ers in the worst sense. If this is the case, bravo to the editorial board, I say. Then indeed, it was a masterful essay. But I might add that, if this was the intent of your editorial, you could leave a few more hints of your irony, a few more sugges tions of your true purpose. Such careless readers as myself need help at times and, as we all know, no one likes being left out of a joke. Michael McGandy GR April 28,1991"

Student questions validity of,
MG 101 and newspaper article,"To the Editor: Socrates may have been only mortal, but he still gave out some damn good advice. Take for ex ample, what he tells Hippocrates, a budding young scholar, in the Protagoras: ""...something which you value more highly than your body, namely your soul -- some thing on whose beneficial or harm ful treatment your whole welfare depends..."" Sure, I just quoted Socrates, and I happen to be a philosophy major. While not knowing the meaning of life, I do know a few things about Bucknell life. A aes thetically beautiful school mired in problems, but still a good place to get an education. Maybe. Bucknell has got its educa tional difficulties to work out, but it certainly does not need The Buck nellian adding fuel to the prover bial fire. Which, is exactly what your paper did on April 26 with your larger than life feature on Professor John Miller and Manage ment 101. I have many problems with you giving such heralded press to this specific class. Primarily be cause MG 101 just does not deserve it. After reading last Friday's fea ture page, some might think MG 101 should be a graduation requirement More realistically, the two articles may have encouraged someone to take the class. I find this highly irresponsible writing such high praises without any criti cal review of this class. Mainly because through experience and interaction with others, I have heard more complaints about this one class than any other. It is in this spirit that I would like to describe the problems with the class that ""leaves an impression."" Taking the downside of MG101 into consider ation, it did not really warrant the Bucknellian's publicity. As stated in Susan Smith's article, when John Miller started his brainchild he ""felt that all liberal arts students, not just business majors should be exposed to the basic of management."" Yet MG101 is al ways loaded with BSBA wanna be's. This is due to the obvious fact that MG 101 is a requirement for admission into the business program at Bucknell University. Now why is MG 101 a requirement for BSBA applicants if the course was sup posed to be geared for liberal arts students? Won't these future busi ness students learn the basics of management in the BSBA degree requirements: Marketing, Financial Accounting, Management Science, Micro-Economic Theory, Finance, etc? I guess pre-business majors must be in the class for learning how ""emotionally engaging, how inter esting it is to work with other people."" While this statement by Professor Miller is absolutely true, I really doubt if MG101 is the place where Bucknellians learn to work with other people. Yes, I was emo tionally engaged (as if I normally am not) when I took the class. Yes, there is more student interaction in MG101 than most other classes. Yes, a group of people accomplish things, they could not do indepen dently. And finally Yes, the MG 101 students manage in the literal sense .-- they get things done through people. However I feel that the only reason people get things done, and perhaps appear to be learning about working with people, is because there is a common desire to do well gradewise. Why did the MG 101 student cross the road? Perhaps a worker incentive was on the other side, maybe a better grade. The fact is competition for good grades drives MG 101.1 wonder how much would get done in MG101 compa nies if Professor Miller closed his first lecture of the semester with this announcing, ""And remember, no matter what happens in your company, everyone will get an A."" I wonder what the class would be like if just liberal arts majors took it. I think MG 101 invented the term cutthroat"" and its no wonder HRM divisions, excuse me, departments spend so much on neck bandages. The MG101 grading logic amounts to that not only will companies be rated, but there will be individual See MG101, p. 10"

World community's future,
may be In jeopardy,"By Joyce Dollinger Right now we are in a eu phoric, hopeful period because of all the wonderful changes that have oc curred in the world. There is unlim ited optimism: the Persian Gulf War and the cold war has ended, the bi polar system has changed, the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. are cooperating with each other in a friendly manner, and the Berlin Wall has fallen. It is as if these awesome things will keep going on and on and the world will keep becoming better and better. Unfortunately, this optimistic period and this euphoria could be shorter lived then anticipated. If we want to leant from the past mistakes in the global world system, we should ""so berly"" look what is happening today, and realize that the future might not be as great as one might think. Thus, there are a number of trends and pat terns that exist that one could argue are more likely to create problems then they are to solve problems. In my opinion, government, corporation, and people should have a right to industrialize, produce, and consume as much as they want, un less their actions damage the basic environment, such as: air, land, and water. Therefore, all global citizens have the moral obligation to pre serve the quality of the environment, to allow for the quality of life. My philosophical approach is that of utilitarianism, in that justice provides, ""the greatest good or hap piness for the greatest number of people in a given society"" stated on a value source sheet I was given by. one of my professors. And as this value source sheet concludes, ""de termining the greatest good for the greatest number could be done in a variety of ways, including a major ity electoral or legislative vote, pub lic opinion polling, a panel of wise judges or analysts of human needs, or a group of psychologists who 'know' what makes most people happy"". People keep thinking that technology is going to rescue us, yet we are entrapped in a self-defeating technology trend. Utilitarians would argue that people would benefit from technology, since government and public opinion vote for a mechani cal, orientated world. However, the trap we are in is that: for every tech nological solution, we create a sig nificant problem., For example, many peopled thought that the nuclear plant revolution was going See WORLD, p. 10"
Culture shock awaits those,
returning from abroad,"By Lisa Hirschkorn WARNING: 1 am one of the 99 Bucknellians who studied abroad last semester and my ""culture shock"" could be hazardous to your health. Jen Marshall's article, ""What happens when globe-trotting Buck nellians return to Lewisburg?"" al most convinced me that such a warn ing label would apply tome. But maybe it is not a bad idea. This warning would make a good button slogan which could come in handy. I could wear the button next to my so rority pin, for example, and our forty-seven new pledges wouldn't feel bad about not knowing my name. With this button, some one other than my five apartment mates will understand why they haven't seen me on campus for a while. God,' I will even be relieved of hearing the faux-pas question, ""Have you been abroad?"" Maybe Jen did us a favor by sounding the culture shock alarm. As I stroll around campus next Septem ber my friends will already know that I ""... could be experiencing these same re-entry problems right [at that] very second."" Thanks, Jen. I imagine that returning to Bucknell and to America will be a strange experience. We will obvi ously have to adjust. As I am still in Europe right now, I can only imag ine what is to come. But it must be weird to re-embrace a society you have known all of your life and face difficulties accepting it We will definitely be affected"

Furthermore, we will feel this shock at two levels - at Bucknell and at home. Jen Marshall's article, how ever, definitely exaggerated my ex pectations. I think her view pertains to students who have studied abroad for a whole years. From my under standing, these students sometimes don't go home until the academic year ends.

As Jen Marshall did, I have immersed myself in a European cul ture. With just one month to go, I can say that I have benefited greatly from this abroad experience. But for me the culture of France is a constant shock. I have lived with a French family for the past three months and still can't name the cheeses we _ _ eat at dinner. At the same time, it is the challenge of understanding the Eu ropeans which makes living here so exciting. An abroad experience means leaving many memories of Bucknell temporarily behind.

He is three time contender for the ""Principal Johnson Award Noting Teaching Excellence."" He has also achieved the prestigious ""Teacher Of The Month"" trophy an undisputed THREE times. Re cently, he won a hard fought victory over Jake ""The Snitch"" Brondersky's father in a heated par ent-conference. Please welcome, la dies and gentlemen, Mike ""The Hammer"" Williams. Let's get right to the point, shall we? Last month you suffered what many thought to be a career ending injury, is that right? Yeah, well. I cut myself with the paper cutter, when I was trim ming some dittos I had mimeo graphed. It wasn't really all that bad. Yes, but it was it your chalk board writing arm, wasn't it? Uh, yeah it was my right arm. Now, you've had troubles T"""
C O .,"with that arm in the past. I guess. It got caught in the Xerox machine a few months ago. But it seems like you've com pensated for this devastating series of injuries by dazzling the fans with some astounding left arm work. Um, for a while I had to use my left hand when I graded papers and stuff, if that's what you mean. And what a commendable performance you gave, Hammer! Uhh, thanks. Now let's talk about your most recent bout with Bobby ""The Bull"" Hackenschliemer shall we? Okay. You showed some dazzling footwork and catlike reflexes. It was a truly phenomenal battle, why don't you tell the viewers your own per ceptions of the triumph. Well, Bobby was about to throw an eraser at Susan, and he was in the back of the room, so I had to sort of dodge around all the desks and pull the eraser out of his hand. And what a commendable performance it was. Hammer! Did you knock him out, after your risky first attack.? Did you end his career? I sent him to the principal's office. He seemed pretty sorry af terwards. He's basically a pretty good kid. I see. Let's talk contracts, shall we Hammer. Now as we both know, Evander ""The Real Deal"" Holyfield received a cool 12 million after he punched and hammered his way to a bloody victory in front of billions of adoring fans. How are your numbers looking? Actually, not bad. This year I'll be making a little over twenty thou' a year. Uhhh great. Are you taking on any major endorsements? Endorsements? Yes, you know. All great role- models do endorsements. Muhammed Ali. Sugar Ray Leonard. ""Iron"" Mike Tyson even has his own boxing video game where kids can beat up guys just like he does. Well, I supervise the patrols. Super. Why don't you tell us how it feels when you look out from your desk, and you know its just you against that classroom. Like Ali vs Frazier or Holyfield vs Foreman or Bush vs Hussein. How does it feel? I never really looked at it that way. Hammer, I was talking to box ing legend James ""Buster"" Douglas, last week. He told me the greatest moment in his career was when he beat champion Mike Tyson down to a bloody pulp in front of a packed arena. What would you say was the greatest moment of your career? Well, I've taught a bunch of kids how to read. Uhhh. Yeah. That's really uhhh great. ...And we'll be right back with more action after these beer com mercials featuring bikini-clad women bringing booze to sweaty men.

World,"From page 9 to provide us with inexhaustible heat energy. But once we moved into the nuclear plant age, we recognized that we had not foreseen the negative consequences of rising prices, the possibility of nuclear meltdowns, nuclear pollution, and the radioac tive material that we had not figured out how to dispose of. So, as an American, I believe in gaining as much knowledge about nuclear tech nology as one can, but if this wisdom starts to infringe on the environment, experiments in the nuclear field should come to a halt. The global world should start to obtain knowl edge in sources which will not harm the Earth, such as solar and wind power. In this way, by creating bet ter energy sources to prevent a nuclear holocaust would be the ""greatest good for the greatest num ber of people"". Since we do no know if there , will be slight chance that a nuclear holocaust can occur, which may lead to extinction, we cannot afford to gamble with the Earth. ""Unlike a video game where we can insert another quarter and try again when the message 'GAME OVER' flashes on the screen, we only have one Earth and when the game is over, it's over,"" my friend, Mollie Legg '94 stated. Then, the Green Revolution was solicited as a solution to the malnutrition and hunger problem throughout the whole third world in the 1960's. The Green Revolution has helped build up agriculture pro duction in many third world coun tries, but the longer term effects were to find a quite adverse solution be cause it contributed to soil leeching and soil erosion. Also from the Green Revolution, the soil, water, and land pollution from the pesti cides destroy some of the produce as well as some of the farmers and their children. The farmers find them selves becoming increasingly depen dent on them until they eventually get caught up in a seemingly never- ending cycle. The cycle is a result of the fact that agricultural chemicals become progressively more expen sive year after year, and at the same time, less efficient in improving crop production as pest become resistant to them. Yet, my utilitarian morals make me disagree with the Green Revolution. In today's society, people are generally motivated by short-term economic goals. In an ef fort to reach these profit motivated goals, producers have caused eco logically unsound changes in pro duction technology. Thus, I think that third world countries must ter minate this approach because it only benefits these nations on a short term level. If the land of the third world countries deteriorates, what will they use as a food source in the future? The land of the first world? Probably so. Then when our land weakens, what are we to use? Prob ably nothing. In this way, I propose that the government find a new solu tion - organic farming ; such as the use of manure. This involves natural methods of production and is advan tageous to both the global environ ment and the global economy. Therefore, in the long run, this will be ""the greatest good"" for the third world nations as well as the first world nations. So, ""we found that our so- called technological progress some times make it worse rather than bet ter and we get ourselves into a trap because we keep thinking that we can create better technology to solve problems and sometimes we get our selves into greater problems,"" ex plained a political science teacher. Thus, we think we can control the world. And it is tough to make far ranging decision, which can contrib ute to pessimism of the utilitarians. Through technology we also think we will find new food stuffs that will eliminate the malnutrition problem and renewable energy which will eliminate the energy problem and improve human life and leisure time which will enable people to live better lives. But also through technology that we have de veloped, such as weapons, can rap idly and more effectively kill us all. Consequently, technology has not substantially eased some of these other problems, it has just made them worse. As one can see, this is not a ""greater good"" for all peoples. Looking into the future, economies of growth, materialism, and consumption will contribute to the deteriorating environment Third world countries and first world countries are going to put pressure on resources. Thus, petroleum is go ing to keep the prices rising, and air, land, and water pollution is going to spread around the world, the ozone hole is probably going to grow, and the greenhouse effect is likely to continue to widen. All of this will contribute to economic problems, since we use resources which will rise in price which hurt the global economy and all economies. We need to create a utilitarian value sys tem of common good for all peoples, or else we will fall into a bottomless pit. Values as respect, cleanliness, and conservationism for helping the environment prosper should be initi ated for a fair international world. For so long the greater fear was that the world could end and people could be killed by nuclear in cineration. And now ecologists say we have it all wrong - maybe nuclear deterrence will prevent nuclear was among the major powers, especially since there is detente. But, if we con sider in our high-tech industrialized, consumptive, materialistic, greedy ways, we are going to ruin our envi ronment - globally as well as region ally. ""We are going to be experienc ing sufficient land, water, and air pollution, especially air pollution, that might ruin our basic ecosystem. This will make life less sustainable, since some of this deterioration is doubling at an exponential rate. There is C02 and CFC's in air and we do not know how damaging they are now. Maybe the global tempera tures are going to jump. All of this can dramatically change our lives,"" remarks the same professor. This is why I believe in utilitarianism. With out it as one of my morals, all my consumptive actions would only benefit me with happiness and all other would be miserable. Thus, the needs and wants of humanity would not be met because of my selfish ac tions. This is not an optimistic world any longer. We must act to change our lifestyles and to get involved in political and social change groups to affect the U.S. behavior to become more respectful to the environment. If the U.S. changes their greedy, con sumptive ways, this might be copied by other countries of the world to try to ""arrest:"" these negative changes and create a more satisfied, livable world for the future."

Readers respond to Jeans Day controversy,"To theEditor: 1 realize that I am beating the proverbial dead horse by putting my thoughts in print, but I felt compelled to respond to the contro versy over Jeans Day. Free speech, action, and expression are protected by the Constitution. However, we are all members of a society in which certain modes of behavior are ac cepted while certain others are regarded as unorthodox. Consider ing this in relation to the general recognition that heterosexuality is ""normal"" sexuality, the American heterosexual can take pride in his or her sexual orientation without feeling inhibited. But the homo sexual, an individual contributing to an oppressed minority, is likely to come under criticism for his or her ostracized way of life. So the A.H.C.H. A. may not realize that its actions are intensely hurtful, but any time the majority emphasizes its already distinguished power, the minority only feels more criminalized. Darren Shaw's stipu lation (The Bucknellian, April 26th) that we should all take pride in our individuality would essentially be the reflection of a secure society, but it is undoubtedly easier to pub licly take pride in yourself when so many of the people around you share your conventions. In this way pride no longer becomes a consid eration for the homosexual. Surely we have all been in the minority at some point in our lives. Maybe when we were nine going on ten we could not play basketball. No one likes being picked last for a neighborhood game of hoops. That socially ex cluded feeling instigated by a simple lack of physical ability is so very demoralizing. I can only imag ine feeling this way on a regular basis. Yet that person who lacks the physical and emotional ability to love someone of the opposite sex faces severe criticism every day of his or her life. But the homosexual's love for someone of their same sex is just as genuine as a man's for a woman or a woman's for a man. Homosexuality is not a chosen sexuality but an inherent one. I am not saying that it is easy to adjust the little world a lot of us have been raised in to accommo date propriety that is not the same as ours, not the same as most of society's for that matter. Even heterosexuals who support homo sexual liberation need to continu ally validate their sympathy and the only way this can be accomplished is through attempting to understand one another. Understanding is not a liberal or a conservative issue, nor a heterosexual or homosexual one, it is one that we need to address in order to become better people. Liz Shaw '94 April 26,1991 To the Editor: P.O.W.E.R. would like to address both Evan Maloney's and Darren Shaw's assessment of our actions with regard to Jeans Day. First of all, Evan Maloney's letter contains some errors. For example, he accuses POWER of tearing down the flyers that the Ad Hoc Committee for Heterosexual Awareness had put up. The reality is that our group did not take these signs down. In fact, your peers and professors were probably the cul prits. We have heard a number of faculty and students say that they, not POWER, tore the flyer down. Secondly, we have been accused of being ""foes of free speech"" because we responded to the AHCHA's chalkings. In fact, to Mr. Maloney, this action is reminiscent of ""Nazi book burnings"" and ""Husseins's torching o f... oil fields"". It is inter-"
Christian provides Biblical,
perspective on homosexuality,"To the Editor: The April 26 edition of The Bucknellian printed two articles which raised my attention concern ing the opposing views on campus regarding homosexuality. One view on campus supports increasing the human and civil rights of homo sexuals. It is supported primarily by the efforts of F.L.A.G. as well as other organizations and students finding this cause appealing. The other camp has recently taken a more verbal stance in its beliefs. The pro-heterosexual, not necessar ily anti-homosexual, group of stu dents started what has become a controversy at or around Jeans Day, April 17. Much has been written regarding the controversy of this issue but I find one argument sur prisingly scarce. It seems that nobody has taken the time or ventured the ef fort to print what the Bible has to say about homosexuality. As a Christian, I'm very troubled by this fact. The Bible is, in fact, very explicit about God's feelings to ward homosexuality. For those of you who could not care less what the Bible says, you can stop reading here. But for those inter ested, you may find as I have, that God's Word is the definitive answer to the ques tion at hand. It transcends all politi cal movements for or against gay rights, as well as, everything es poused by F.L.A.G. and the coun termeasure F.A.G. (Friends of Anti-Gays). Three particular Biblical references stand out in my mind regarding homosexuality. The first is Romans 1:18-32. Verse 25, ""They exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshipped and served created things rather than the Creator who is forever praised. Amen. (26) Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women ex changed natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perver sion."" Other references include 1 Corinthians 6:9-11 and 1 Timothy 9:11.1 encourage you to look them up for yourselves. I write this because I think there are people who consider themselves to be Christians but do not have the faintest notion as to God's stance on the matter. I also write to Evan Maloney, you have taken the right stance, but make sure it is backed with the right motives. As a Christian, I cannot con done or support homosexuality, not one day out of a year, not ever. The modem concepts of open-minded thinking, passivity, and permissive ness don't factor in as a consider ation. Bottom line? Christianity (the faith this school was founded upon) never calls lor hating or persecut ing homosexuals. It does, however, preclude all Christians from accept ing homosexuality as an alternative lifestyle. Christianity and homo sexuality are mutually exclusive. David Royse Joe '94 April 30,1991"
"""The Bible is, in fact,",
very explicit about,
G od's feelings toward,
"hom osexuality.""","esting to note, however, that neither Evan Maloney nor Darren Shaw were as adamant about defending the ""defacement"" of chalk talk last Spring and this past Fall while our writings were being changed by MUFF (Men Upset by Fucking Feminists), while misogynist com ments were added to them, while we watched a man urinate on one of our quotes. We did not protest to these responses, however, precisely because they were responses. Our chalk talk elicited response and reaffirmed our belief that POWER should exist on this campus. To respond to Darren Shaw's question, POWER wishes to re main anonymous because we feel that our actions are more important that our identities. For example, if one reads a poem without knowing who the poet is, that reader must determine the worth of the poem on her or his own. But if a famous name is attached to the poem, the reader often assumes that the poem must then be good. Conversely, if the reader is predisposed against the poet already, then she or he is likely to dismiss the poem. POWER requests that people would read our messages instead of asking the irrelevant question, ""Who did it?"" We do not feel that we are ashamed of our actions, or that we are ""hiding behind a piece of chalk"". On the contrary, we feel that our goal to establish dialogue in the university community has succeeded. Our chalkings and effi gies have been effective in leading people to discuss the issues of sexism and heterosexism."

MG 101,"From page 8 ratings within companies. It's really a shame if survival of the fittest is the untold lesson that Miller feels just couldn't be taught in a textbook. Everyone has a dream of the ideal thing they could spend their life doing, but there's something wrong with a society, or a professor, that just loves winners. By the way, in MG 101 terms, I'm a big loser. As CEO in the fall 1989,1 led our com pany to the lowest grade of the four companies that semester. Then, in the fall of 1990, the board of MG 101 didn't hire me has a teaching assistant. Ironi cally, it probably turned out to be the best thing that ever hap pened to me. I changed my ma jor to philosophy from account ing upon discovering the fault of classes like MG 101. Due to the class's inflexible structure and the teacher's authoritative na ture, MG101 does nothing more than fill your soul with ""knowl edge."" Of course that may seem like the point of college, but if you let me refer to Socrates again he'll have a problem with that According to Socrates, you should never go to a peddler of goods for the soul whose looking to sell you knowledge, but in stead look to find a ""physician of the soul."" I know it sound fruity, but on a campus that lists its first focus as being liberal arts, per haps Susan Smith could have written an article about a class based on creativity and not busy work. While the bigger problem may be a campus wide trend towards professionalism, the Bucknellian does not have to help create this mood.

Printed below is an excerpt from Gonzalez's story and Seibert's poem. Excerpt from The King and Me by Daniel Gonzalez From the beginning it had been the King. Not just any rock and roll star could move my wife the way Elvis did. Of course, it was Graceland. She spoke of it often. There was no decision really, only the shrieks of joy that bounced through our kitchen that afternoon. It made little difference that I'd been laid off for winter. Her mind set quickly and I knew better than to. tempt her stubbomess. Besides, it was good to see her smile again. ""Welvin, honey, I've never been to Graceland. Hell, I've wanted to go since I was a kid, you know that."" She hopped around the linoleum, kissing me sloppily between dance steps. ""Our first vacation together. Welvin, it'll be just like a honeymoon."" We had never had a honeymoon, at least not a real one. I did my best to make it up to her and collected vacation brochures, waiting for the day I would come home and spring my triumph. Today was such a day. She hugged me fiercely, kissed her finger and brought it slowly to my lips. ""I'm going to call Momma,"" she whispered. I had made her a happy woman. I leaned against our counter and played with the apples, smiling at her as she reached for the phone. My child bride, God, was she beautiful. The news would wait until after the vacation. There was plenty of time for me to find a new job before Christ mas. I'd saved for this trip and things could hold until we got back. She beamed proudly at me and I blew her a kiss. This was one time I would not make a mess of things. Cornelia at Sully Plantation-- 1803 Every afternoon the sun blew through that window and it built a buttress of dust braced against an oak H oot . And Cornelia sat with her mother's diamonds, making them dance in her palms, their prisms shattering light across her face. She held them to her tongue and her lips, and then to the window pane, holding them between the sun and her eye They scratched lines in the glass like white eyelashes. And when she began to carve the ""C"" she must have seen the front driveway, its crumbled oyster shells unravelling like a bolt of white cloth across the Virginia green. Tobacco, rows of broad leaves, green as money being piled onto carts. Slaves, an army of ants carrying loads back to a nest, their bodies sweating and fertilizing the earth. In the distance she must have seen the huts and their smoke, rising like free-floating cotton. Cornelia finished scratching the last eyelash curve to the sad and low music of her father's slaves. -James Seibert"

WB,"By Laura Grisin Staff Writer As the large crowd in the Weis Center last Friday would agree, the Bison Chips' annual Chipfest was once again a success. Featured guests this year were two all-female groups, the Bates College Merimanders and the Cornell Uni versity Touchtones. Highlighting the Meriman- der's program was ""December, 1963 (Oh, What a Night)"" by Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons, complete with '70's disco chore ography. Their encore, a song about the men who see them selves as God's gift to women, was dedicated to the women in the audience. Need less to say, this song was a hit with the predominately female crowd that had turned out to see the Chips. Cornell's Touchtones sang a selection of tunes ranging from ""Cherish"" to ""Chuckie's in Love."" A definite crowd-pleaser was their only blond member's rendition of ""'Cause I'm a Blond,"" after which she left the audience to wonder if she really is as airheaded in person as she was on stage. At intermission the Chips, never failing to surprise their audi-"

/,"ences, presented a Bugs Bunny/ Elmer Fudd cartoon entitled ""What's Opera, Doc?"" It was interesting to note that the crowd of seemingly mature and intelligent adults were in hysterics over Elmer bellowing, ""Kill the wa-a-abit, kill the wa-a- abit, KILL THE WA-A-ABIT!!"" But then again, Chipfest is meant to be a time to kick back and have fun. The second half finally brought the Chips to the stage to sing favorites like ""Moondance"" and ""You Can Call Me Al"" as well as ""Fly in Me Face"" with Chris Bowen '91 sporting a feather and fruit-topped hat with gold tassles. New tunes included Chris Williams '92 singing ""W e're Not Deep"" and An drew Lunstad '91 singing ""Hoja."" A highlight of the concert in cluded Tim ""Q-Tip"" Stahl '90's re turn to Bucknell to emcee the con cert and to sing ""Coney Island Baby"" with the Chips and other alums, Chris Waller '90 and John O'Connor '89. Be sure to catch the Bison Chips as well as Bucknell's other a cappella groups, the Harmonex, Some Singers, and the Silhouettes, at the Bison Coffeehouse on May 15."

----------------------------------------------,"- By Greg Weyant O.K., you've been studying for finals for the past three days straight. Your brain has been trans formed to strawberry jello, and you need some sort of relief before you completely break down in hysteria. Renting a movie sounds like an ex cellent outlet, but it's 11:30 at night, the video shop has long since closed, and you just blew your last 50 cents on a Pepsi. There is, however, one option you have not explored--the library. No, I'm serious. The place where you've spent the better part of your college existence has some great movies that you can take out for the night absolutely free ! As impossible as it may sound, the Bertrand Li brary does have more on video tape than just third world economic theo ries and the inner working of Con gress. Here are 10 great flicks that Bucknell owns that are yours for the borrowing any time you get the urge to just relax and zone out for a while: Young Frankenstein- This classic comedy, directed by Mel Brooks, starring Gene Wilder and Terri Garr, is a hilarious parody of the Mary Shelly tale. Psycho- Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece of suspense and horror staring Anthony Perkins. Monty Python and the Holy Grail- John Clese and the rest of the British comedy troop as King Arthur and his knights in one of the funniest movies ever made. Fatal Attraction- Michael Douglas and Glenn Close star in this Academy Award winning thriller. See this with someone you love. Last Temptation of Christ- This controversial Film from direc tor Martin Scorsese tells the tail of Christ as a mortal man. Stars Willem DaFoe. Pink Floyd: The Wall- Roger Waters' monumental rock epic. A must see for any fan. The Hunger- David Bowie and Susan Sarandon in a modern day vampire tale. Music by Bauhaus."
A,"Clockwork Orange- Adapted from the Anthony Burgess novel and directed by Stanley Kubrick, this futuristic tale of teen age gangs was nominated for ""Best Picture"" in 1971. Dr. Strangelove- Also di rected by Kubrick. Peter Sellers stars in three different roles in this black comedy about nuclear war. Mississippi Burning- Gene Hackman plays an F.B.I. agent in the mid-sixties who goes down south to investigate three racially related murders. There are also numerous other movies, most of which were ac quired recently. New ones are arriv ing constantly, so keep an eye open. Hey, it beats paying $2.50 to rent a movie."

Lady Bison head to Championships,
Softball enters this weekend's Patriot League tournament as the number two seed with a 25-TO- i record,"By Todd Bianchine Staff Writer The women's softball team will meet Lehigh University tonight at 7:00 p.m. at Patriot's Park in Allentown, PA for a first round match in the Patriot League Softball Championships. The winner of the game will go on to play the winner of the Fordham- Colgate match, but the loser is not out be cause the tournament has a double elimina tion format Bucknell goes into the touma- << !!!L * p"

""Patriot's Park is just a great place to play,"" said Coach Dale Franquet. ""The fans down there are just tremendous and they really appreciate the game of softball. If we win the tourna ment we have a pretty good shot at getting an invitation to the ECAC tournament, which includes the top 14 teams in the North east."" On Tuesday Bucknell sharpened up its skills for this weekend with a sweep of an old ECC foe, Towson State. Sha- #H 9 ron Nichols '91 pitched a three-hit shutout in her final home game as a Lady Bison and Karen Smolskis '91 drove in both runs with two sacrifice flies as Bucknell went on to win 2-0. The win boosted Nichols' record to 14-4 on the year with a total of six shutouts. In the second game, Lisa Fink '93 overcame control problems and the Lady Bison overcame an early three-run lead to beat the Tigers 4-3. Smolskis came up big for Bucknell again as she drove in two runs on two hits along with a sacrifice fly. Mollie Laubach '94 and Fink each had two hits as well. Last weekend Bucknell travelled to Hamilton, NY to take on the Red Raiders from Colgate in a battle which would deter mine second place. In the first game, Fink belted her eighth career home run to set a new school record. The shot,which drove in Jen Yuengling '93, gave Nichols all the in surance she needed as Bucknell went on to grab a 6-3 victory.

Nichols came on to relieve Fink in the second with Bucknell down 2-1, but the Lady Bison were unable to get the bats going and left seven runners on base. Smolskis was the one exception, pounding out two hits and stealing two bases. ""I think that [leaving runners on base] is our biggest problem right now,"" said Franquet ""We've been having trouble get ting the right hit at the right time and conse quently we're stranding a lot of runners. Our team has been working hard, Lisa [Fink] threw a good game against Towson, and Sharon [Nichols] has seen some more in nings to build up her stamina for the tourna ment"" Bucknell graduates three seniors from the team, tri-captains Jen Kalochie, Smolskis, and Nichols. The three have led Bucknell to a current four-year record of 87- 50-1 with the record 25 victories this season. Kalochie has started at second base all four years of her career and is currently hit ting .319. However, she has been more noted for her fine play in the field as well as her inspiration and leadership of the squad. Smolskis leaves Bucknell with a record 128 games played and has started 126 of them. She is currently ranked among Division I leaders in home runs and RBI's and is batting a respectable .317. She has also been recognized for her great speed and range in the outfield. Nichols holds all but one of Bucknell's pitching records. She has pitched four career no-hitters and has struck out 316 batters in her four years. Nichols has posted a 48-25 lifetime record so far and is currently sixth among Division I leaders with a 0.30 ERA. By Chris Drowne Staff Writer It's been five months since Christy Mathewson Memorial Sta dium has expected a crowd for a ra dio-broadcasted sporting event. This weekend that drought will come to an end as Bucknell will host the inaugural Patriot League Outdoor Track and Field Champi onships. ""Being home certainly has it's advantages,"" said distance run ner Norbert Berenyi '91 .The Bison might need those advantages if they are going to duplicate their strong showing at the indoor champion ships this past February. Injuries have decimated the heavily-favored Bucknell men, who won the indoor title by 88 points, turning them into strong contenders. Fordham, second place finishers at indoors, will most likely be ""look ing to do anything to win,"" accord ing to Bucknell Head Coach Art Gulden. The Lady Bison will find themselves battling it out with the same two schools that they faced at indoors. Lafayette is the favorite, with Bucknell and indoor champ Fordham. The championships open with the pole vault and the men's and women's high jumps this after noon. Jeff Schild '92, who won the indoor title while Joe LaBarge '93 and Brett Karcher '93 scored also in the pole vault, finished second (at last Saturday's Millersville Metrics) and Karcher fourth. In the men's high jump, Blaine Fawcett '93 tied for fourth on Bucknell's all-time list with his jump of 6'6"" at Millersville. Fresh man Dawn Ellery's second all-time best Bucknell performance at Millersville shows promise for points. Tomorrow the champion ships will be in full stride, with all the running events and the conclu sion of the field events. Bob Behler, the voice of Bucknell football and basketball, will broadcast four hours of events, interviews and highlights on WVBU 90.5.""This broadcast will give fans much greater insight into what's happen ing in front of them,"" said Behler. ""The idea is that fans at the meet can bring a portable radio or walkman and hear interviews, race calls and other features that other wise would not be available to them. 1 don't think anything of this magnitude has been tried before, and we're excited about this ven ture."" The weight events should prove profitable for the men and detrimental for the women. Paul Austin '91 dominated these events during the winter and should do the same tomorrow. Austin qualified for the IC4A in the discus with a throw of 46.7 meters at Penn Relays last weekend. The women, on the other hand, have not scored a single point in any of the weight events this spring. The sprints and hurdles have been strong point-scorers for both the men and women all year. How ever, the absence of injured Jean Simon '94 and Mark Barolo '93 will open the door for other teams. Karen Shimomura '91, who won the gold medal in the indoor hurdles, and Lynnette McBride '91 should finish their careers on high notes. The distance contingent is where the Bison men will turn for important points. Berenyi, Matt Deardorff '92, Jason Cahilly '92, and Bob Kelly '92 have been con sistent scorers both indoors and out. Tom Wuchenich '92 should finish among the leaders in the steeple chase. Gina Abraham '93, Krisitin Opdyke, '93, and Kelly Marsh '91 will need to run well and score for the Lady Bison. Marsh qualified for the ECAC Championships last weekend at the Penn Relays' 10,000-meter run. The Penn Relays also show cased some excellent relay results. The men's 4 x 100-meter qualified for the IC4A's while the women's 4 x 400-meter and 4 x 800-meter teams established fifth and fourth place on their respective Bucknell all-time performance charts. When asked to evaluate his team's chance, Berenyi said, ""We'll have to do well to win. I think we're as peaked and ready as wp . were for indoors.""__________ J"
Lax strives to capture 2nd place,"By Jamie Diaferia Staff Writer The Bison men's lacrosse team split a pair of games this week when it travelled to Delaware and Colgate. The team, with only two games left, hopes to finish the sea son with a winning record. On Saturday Bucknell took on Colgate in scenic Hamilton, New York. Unfortunately for Colgate, its lacrosse skills do not match the beautiful scenery, as it succumbed to the Bison offensive, 17-9. The game began for Bucknell in a way that has lately become typical for the team. At halftime, the score was 6-5 in favor of the heavy underdogs, Colgate. After the sec ond half began, however, the Bison onslaught began. Led by Garrett Schwartz '93, the team did a 360-degree turn around and took control of the ball. Schwartz scored four for Bucknell, while Doug DePietro '92 added three of his own. Matt Pearce '91, Kevin Roth '92, and Erik Herrema '93 all scored two goals as well in the effort. Colin Barker '94 started the game and allowed six goals on 12 shots while Matt Wojnovich '94 blocked two of five shots. Overall, Head coach Sid Jamieson was pleased with the team's play, noting that it did an excellent job getting back into the game after being down at the half. He said, ""Colgate was a scrappy little team. They really made a contest out of it when we weren't exactly executing the things we should have been executing."" He added, ""We took a little longer to get going. In the second half we took over and suddenly it was no longer a contest."" Responding to the suggestion that the team's lackluster first-half play may simply be a result of the long schedule this season, Jamieson replied, ""We have to work hard to play well. We need to outhustle. At Colgate we needed to get our our legs under us and get a second wind."" Jamieson acknowledged the work of Todd Streelman '92 who also had five assists to lead the Bi son attack. He said, ""He is definitely a strong player physically. He plays"

Streelman had four goals and seven assists in the two games this week. The Bison headed to Dela ware on Wednesday where they suffered a heartbreaking defeat, 12- 11. The Bison went into the game hoping to get off to a fast start and did just that jumping out to an early lead. Jamieson said, ""We played ag gressively and ran off to a 4-0 lead. We made critical errors in the fourth quarter. We didn't win our face-offs and we got impatient with ball con trol."" He added, ""We failed to score with a man down at a time when we could have stretched our lead. At the end we simply could not execute."" Streelman was the high scorer with four goals, while DePietro had three and Justin Zackey '94 had two. The offense once again kept the Bison in the game. Although the offense ap peared to be a weak spot earlier this year, several key players have taken over the offensive reins and carried the team. One of the big surprises of the day was the play of Wojnovich. Relegated to the job of second string goalie at the beginning of the season, the freshman has been given the starting nod from Jamieson after Barker's dismissal from the team. Wojnovich responded by blocking 21 of 33 shots in the game against a hard-shooting Delaware squad. As Jamieson said, ""He played super. He was absolutely outstanding."" The Bison host Lafayette tomorrow. With only two games re maining, Jamieson is confident the team will finish with a winning record. He stated, ""Saturday night is huge. We need to win to finish in second place in the Patriot League and to get the points."" He added, ""We need to finish our work in the Patriot League to prove we are as good as I think we are. We have a great team and the kids are coming along well. Good things are going on with this program."" Monday the Lax team travels to Scranton to con clude their season. r"

Athletes reflect on major injuries,
(Athlete of the Week],"(Left to Right) Bruno Barbera '94, Cris Stenstrom '94, Jerome Charlier '92, Head Coach Craig Reynolds, Andrew Cantor '92, Captain Scott Bank '91, Chris Rimpel '93, and Greg Downing '94"
1991 MEN'S TENNIS TEAM,"The 1991 men's tennis team is selected Athletes of the Week for winning the Patriot League Championship this past weekend at Colgate University. The Bison captured two of the individual titles outright and ammassed numerous other point earning performances. Army came into the tournament heavily favored and the top seed in every category except second doubles. Bucknell was expected to finish no better than third or fourth in the championships. By Melissa Skelton Injuring a knee can be a pain ful experience for the average per son, but for an athlete, the effects are devastating, often life-altering. Knee injuries, unlike ankle sprains or chronic injuries, require more than just a tape job to put an athlete back on the playing field. For four Bucknell athletes, such injuries meant re-evaluating their futures here. Men's basketball recruit Chris Simpson '94 suffered a bone chip fracture while playing in a high school alumni basketball game in Virginia. Had the damage to Simpson's knee been permanent, he might not have continued at Buck nell. ""I might have transferred from this school. Basketball is a big part of my life... things would be so dif ferent I just might have transferred at the end of the year to one of the other schools that accepted me."" Simpson's reaction may seem severe, but Kelly Kempton '93, a women's varsity basketball player, echoed Simpson's willingness to re structure his college careen ""Part of my dream was to just go to a Divi sion I school and play, because I love the sport. And I thought 'There is no way I can stay here and not play basketball.'"" Kempton had begun noticing a gnawing ache in her knee during pre-season, and as. the playing sea son started, the pain intensified. ""In about October, I could tell that it was affecting my play. Even Mark [Keppler] the trainer said it. 'Kelly, you can't play, you can't run up and do.W9. ' and l .s a i d ^ a ^ f C : ally.* So that s when they all [Keppler, assistant trainer Julie Au gustine, and or thopedic surgeons Gale Reish and John Magill] did the tests and said, 'Kelly, we think you have torn cartilege.'"" ""They said it would take 4-6 weeks or 6-8 weeks [for rehab] depending on the injury. In the back of my mind, I was thinking, ""'My knee's never go ing to be the same. Am I really going to be able to get back on the court after this?""' Because Kempton was able to return to the game after four weeks of rehabilitation, she did not have to sacrifice an entire season. However, this was Kempton's second injury since coming to Bucknell, and the last one caused her to miss most of her freshman season. Speaking of the first injury, Kempton said, ""Actually, it wasn't as bad. I didn'.t think I was going to get much playing time anyway, and I didn't mind it so much because I knew I had three more years. Also, I knew I could get red-shirted, and I could have that fourth year, so tech nically I could still have my four years of college playing that I wanted. This year's was much more pressure. The dream of playing four years has been cut down to three."" The idea of red-shirting is a popular one in college athletics. NCAA athletes have the opportunity to sit out one season in order to maintain four years of eligibility. This allows serious athletes with in juries or 5 year academic programs to best utilize their playing time. Julie Bachman GR, 1990-91 women's basketball co-captain was able to play as a red-shirt for Buck nell this year because of an injury during her undergraduate years. Similarity, had the injury Jeff Kelly '92 sustained occurred at any other time and caused him to miss a sea son, he would also have opted for the red-shirt The Bison quarterback's dedi cation to sports is evident ""I love playing the game, and I've got five years to play four, so I can take that extra year and use up my eligibility, and I'm sure I'd want to do it some where. Definitely. I'm an athlete. I've been an athlete since I was eight years old. It's something in me; I have to play, I have to do this. I tore my knee playing intramural basket ball. I'm always doing something."" An injury, such as the one to Kelly's knee, is one from which many athletes do not fully recover. He suffered a tom anterior cruciate ligament, the primary ligament holding the knee joint together. Usually, when an athlete tears the ligament as seriously as Kelly did, returning to a varsity sport is un likely. He was fortunate that a pro cedure called an allograft, a tissue transplant from an organ donor, was a surgical option. Jeff Kelly was aware of this from the beginning. ""You sit there and think, 'what if I actually did hurt myself?' As an athlete, you always hear about knee injuries. You think, 'Oh no, a knee injury!' That's like death to an ath lete. I tried to be optimistic and say, 'No, that's not what it is,' but in the back of your mind, it could be. If it is a knee injury, that's a bad thing as far as athletes go."" When he heard about the ex tent of the damage to his knee, Kelly was devastated. ""The guy told me I had a tom ACL, and that was just a major blow. I had told my parents not to even bother to come for the surgery... but if they hadn't been there that day, hell would have just broken loose, because I was just so broken up."" Kelly's injury was well-timed. He was playing basketball just be fore Thanksgiving break, after the football season ended. With consul tations, surgery and rehabilitation time, Kelly will just make it back in time for the 1991 season. ""Each day, that day that I'll be back gets pushed closer to now. The original date was August 1, but my progress has just been great."" Not many athletes with Kelly's injury are as lucky. Julie McCausland '91 has been playing field hockey and lacrosse every year since her freshman year of high school. In order to determine whether her knee was in good enough condition to play lacrosse this spring, McCausland had to pass a series of ""pivot shift"" tests to test the flexibility and strength of her knee in playing situations. When her knee gave out during the final test, she broke down. ""I really just cried. This was my last test; if I passed this test, I was going to be playing."" This year's injury is not a new one for McCausland. The original trauma to her knee occurred during her senior year of high school. Sev eral surgeries and years of rehabili tation later, McCausland again had to sit out a season. Having reinjured her knee this past summer and dis covering that a staple from the origi nal surgery had come loose and lodged itself in her joint, McCausland's pain, physical and mental, resurfaced. ""I thought, 'Oh no, not again. I don't know if I can stand this.' I had to rehab all over again, and that was bad enough."" McCausland's decision not to play was exactly that a conscious choice. Knowing that with her par ticular situation, further damage could be permanent and life-threat ening, she chose not to take the risk. ""I just can't take the chance, and I knew it, I knew that was the answer. And that's why when my knee pivot shifted out, even though the staple wasn't a factor yet, I decided no, I can't play, because I never ever want to have another reconstruction. Talk to anybody on this campus; recon structions are just hell."" The doctor informed her that once her knee reached a point of less than IS percent deficiency in range of motion, she could play. Her re sponse was, ""Buddy, I am not play ing."" She explained, ""I never went back when they said it would really endanger me. Once it really oc curred to me that, 'Julie, you may have to get another reconstruction and you may lose...' I could never imagine losing a leg or having a per manent limp. Never. I would never ever want that. Lacrosse does not mean that much."" Not that she doesn't take her athletics seriously. Of her future in sports, McCausland says, ""My spring semester has always been la crosse; I don't know what I would do without it. Now I have to be a different type of athlete; I want to get into biking... walking; running's really going to be out because right now it just hurts too much. Mark [Keppler] said to me, 'This doesn't mean you're no longer an athlete, this means you have become another type of athlete.'"" McCausland serves as the team manager so she can remain an active member of the team. ""I've loved all the experiences I've had. I still go to practice every day."" Al though she cannot imagine life with out lacrosse, she does not believe she would have altered her college plans to red-shirt had her injury occurred earlier in her career. ""No, it doesn't mean that much to me. I have a schedule for life... I probably would have done the same thing I am now [managing]. No, I wouldn't have stayed on."" Asked what it is then that makes an injury so difficult to handle, she explained, ""Because you define yourself that way; that is me. I'm Julie, the lacrosse player. I'm also Julie, the Alpha Chi, and I used to be Julie, the Sem Gem, and Julie, the bio major, but I'm also Julie, the lacrosse player, and 1 take a lot of pride in that I like that, I like that part of me."" For the younger players, the issue of playing is more pressing. For both Simpson and Kempton, it was dfficult to sit and watch other young players move up the ranks. Simpson said, ""I would watch Raymond [Brown '94] get some playing time, and although I was glad he was doing well, I kept think ing, 'that could be me,' and it made me work even harder."" Kempton pointed out how hard it was to sit and watch practice while she was rehabilitating. ""You want to do it so bad, but you can't. You can't play. It's amazing that you can't play."" When she returned, she noted how different her skills were at first ""I was very frustrated when I got back on the court. I didn't play very well... my shots weren't going in, I wasn't playing, and I was getting so frustrated. I was backtracking to seventh and eighth grade for fundamentals."" For Simpson, it also put the greater picture into perspective. ""I only had three more years. The chances of playing beyond college are little or none. I realized that in my four years here, I was more com mitted to do my best in anything I aspired to do."" Kelly feels an inherent com pulsion to play, difficult to sup press even for a serious injury. ""It's just the competitive na ture of it. Ath letes have grown up doing these same things all their life; playing football, basket ball, baseball, any sport, and"
I,"played all three in high school, until I got here. That's just something that's in me, that I feel I have to do because of my competitive na ture, my competi tive spirit. When you hear that somebody can take that much of your life away from you, or something did, or could, it seems like you're miss ing a piece of you."" And how will the future shape up for these athletes? Simpson: ""I threw myself into rehab. Every moment I wasn't eat ing or sleeping I was in the training room doing something or other."" He was able to return to the court before the season finished, and promises to be in the running for a starting posi tion next fall. Kempton: ""When it first hap pened, I thought, 'Oh my god, sur gery. They're taking my knee, they're going into my knee.' Com pared to some of the other surgeries I saw though, I thought, 'Well, maybe I'm kind of lucky.' She also returned before the end of the '91 season, and with two full years ahead, barring further injury, will be a top contend<<'. Kelly: ""I'm sure the first time I go out there and I run around and start cutting, I'm going to be wary of it just to see how it works. Somebody's going to hit me the first time, and I'm proobably going to get up and shake it off, and then maybe I can get back into it. But I'm sure I have to climb that hill and get to that point where I can say, 'Yeah, I'm confident in my knee enough to be confident in myself enough where I can perform to what I expect myself to do.'"" ""Everybody's been so great. My parents were great; without your family members, you'd have a very hard time getting through it... my brother too. The good Lord, he works miracles all the time. I'm sure he's working his stuff on me. It al most seems that things are going so well, almost too well. I don't mind it one bit, but I guess I'm still leery: 'Be careful, don't be stupid, don't jeopardize what you've worked so hard to get to, to get back to.' It's a struggle, and I've got a lot of help, so I'm going to make it."" With the graduation of Todd Hatajik '91 this year, Kelly is likely to be the next starting quarterback for the Bison. McCausland: ""[What stands out is] the fact that it made me a bet ter person in a lot of ways. It made me look outside of myself as well to From page 16 who scored four goals. She is tied for the lead in goals scored this season with Jen Kehoe '94, with 24. Kehoe contributed two goals against UMBC. Jennifer Hayes '93, Tricia Way '94, Leslie Why '92, and Sue Wells '93 each added one. Defen sively, Kahra Foster '92 played well, making several one-on-one saves. This contest followed a game at home versus Slippery Rock Uni versity. Again the offense was paced by Ellwood and Kehoe as they scored four and three goals respec tively in the Bison's 15-11 victory. But the true tale of the game was Bucknell's domination at midfield, where Alison Arth '93, Way, and Sue Signori '93 combined for five goals. Arth tallied two and joined the defense with an aggressive and confident style of play. Why and Julie Goeller '91 also added offensive spark with two goals apiece. Averill was very pleased with the victory. ""The team kept their in tensity and it payed off during this other people. I could have just whined and cried, and I think I've always really taken it with a mature attitude and really worked hard. I'm very proud of that fact, that I've come back. Its a healthy way to live, being in shape, so I need to do it anyway."" ""There's always a 'why me?' I don't ask that very much though. Why ask it?"" McCausland's lacrosse career may have reached its end, but the spirit of the sport will continue in her and the other athletes endlessly, and no physical injury can stand in the way. game. It was a great win for Buck nell."" The women began their week as they traveled to Drexel in an in tensive matchup. Bucknell battled strong early, but a ten minute lapse in the first half left the team down 9- 3 at halftime. The Bison did, how ever, come alive in the second half, outscoring Drexel 4-3. But, their lapse in the first half had left them with an insurmountable gap to overcome and they fell 12-7 in the contest. Seven different Bison each scored once in the defeat Averill gave Drexel a lot of credit for their level of play and hustle on the field, but commented, ""Our youth and inexperience were two factors that set us back in this game. Little things like turnovers and dropped balls were some of our weaknesses."" This Saturday the womens' lacrosse team concludes its season as they host Cornell at 1 p.m. The Bison will be trying to avenge a 14-5 loss to the Big Red which they suffered last season. Mike Klemen/The Bucknellian Sue Signori '94 dominated the midfield during Bucknell's 15-11 vic tory over Slippery Rock last Sunday afternoon. The Lady Bison con clude their season at home tomorrow against Cornell University. Peter Ho/The Bucknellian Jeff Kelly '92, seen here against Hofstra in a game earlier this season, is one of many collegiate athletes whose careers have been affected by a serious injury. Kelly suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament, but fortunately may have the opportunity to lead the Bison at the quarterback position in upcoming seasons."

Bucknellians aid local Little League,"By Mitch Benton Staff Writer It is a natural combination, Bucknell University and the Lewis- burg Township Little League. A great deal of the Little League's ad ministration and coaching personnel are associated with the school, either as a member of the faculty or student body. These participants see the Little League as an opportunity to return favors to a tradition that helped them to grow as athletes and people. Ray Randel, coach of the Pennsylvania House squad and as sistant director of financial aid, claims that he is trying to give to his son what his father gave to him. ""When I was young, about nine or ten years old, there was no Little League in my town and my father and a group of other fathers started an 11-12 year old league of orga nized baseball. After I graduated from that league, he started a Babe Ruth League [for high school stu dents]."" The children begin their Little League careers with a T-ball league for six to eight year olds. In this league the youngsters, both girls and boys, get a feel for the game hitting the ball off of a set tee, with the pitcher acting only as another fielder. After outgrowing this league, they move on to the minor league, for nine to twelve year olds; the girls play softball, and the boys playing baseball. Overlapping the minor league is the major league, which takes its players from the best of the minor leaguers. After the players turn thirteen, they can join the Senior League, for ( which they can play until they sixteen. A usual season consists of at least twelve games, normally up to fourteen; most begin in early April. Many of the Senior League play ers also play on the high school team and they must wait until after that season ends. Pete Bergonia, a 22-year veteran of the Bucknell staff and cur rent physical plant employee, has been the Little League President for three years. Discussing the league's relationship with Bucknell, he said, ""The relationship is natural. Along with the first-hand help that Buck nell faculty and students are giving, there is also a great deal of other types of support. ""I know a number of fraterni ties sponsor teams financially as well as in other ways. Their mem bers come out and help teach and umpire and just cheer for their teams. I know that when they come out and root for the kids, it gives a tremen dous boost to the players."" The three fraternities that sponsor teams are Phi Gamma Delta, Lambda Chi Al pha, and Sigma Phi Epsilon. Chris Drowne '93 con tinues his life-long associa tion with the Little League by coaching the West Milton State Bank squad, affection ately known as the Lewisburg Orioles. Drowne in herited his team from Kyle Rude '90, for whom he as sisted last season. Jon Terry '93 and Kirk Peters '93 work hard as valuable assistants. Matt Deardorff '92, who runs for Bucknell's cross country and track teams, will join the staff at the end of the school year. For Drowne, this is the ninth team that he has coached since he began when he was sixteen. He be lieves that his only problem with be ing coach is that the umpires do not give him enough respect When asked about his rival coach, Randel says that ""Chris runs Little aque Baseball an outstanding program and he isn't looked down upon at all by the other coaches in the league. He is well re spected."" Drowne has already planned to take the first few weeks off of his summer employment so that he can continue to coach the team through the season's comple tion. While Bergonia says the league's purpose is the teaching and excitement that its participants ex perience, he is obviously also ex cited by its success. ""Last summer, for the first time, our major league all-star team won the District 13 Championship and went on to play in the Sectionals against Shippensburg."" Had the Lewisburg won that game the team would have played another for the right to attend the Little League World Series, held every year in Williamsport. For Bergonia, the participation is a family matter. While his daughters help by coaching, his wife runs the auxiliary functions. ""I love participating with my family in this league, the only downfall is that many summer nights end in dinner around the hot dog stand."" These Bucknellians certaintly receive at least as much from their participation as they give. These dedicated volunteers include"
Crew sweeps at LaSalle Invitational,"By Kyle Betz Staff Writer Last weekend Bucknell hosted the Annual Bucknell Invitational Regatta, which resulted in a virtual mint of Bucknell medals. On that picture perfect day, there were five Bucknell golds, three Bucknell sec ond place finishes and even a token last place for a spirited Bucknell alumni men's varsity eight. In the serious races, the Bison men's Varsity Four took second with a time of 7:36.48 behind a fast and experienced Loyola crew that fin ished in 7:35.00. The Bucknell women's varsity eight took gold with a time of 8:33.00, beating West Virginia and Scranton. The Bison men's varsity eight finished second behind Franklin & Marshall, in a too-close-to-call finish. .72 seconds"
Baseball,"From page 1 was played on Saturday, but the Bi son did not in any way rest. They pounded out 16 runs on 20 hits, and were led by--wait, take a guess-- Koemer and Ahrens. The latter went three for three with a homer and five RBI, while Koemer chipped in four hits, including a double and his team-high eighth triple of the year. Mike Kearns '93 (3-5, 2 RBI, 2 runs), Gyimesi (2 hits, 2 RBI, 2 runs), and Larry Trout '93 (3 hits, 2 RBI, 2 runs) also played well. Pitcher Denis Maguire '93(1-2) was able to withstand Colgate's eight- run, 14-hit attack for eight innings before letting Brian Hildick '93 fin ish up. On Tuesday, Mt. St. Mary's came to town and probably figured that ten runs and 15 hits would be enough to beat the Bison. Not this week, though. Ahrens' three hit, three RBI afternoon helped Bucknell win 12-10. After erasing a 7-3 defi cit with a four-run sixth inning, the Bison again found themselves train- separated the finishes of those two crews. The Bison men's lightweight varsity four took gold in a time of 8:41.00 beating the next closest boat, WVU, by eight seconds. The Lady Bison women's varsity four took gold with a time of 8:58.00. In Novice action, the Bucknell women's eight took second in the only race of the day with two heats. They finished nine seconds behind the Franklin and Marshall boat that finished in 7:30.00. The Bucknell men's heavyweight eight raced in the same heat as their own light weight eight. The two Bison crews dominated the race and the heavies finished in 7:24.50 ahead of the lights who pulled a 7:29.93. To catch us up to date, The Bucknell University crew team trav elled to New Jersey April 20th for the LaSalle Invitational Regatta on the Cooper River. On that cold rainy morning the Bison launched from the dock with anxious and tense strokes, preparing for an important race. In the race, which consisted of a preliminary heat, semis, and finals for each category, four Bucknell boats advanced to the finals. The men's varsity four took second in the final, nipping at the heals of a LaSalle boat that they had already beaten in the semis. In that boat Kim Dobies '91 coxed Dave Rhodes '92, Doug Lebda '92, Tripp Dixon '91, and bowman Kyle Betz '92. Dobies was not disappointed in her crew and she said, ""We rowed a tough race and it just shows us that the level of our competition should not be underestimated -- they'll see us at Dad Vails, that's for sure."" There were 17 schools in their ing in the eighth 10-8. That inevi table rally came in the bottom of that frame as the 1991 edition of Murder's Row batted around, sew ing four runs. Koemer (1-0) put away the lumber for a few innings, pitching the last two innings in no hit fashion, striking out four, to notch the win. On Wednesday the Bison travelled out Route 80 to play Bloomsburg, and the result was an impressive 15-0 thrashing. Let's start with the pitching for a change. After all, even if Bucknell only managed one run, they still would have won. Jack Kazanjian '93 (5-2) started and pitched seven shutout innings, striking out eight while only giving up four hits. Rich Heller '94 finished up with two perfect innings, striking out three more. Offensively, there were plenty of crooked numbers to go around in the Bucknell boxscore. The two, three, and four hitters in the lineup (Koerner, Kennedy, and Ahrens) combined to go nine for 14 with six home runs (2 apiece), 12 RBI, and nine mns scored. Matt Sinegocki '93 drove in the other three runs with his first homer of the year, and Jeff Karnes '92 went two for two and scored twice. In all, the offense battered six Bloomsburg hurlers for 15 runs and 17 hits (11 of them for extra bases, including a club record seven homers). The Bison played their sixth game of the week yesterday at home against Pittsburgh, winning 5-2. Freshman pitcher Jim Stevens (3-0) won his second consecutive start. Stevens went the distance, allowing just two unearned mns on six hits. Ahrens got things started in the bot tom of the second with a solo homer, his seventh of the year and third in the last two days. After Pitt tallied its two unearned runs in the fourth, Kennedy retied it with a sacrifice fly in the bottom of the inning. The Bi son went in front for good in the fifth when Mike Kearns '93 plated a triple past Larry Trout Run-scoring singles by Ted Obligado '91 and Jim Zervanos '92 in the sixth capped off the scoring. ,,a . ...... m m m sa.

REE GAS,
Arm s PUMP,"Bucknell's record now stands at 23-11-1,8-4 in the Patriot League. The Bison hurlers have surprised many people over the course of the year. Jim Stevens '94 has shown much promise late in the year. He attributes the development of his curveball and other off-speed pitches to much of his success. He is now 3- 0 with a 1.19 ERA, and is holding opponents to a paltry .212 batting average. In general, Stevens credits Bucknell's late season surge to team unity. ""Once we got our momentum going, there was a snowball effect. One guy got hot, then the rest of the team just picked up,"" said the fresh man righthander from Carrolltown,"
PA.,"Koerner has been another key member. In addition to his torrid bat, Koerner has a 1.40 ERA in nine games on the mound. He has picked up a win and three saves while holding opposing batters to a .169 batting average. Koemer feels that the warm weather has everyone feeling good right now. ""Up and down our lineup everyone is hot,"" said Koemer. ""There is no weak link--there is no time for the pitcher to relax."" Hopefully, everyone will re main hot for one more weekend. Bucknell will travel to Lafayette for a three-game series in Easton. Fordham (12-3) wrapped up the Pa triot League title with a 12-inning win over Holy Cross. Holy Cross finished the season at 11-4, so a sweep of Lafayette would be neces sary to gain a share of second place in the conference for Bucknell. Lafayette is led offensively by Mark Rowland and Brian Shevitz, who leads the league with eight home runs. Rob Hatalovsky and Bob Pogyor are their best pitchers, and are likely to face the Bison this weekend. Ever wonder where you're losing those extra miles per gallon your dealer promised you? The fact is, Americans lose over tw o million gallons of gas every day to low tire pressure. Have you checked yours lately? President Bush thanks you for helping."

Tennis takes Patriot League crown,"Courtesy of Bucknell Tennis Team Andrew Cantor '92 warms up for his third singles match. Cantor won the Patriot League title at that position. By Mike Markovich Staff Writer In what was one of the biggest surprises in recent Bucknell sports history, the men's tennis team over came tremendous odds and defeated a heavily favored Army squad to take the overall team trophy at the inaugural Patriot League Champi onship last weekend. The Bison finished their matches with a team total of 30 points, enough to fend off Army and Colgate, who tied for second with 26 points each. The rest of the teams were basically along for the ride, with Fordham finishing fourth with 15 points, Lehigh fifth with 13, Lafayette sixth with 10, and Holy Cross bringing up the rear with 2.5 total points. All the individual titles were split between the top three overall finishers, with the highlights of Bucknell's victory coming in the forms of a number three singles championship for Andrew Cantor '92 and the number three doubles crown going to Cris StenstrOm '94 and partner Scott Bank '91. From the outset, Coach Craig Reynolds felt that, if the team played a ""very good"" tournament, they would finish second at best. Fol lowing Friday night's seeding meeting, which set Army as the top seed in all but the number two doubles bracket, Reynolds felt that ""no coach in the room would've picked anyone but Army to win that tournament."" But, due to the way the scoring was set up, all those top seeds turned out to be somewhat of a detriment for the feared Army squad. Each match won during the tournament brought its team two points. Since Army had byes in the first round of every bracket for which it held the top seed, which included all six singles flights, eight of their nine first matches became worth four points for a victory, and nothing if they lost. As Reynolds points out, ""The first match you play in a tournament is often your most difficult, and this hurt Army badly as they lost three out of their first six singles matches, each of those representing a four point turnaround for them."" Those three defeats came at numbers three, four, and five singles, with the number four defeat of Army's top- seeded Ivan Brown coming at the hands of Bucknell's Stenstrbm. Reynolds called this 6-2, 6-1 match ""one of the biggest upsets of the tournament. Cris played very smart and very well, and this semifinal match was an example of a four point turnaround from Army directly to us."" Another such match involved StenstrOm: the number three doubles semifinal, in which he and Bank de feated Army's top-seeded duo of Whalen and Schaaf 6-4,2-6, 7-6 (8- 6). What the final score doesn't show is that Bank and Stenstrbm were down 5-2 and three service breaks in the third set, only to save four match points, force the tiebreaker, and win it fra1 the victory and another four points snatched from Army. The hot duo then downed Lafayette's Manger and Swamy 6-3, 6-0 in the final to take the number three title home. Bank was understandably elated, especially about the semifi nal match. ""That was one of the most exciting matches I've ever been in volved in, and probably the best of the tournament. As captain and the only senior on the team, winning an individual title was a great way to finish my Bucknell career. And with only myself graduating this year, Bucknell should have a good chance to be successful next year as well. I was just glad to be around to be a part of Bucknell's first Patriot League Championship."" Stenstrdm was equally as ex cited, saying, ""I was extremely happy to be able to grant Scott this Patriot League doubles victory in his last year on the team."" He continued, ""It is a great feeling to win, but vic tory is particularly sweet when coming unexpectedly. None of us thought that we would stand a chance at winning when we arrived at Colgate on Friday. However, the team really pulied through with ev eryone playing well. ""Emotional support from the team played a vital role in each and every match, especially that which came from Greg 'Father' Downing ['94], who let his voice be heard af ter nearly every point. We should be proud of our achievement, but a lot of work needs to be done in order for us to be a contender once again next year."" Friday saw the Bison warming up for the championships with a shortened-format dual match versus tournament host Colgate. This match, in which the singles contests were ten-game pro sets and doubles decided in eight game pro sets, proved to be a surprisingly lopsided 6-3 Bison victory, most notably with a 5-1 Bison singles margin, and thus a large confidence builder for the weekend. Reynolds didn't expect the five singles victories he got, and called the match ""a real shot in the arm for the team. It gave us the con fidence we needed to perform the way we did over the weekend."" And perform they did. Cantor pointed out, ""After a rocky first half of the season, the team rose to the occasion last weekend. Every mem ber on the team had excellent indi vidual performances. Tenacity was in the hands and feet of every team member, and this extreme devotion earned us the title."" Indeed, Reynolds was hard pressed to choose one match as decisive or in dicative of the tournament, noting that ""even the weaker teams like Fordham or Holy Cross have some excellent individual players. And one of the things that really helped our cause, in addition to our play, was the fact some of these players upset favored Army players in early rounds."" He mainly wants to emphasize that the victory was truly a team ef fort. The four-point margin of vic tory over runners-up Army and Colgate reflects only one of the four point turnarounds of which Bucknell had so many during the weekend. Losing any one of those matches would have put Army right in the thick of things with the Bison. Reynolds says, ""Most of all. I'm just delighted for the players. To have won the final ECC Championship last year and come back this year to prove themselves again as the first Patriot League champs really speaks volumes about this team. They've got so much to be proud of, and I couldn't be happier for them."" Courtesy of Bucknell Tennis Team Cris Stenstrom '94 prepares for the championship match at the third doubles position. Stenstrom and his partner, captain Scott Bank '91, won the Patriot League title last weekend at Colgate University."
Victoria Gorman '93 leads the,
women's water polo to nationals,"By Andrea Falcione If waking up at 5:30 a.m. to drive 20 minutes for two hours of vigorous exercise is not your idea of a fun way to spend a summer morn ing, then you may not envy Victoria Gorman '93. However, if you have ever had dreams of being an Olym pic athlete, then you may change your mind. Gorman is Bucknell's leading female water polo player, and her Olympic dreams are just barely beyond her reach. Beyond her reach for the sole reason that women's water polo, unlike its male counterpart, has yet to be recognized as an Olympic sport Gorman, only a sophomore at Bucknell, started playing water polo at the age of 14, when her Naval Academy Junior Swim Club coach decided to establish a junior water polo team. According to Gorman, she ""just naturally took to the game"" and immediately began to excel. After only a year and a half of experience with the game, she tried out and was chosen to train at the Olympic Training Center in Colo rado. That same year her club team competed in Junior Olympics for the first time, where they did not fare well. However, she and her team returned the following year to cap ture first place, beating even the far more experienced West Coast teams. Despite her passion and talent for water polo, Gorman did not limit her athletic abilities to polo; she was also a four-time varsity letter winner in swimming and a two-time varsity letter winner in lacrosse during her high school career. The spring of 1989, her senior year in high school, saw Gorman's first national recognition, when she made the Junior National ""B"" team. Upon entering the Bucknell aquatics scene as a freshman, Gorman prac ticed with the men's water polo team in the fall, swam on the women's swim team throughout the winter, and was the key to the Bucknell women's club water polo team dur ing the spring. Her coach, Marla Cautilli, says of Gorman, ""She ab solutely makes our team. What can I say except that she's awesome! I think Vicki has a tremendous future as an international water polo player. She's still young, but give her five years and she'll be a dominant factor on the international scene."" While playing for the Bucknell women's team, she was moved up to the Jun ior National ""A"" team for national competition. The honors were just begin ning for Gorman in 1990, however. Her young club team from Annapo lis, MD traveled to Senior Nationals for the first time that summer, where they finished an impressive eighth of 16 teams. There she was named as a second team All-American. Then, during the Hawaiian Invitational Tournament, she was officially cho sen by the Junior National coach to be a member of the Junior World Championship team, which will compete in an international tourna ment in her hometown of Annapolis during June of 1991. Gorman returned once again to the Bucknell men's water polo team during the fall of 1990, where she has had to become stronger and faster in order to play at the men's level. Of her experience playing with the men's team, Gorman says, ""I feel honored to play with the guys, and I wouldn't be where I am now without having had the opportunity to prac tice with them."" Christmas-time brought more than just gifts under the tree for Gorman. During a try-out trip to California in December, she achieved her greatest accomplish ment in the sport thus far--she was chosen for the Senior National ""A"" team, skipping the Senior ""B"" level altogether. Her position on the Se nior ""A"" team, equivalent to an Olympic squad, will be a learning experience in more than one way, Gorman believes. ""Being a member of the national team is rewarding in many ways. It will allow me to compete on an international level and to travel to foreign countries. It will be a cultural as well as an ath letic experience, '' she says. Being a member of the National ""A"" team has been very demanding for Gorman, as it required her to travel to California three to six weekends at the start of the semester, as well as the week of Spring Break for an Easter training camp. Gorman is not only a premier athlete, however; she may be one of Bucknell's best examples of a scholar-athlete as well. A double major in english and philosophy, she maintains a 3.2 grade point average. She divides her days between class, practice, and studying throughout both semesters and all three athletic seasons. Gorman reasons, ""I've always believed that grades and school are important. Since I've been at Buck nell, I've managed to budget my time effectively so that I can main tain good grades, intensive training, and even find time to have fun with my friends."" The Bucknell team of which Gorman is a member is led by cap tains Elaine Lammey GR and varsity swimmer Carla Banashek '91 as well as their experienced senior class, which consists of five other women. Freshmen varsity swimmers Anne-Marie Nielson and Lisa. Bell also bring previous experience to the team, having played water polo prior to arriving at Bucknell. The team boasts of three other returning play ers and five promising rookies. The women have travelled to Maryland and Slippery Rock for tournaments this spring and have also hosted two Bucknell tournaments. Last weekend, the Bucknell women's polo team hosted the East ern Collegiate Water Polo Tourna ment at Freas-Rooke Pool. Bucknell, Harvard, MIT, Slippery Rock, and the University of Maryland com peted for the Eastern championship title. Bucknell starters for the week end were Banashek, Gorman, Susan Hollinshead '91, Lammey, Kadi Miller '91 Nielson, and Jen Reeb '92. Bell was a back-up player due to illness. Bucknell placed second behind nationally ranked Slippery Rock; the team took games 10-4 against Maryland, 8-6 against Harvard, and 11-3 against MIT. Their only loss came at the hands of Slippery Rock, 16-3. Gorman scored an incredible 20 of Bucknell's 32 goals on the weekend to earn her a spot on the All-Tournament First Team along with teammate Elaine Lammey and co-MVP of the tournament, a title that she shared with Slippery Rock's Leslie Kerfoot. Kerfoot is a National teammate of Gorman's. Other scorers for Bucknell on the weekend were Nielson (4), Banashek (3), Bell (1), Suzanne DiLenge '94 (1), Heather Kelly '91 (1), Miller (1), and Reeb (1). Banashek and Nielson also shared All-Tournament Second Team hon ors. Bucknell's second place finish at Easterns earned the team a spot at Outdoor Collegiate Senior Nationals in San Diego, where it is seeded sixth of U.C. Berkeley and the Uni versity of Michigan. Slippery Rock goes into Nationals seeded third. Cautilli says, ""We wouldn't be go ing to California without Vicki. She's a terrific hole-set [the integral position for team success] and led our team not only in scoring this weekend, but in defensive steals and assists as well."" The Bucknell team is scheduled to leave for California on May 17th."
Lax loses by one,
in last 20 seconds,"By Scott Brown and Eliza Wampler Staff Writers The womens' lacrosse team dropped to 4-12 as it lost to the University of Maryland at Baltimore County, 11-10, in perhaps the most exciting game of the year. Accord ing to Head Coach Jennifer Averill, ""Hollywood couldn't have written a script for the outcome of yesterday's game."" The winning goal was scored on the Bison with only twenty sec- onds remaining in a contest that went back and forth throughout. Bucknell dominated the midfield and attack, but were unable to capitalize as they fell behind by four goals early in the match before battling back to tie the game at half time. Toward the end of the game the Bison lost some of that edge and were unable to keep their lead due to sloppy play and lack of patience. The Bison were led offen sively by Dorie Lynn Elwood '92 see WOMEN'S LAX, page 14 Mike Klemen/The Bucknellian Jennifer Kehoe '94 fights for a loose ball against Slippery Rock last Sunday. Kehoe scored three goals to lead the Lady Bison to victory. >>"
