O’Brien, Smith
give personnel
choice to deans

By DAVID HAWKINGS

University President Dennis
O’Brien has removed himself and
Provost Wendell Smith from ac-
tive participation in personnel
matters as part of a partial
reassigning of responsibility
within the administration.

O’Brien this summer made the
decision to give “‘primary respon-
sibility” for decisionmaking on
matters of appointments, reap-
pointments, tenure, promotion
and salary distribution to the
deans of the College of Arts and
Sciences and Engineering, effec-
tive at the beginning of this
semester.

The additional burden placed
on the office of Arts and Sciences
Dean Robert Chambers has in
part prompted the president to
also name Professor of Chem-
istry Manning Smith to the newly
created post of associate dean of
the college for special projects.

Smith’s primary responsibility,
however, will be to examine ad-
ministrative and faculty struc-
tures as a “means of enhancing
collegiality within the Universi-
ty,” according to a letter sent to
the faculty June 27 by O’Brien.

The appointment of Smith to
the three-year temporary posi-
tion and the shifting of respon-
sibility for personnel decisions
are meant to remove the ‘‘ge-
nuine confusion” and ‘“‘dissatis-
faction” expressed by both the
faculty and the administration—
including the president and
provost—about the division of
power in staff hiring and firing,
O’Brien said.

In the past, questions concern-
ing personnel matters have been
referred to the offices of the
president, the provost, the two
deans, department chairman and
assorted other faculty and staff,
creating a confusion ‘among
almost everybody’’ — according
to O’Brien — as to who acted and
who spoke for the University.

The president said he was not
“backing out” of working on the
often-sensitive areas of tenure
and merit salary increases.

MANNING SMITH

In his letter to the faculty,
O’Brien said he would remain ‘‘a
half-step back from personnel
decisions,” but in an interview
Wednesday he said he ‘cannot
conceive of reversing a decision”
made by the deans.

The provost will remain as dis-
tant from the actions taken by
Chambers and Engineering Dean
Barry Maxwell, but both he and
the president will continue to give
final review to all decisions
before passing them to the board
of trustees for final approval.

Wendell Smith’s role in the ad-
ministration will now focus more
closely on matters of University
planning and overall policy.
O’Brien said he will now concen-
trate his efforts in development
and fund raising for the multi-
million dollar ‘‘Campaign for the
80s’ to be announced within the
year.

Assistant to the Provost Judith
Becker will continue to review all
matters of employment because
of her dual role as the Universi-
ty’s Affirmative Action Officer.

Manning Smith, Chambers and
Maxwell will constitute a ‘‘kind of
administrative tenure commit-
tee’”’ because of the reorganiza-
tion, Chambers said.

No increase in salary is
planned for the new dean, who
has taught here since 1946.

It is not known yet if Smith will
retire when his position in the
College of Arts and Sciences ends
in 1983.

He will continue to teach part-
time in chemistry until then.

A reorganization of Campus
Security under the direction of
Vice President for Administra-
tion and Finance John Zeller has
resulted in increased hostilities
between the security officers and
the administration, according to
both the officers and Zeller.

This reorganization plan comes
on the heels of a vote by security
personnel to join a union several
months ago.

They are the first workers’
group to unionize in the history of
the University. ;

In the first formal meeting be-
tween the two sides since the
union vote, Security Corporal Ed
Roberts — who represents the of-
ficers — the union local president
and the local’s lawyer presented
University Controller F. Ellis
Harley Tuesday with a list of
demands including better work-
ing conditions, a wage increase
and improved retirement bene-
fits.

Harley was acting in place of
Zeller, who had routine surgery
the previous day.

The administration’s decision
to restructure security — a step
which involves replacing Chief of
Security Norman Fine with a new
security director — has led to
speculation that the University
administration is forcing Fine to
retire.

Zeller denied this, saying Fine
“had indicated a desire to
retire.”’ Plans for restructuring
the department have also been
underway ‘‘for some time,” he
said.

The administration postponed
advertising for a new director un-
til after the union election
because “It was not appropriate
to indicate we were going to
change the structure (of campus
security) or reorganize it in the
middle of the election process,”’
according to Zeller.

Provisions for the newly
created post require that the ap-

 plicant hold a bachelor’s degree,

preferably in the administration
of justice or a related field.
Preferred qualifications are a
master’s degree in public safety
management and a
demonstrated ability in exerting
leadership in a campus environ-
ment in order to promote student
safety and welfare, according to
the published job description.

Zeller said he hopes to improve
the quality of campus security by
only looking at candidates from
outside the present staff.

on.’

lian

The responsibilities of the new
director will include fire safety,
accident prevention, hazardous
waste disposal and enforcement
of the Occupational Safety and
Hazards Act.

“We wanted this not to be just a
law enforcement job,” Zeller
said.

But Roberts contends the ad-
ministration is ‘‘choosing to ig-
nore the fact’’ that the University
already has a chief of security

Crackdown on drinking to leave Greek-Week dry

By THOMAS DeCAIN

A shift in administration policy toward
the enforcement of campus alcohol con-
sumption regulations has made the hall
party and Swartz field beer celebrations a
thing of the past.

University policy states that ‘The con-
sumption of alcoholic beverages is pro-
hibited in the main public rooms or similar
common areas of the residence halls, in
non-residential University buildings, and
out-of-doors on the campus.”

However, tacit approval for keg parties
has been the standard. Gerald Commer-
ford, associate director of residential life,
said he has “‘looked the other way” when
hall parties were held in the past.

Such will not be the case this year, Com-
merford said. The University is now seek-
ing to strictly enforce the policy this year.

Last year, beer was served at Swartz
field during Greek Weekend festivities.
The beer was served in the parking lot of
an adjacent fraternity, while most of it
was consumed on _ University-owned
Swartz field.

This year, however, alcohol will not be
served outdoors. Fraternities will provide
the beverages only in their houses.

The graduation tent party, a University-
sponsored event, also dispemses a large
volume of beer. Traditionally held at the
athletic field next to the Davis Gym-
nasium, the party will be held again this

year and will continue to serve beer, ac-
cording to Commerford.

Hall parties which serve alcohol in
“public rooms” or in ‘‘common areas” are
prohibited. Fraternities and sororities are
permitted to serve alcohol because they
are privately owned or independently
operated. Most fraternities are owned by a
national headquarters, and each sorority
rents its suite from the University.

Although ‘‘The consumption of alcoholic
beverages is prohibited in...and out-of-
doors on campus,”’ Commerford said that
“if we tried to change the entire behavior
of students at once—especially all over the
campus—that would require many Gerry
Commerfords.”’

Persons have rarely been detained or ar-
rested by Campus Security, but it is uncer-
tain by what means the University will en-
force this rule.

According to Resident Director for
Roberts Hall, Libet Hall ’80, ‘‘Parties
should not be just tor one to get smashed.
Bucknell is looking beyond that and is try-
ing to have a greater concern for the in-
dividual. The law is important but secon-
dary.”

Residential Life, upon making its deci-
sion, informed its resident directors and
the resident assistants of the outcome. At
the first scheduled hall meeting the resi-
dent assistants were instructed to remind

Vice president hired after year-long delay

By JAN BALAKIAN

John A. Ferguson, executive
director of the Institute for Policy
Analysis in Indianapolis, Ind.
since 1977, took office June 1 as
vice president for University
relations.

University President Dennis
O’Brien attributed the one-year
search for the vice president to
the difficulty of the position. ‘‘We
wanted someone who would do
well in the developmental world
while having academic sensibili-
ty,” O’Brien said.

The absence of a vice president
for university relations last year
has had no adverse effects on
fund raising efforts, according to
O’Brien. ‘‘Last year was one of
our best years financially,’’ he
said.

The University is relying on
Ferguson’s leadership to meet a
1987 multi-million dollar fund

drive, the president said.

Ferguson, 36, meets the re-
quirement of being connected
with the foundation world and the
academic world. His work with
the Institute for Policy Anaylsis
has included research and policy
analysis, and evaluation and
planning for corporate, public
and private grant making agen-
cies and foundations. He
previously served as a staff
associate with the Carnegie Com-
mission on Higher Education.
From 1967-71, he held a variety of
positions at Wayne State Univer-
sity in Detroit.

Ferguson has also served as a
consultant to colleges and univer-
sities, professional associations,
corporations, civic organizations
and foundations.

An alumnus of Brown Universi-
ty, Ferguson received a master’s
degree from Wayne State and a

doctorate in higher education, .

economics and history from the
University of Michigan. Fer-
guson’s position will deal with all
areas of development. In an in-
terview with the Bucknellian this
week, he explained the three
aspects of development: deferred
giving, gifts from corporations
and foundations and the annual
fund, which provides ‘‘the last
ounce of flexibility in the Univer-
sity’s budget,’’ according to
Ferguson.

In addition, he will deal with
alumni affairs, publications and
public relations. Ferguson said
he is responsible for presenting
the image of Bucknell to the out-
side world.

Ferguson is reluctant to unveil
his views on higher education or
any transformations he would
like to see here because, he said,
he is ‘“‘still meeting people and

still learning.”

The only goals he spoke of were 3
those of increasing the Universi- §
ty’s annual giving to $1.25 million
and augmenting participation of
the alumni in fund raising.

Ferguson said he has always
been interested in the admini-
strative aspect of education.
“Since World War II, when state
institutions acquired a larger
population, there has been a bat-
tle to promote excellence in
private institutions.

“We need a healthy private
sector,’’ he said.

As he looks into the case of the
1980’s, Ferguson wants to spend
time with all aspects of the con-
stituency of the University and
find out what they want. “I want
to establish priorities from both
the capital point of view and an
educational point of view,’’ he

Workmen have rapidly completed the foundation and steel
framing of the new Computer Center. The complex,
located adjacent to the Dana Engineering building, is
scheduled to open to students in February. This is the first
major construction project the University has undertaken
since the completion of the field house in 1978.

Computer center finish

slated for mid-February

By GREG HAHN
Construction of the new computer and engineering center con-
tinues on schedule. The complex, located adjacent to the Dana
Engineering building, is scheduled to open Feb. 15.

The new building fulfills a variety of needs, according to John
Zeller, vice president for administration and finance. The present
computer is operating at full capacity and cannot meet the addi-
tional load required of it.

It has remained in use longer than its normal life expectancy,
creating a costly maintenance problem.

The new computer, a Honeywell unit, must operate in conjunc-
tion with the present system for about one year. This would not be
possible without the construction of a new center, Zeller said.

Unlike the computer in use now, the Honeywell unit will be hous-
ed in a fire-proof building which will also provide additional space
needed by the engineering department.

Costs for the entire computer center project exceed $3 million.
The computer system alone claims $1 million of the budget, with
conversion and transition costs expected to reach $300,000. The new
buildings and its furnishings are expected to cost $1.3 million.

Included in the computer center project is the remodeling of the
Dana Engineering building. Renovations are expected to cost close
to $250,000. The most costly item is a $135,000 sprinkler system to be
installed during the summer of 1982.

Four engineering labs have also been earmarked to receive
$200,000 worth of new equipment.

Funding for the center has been provided by corporate donations.
This covers about half of the total projected expenses to date. Ac-
cording to Zeller, there are no plans to solicit donations from alum-
nior parents.

The new Honeywell computer system will need to be replaced
with another new computer in about ten years, Zeller said.

Teamsters hope for success

where AFSCME has failed

By MADELON HENEHAN
The Teamsters and Chauffeurs Local Union No.
764 has begun a campaign to unionize non-
professional employees here.

The Teamsters efforts’ come after three years of
unsuccessful attempts to organize the same group
by the American Federation of State, County and
Municipal Employees (AFSCME).

Alfred Byrd, Secretary-Treasurer and Business
Representative of the Teamsters local, has been
working to organize the physical plant and dining
service employees since June.

It is uncertain whether AFSCME is still seeking to
unionize the same target group, however. William
Fogle, staff representative of AFSCME has not
been available for comment.

Employees have not received word from
AFSCME recently.

According to Byrd, the Teamsters is working in-
dependently to organize the non-professionals, and
will not work in cooperation with AFSCME.

Fogle has admitted to having spent ‘‘quite a bit of
money” in his unsuccessful campaign and stated in
August that he would ‘proceed with caution”’ if

University employees again expressed an interest
in union representation.

Non-professionals voted 3-1 against joining
AFSCME in April 1979.

Employee requests for representation led the
Teamsters to get involved, according to Byrd. The
Teamsters expect to be successful where AFSCME
has failed.

The Teamsters has sent letters and authorization
cards to employees. These cards, ask the employees
to designate the Teamsters as their sole bargaining
agent. If 30 percent of the employees return their
pledge cards to the union, the Teamsters will be
able to petition the National Labor Relations Board
(NLRB) for an election.

If a majority sign the cards, the union may ask
the NLRB to be their collective bargaining agent.

John Bell, director of the physical plant, is oppos-
ed to unionizing. ‘‘Workers do not need to belong toa
union,”’ he said.

“We do more for our workers than the union
which would bring a separation between employees
and management. The workers are our friends and
are treated as so. We don’t want to consider them as
anything different,” Bell said.

Ward °17 dies;

bequeaths gift
to University

A bequest to the University of
between $200,000 and $400,000 is
expected from the estate of Ethel
V. Ward, a Bucknell alumna and
local resident who died Aug. 29.

According to sources in the ad-
ministration, Ward — a 1917
graduate — had included a
substantial gift of this type in her
will, which is still in probate.

McClure & Light, the law firm
handling the Ward case, said it is
taking inventory of the estate
now, and will not release until
early next week the exact amount
of the gift.

FIREWORKS EXPLODE OVER STADIUM — The beginning of the
fall semester was ushered in by a display of pyrotechnics high
above Memorial Stadium Saturday night. The display was
part of the festivities that included an all-campus picnic on
Swartz field, entertainment by two bands and a frisbee show,
all sponsored by the University.

A resident of Lewisburg since
1972, Ward sold her house on St.
George Street to the University,
which uses it now as the campus’
official guest house. She served
as hostess of the house until
shortly before her death.

China replaces old
leaders with elderly

Three new deputy prime
ministers were appointed
Wednesday by the Chinese Na-
tional People’s Congress in Pek-
ing.

The appointments were part of
an effort to replace the aging
leadership, but the three new
leaders average 66 years of age.

Several of the retiring Chinese
leaders were in such frail health
that they had to be carried from
the Great Hall.

Unlike some of those who
retired, none of the new leaders is
considered a powerful figure.

= Fire hydrant system 1s updated as

physical plant tackles major projects

By MARY LISA MURGIANO
_ Workers at the physical plant
made scores of improvements
and renovations on campus this
summer, including an updating
of the University’s system of fire
hydrants, according to Physical
Plant Director John Bell.

One hydrant was removed
from outside Olin Science
Building because it did not have
adequate water flow, and the
hydrant opposite Swartz Hall was
replaced because its threads had
been reversed during installa-
tion.

These adjustments were
deemed necessary after local and
state fire agencies reviewed the
hydrant system in March, Bell
said.

In addition, the physical plant
is augmenting the present system
by extending a hydrant line to
Dent Drive and by adding more

George and Brown Streets.

Bell expressed relief that the
faulty fire hydrants were fixed
before there was a need to use
them.

Bell’s staff of almost 165
workers tackled other major pro-
jects this summer as well. New
trees were planted outside
Memorial Stadium, where seat
covers were installed in one sec-
tion to separate the Bucknell
spectator section from other
seats. The fence surrounding the
stadium was painted as well.

“Most people notice the im-
provements around them,”’ Bell
said, ‘‘but no one sees the things
buried under the ground,”’ refer-
ring to the replacement and up-
dating of a transformer system

for Taylor and Kress Halls and
the Botany Building.

The staff also modified and im-
proved electrical service to the
Sports/Recreation Complex,
Davis Gymnasium and Bucknell
West. This was accomplished by
switching a gear on two feeders
in the University Center so both
could be used simultaneously.

These major projects are just a
small portion of the work done at
the University in the past three

, months, Bell said. The physical

“plant also continued its usual
tasks of recementing and repav-
ing, painting classrooms and dor-
mitories, roofing, drainage
renovation and keeping the
University’s grounds in “top con-
dition.”” Some projects are still
underway.

up to Zeller’s office’ by Physical students and University proper-

Plant Director John Bell the day
after the union vote June 12 and

ty.
“We feel we should have this

shown a job advertisement for his training also for our personal

position.

Roberts said the reason most
people cited for voting in favor of
the offer made by the United

Plant Guard Workers was the
promise that unionization would
guarantee Campus Security per-
sonnel the full emergency train-
ing they say they are entitled to
receive as sworn police officers.

Roberts said the administra-
tion had refused ‘‘to allow us to
reorganize the department into a
useful organization.”’ The hiring
of a new security director with
additional qualifications would
produce all the changes in policy
“we have fought so hard to
receive,” he said.

As far back as 1976, the securi-
ty staff made a written request
“asking the University to send
the security men back to school to
have certified state training so
we can better protect the

safety,” the request said. “Our
job is no longer just a night
watchman’s.”’

Similar statements and re-
quests have been issued by
members of Campus Security
concerning fire preparedness,
possible relocation of the security
office and the need for 24-hour
campus security protection, ac-
cording to Roberts.

Security staff members say
that the sudden decision by the
administration to reorganize
after ignoring officers’ past re-
quests is a retaliation in response
to the recent unionization vote.

Bell categorically denied these
allegations. He said the work on
reorganization began more than
two years ago. He named in-
creased incidents of disorderly
conduct, tampering with fire
equipment, an increase in inter-
‘nal theft and a need to bring the
fraternities under University-
sponsored protection as reasons
which influenced the decision to
renovate campus protection.

“Things were leaning over too
much to the local police side
rather than the security side,”
Bell said.

According to the officers, the
administration contends that the
job of Campus Security is to be
simply the ‘‘eyes and ears” of the
campus and should not be in-
volved directly in apprehending
and arresting students or ad-

arise at the present time.

It would be a waste of time and
money to train security officers
to handle these emergencies and
major incidents, which occur on-
ly rarely, Bell said.

Fine sharply disagreed with
this statement, saying that within
the past few months Campus
Security had prevented an at-
tempted suicide by an under-
graduate student here “just in
time.” ~

A committee to select the new
security director is presently
reviewing applicants for the job.
The group — chaired by Dean of
Student Affairs John Dunlop and
including Director of Residential
Life Brenda Gordon, Associate
Professor of Sociology Matthew
Silberman, Bell and two recent
alumni — has already invited
three candidates here for inter-
views.

A spokesman for the group
would not predict how long the
selection process will last.

It is also unclear what will hap-
pen to the six officers already
employed here once a new chief
is hired. Should these men be
deemed ‘‘unqualified’’ by the new
director, they will be moved to
another department within the
University’s support staff, Bell
said.

Fine plans to retire effective

River bridge opens today

The river bridge spanning the Susquehanna River at the foot of
Market Street is scheduled to reopen today.

A ribbon-cutting ceremony featuring local officials such as the
mayor and Police Chief Donald Heiter was scheduled for 10a.m.

The festivities were to include a promotion in which the first
motorists to cross the newly refurbished bridge would receive
“Welcome back to Lewisburg” souvenir bags.

The bridge was closed July 14 for the replacement of a deteriorated
concrete deck and other modernization.

The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation had imposed a 60-
day limit on the contractor, Zeisloft Construction Co. of Bloomsburg,
and the group finished work 48 hours before the deadline.

‘Additional work which can be done while the bridge is in use is
scheduled to be completed by the end of November.

University convocation

marks start of semester

By ROBIN MEREDITH

Increased attendance marked
the 134th annual Bucknell Con-
vocation last week with sources
estimating as many as one-third
more persons in attendance, over
last year’s record. There was
also greater attendance by facul-
ty members and upperclassmen.

The attendance record is at-
tributed to the new location of the
ceremonies, which in the past
have been held in Rooke Chapel.
This year’s convocation took
place in the Freshman Quad.

President Dennis O’Brien
spoke on changes in attitudes of
students. He called his address:
“We don’t need no education.”

Explaining the significance of
the line taken from Pink Floyd’s
best selling album ‘‘The Wall,”
O’Brien received an ovation for
his quotation of the chorus of
“Brick in the Wall.”

Recovering with the remark,
“What is this world coming to?,”’
O’Brien went on to assert Plato’s

Local police to provide emergency service

By CATHY NAGEL
and MATT KARANIAN
The Lewisburg Police Depart-
ment has contracted an agree-
ment with the nearby township of
Union to answer emergency calls
in that area.

According to Lewisburg Police
Chief Donald Heiter, the contract
is in effect for a trial six-month
period, after which time it may or
may not be renewed.

The contract went into effect
Aug. 19. Union township will pay
Lewisburg police $15 per hour in
overtime pay for calls to which it
responds. The agreement calls
for Lewisburg to answer only
emergency calls in Union.

the students of the policy and
stress that it would be enforced.

One R.A. said that he had
become a watch-dog for the
police, and he might not have
taken the position had he known
of the policy in advance. ‘“‘They
just sprang it on us when we got
here,”’ he said.

The Resident Director for
Swartz Hall, Missy Farmer, said
the change has come about
because of ‘‘a new alcohol
awareness which is spreading
across the country. Students can
drink in their rooms just as their
home,”’ Farmer said.

Hall and several resident
assistants say the University is
enforcing the ban to release itself
from any liabilities which might
result if the University allowed
alcoholic consumption on its pro-
perty.

None referred to a particular
instance, however, in which a stu-
dent was injured directly because
alcohol was served at a hall par-
ty.

view that “changes in musical
style are always accompanied by
profound changes in the culture
of the people.”

Referring to his younger days,
the president then traced the
path of popular music to the pre-
sent, drawing parallels with the
student’s attitude on the college
campus through each time seg-
ment and commenting on the
changes in the institutions of
youth itself.

“Rock is not a music of talk,
but show; not mediacy but im-
mediacy.’’ He furthered that no-
tion by adding, ‘‘I believe it says
something significant to move
from music of delay to a music of
demand, from music of ‘give me’
to ‘gotcha’.””

O’Brien concluded that
while there may be some
disagreement on whether college
is the last refuge of youth or the
first stage of adulthood, we are
all heading in the same direction.

month period to aid in the handl-
ing of extra calls.

Lewisburg is also maintaining
a mutual agreement with East
Buffalo Township for each of the
forces to respond to calls in the
other’s township in event of
emergency.

In a statement to students,
Heiter said he hoped students
would “behave and act like you
would in your own home.

“We're here to help the
students. If they have any pro-
blems or need assistance, we’re
glad to help,’’ Heiter said, adding
that calls about illegal handguns
on campus were answered ‘‘im-
mediately”’ by his force last year.

According to Commerford, an
accident at Delaware Valley Col-
lege in 1978 in which a student
was killed has led to concern at
Bucknell and other Pennsylvania
schools. The student had been
drinking at a college sponsored

Registrar releases G.P.A.
stats; women score well

By MATT KARANIAN
The mean grade point average
for undergraduate students here
last semester was 2.9, according
to statistics recently released by
the Office of the Registrar.

Women consistently scored
higher G.P.A.s than did the men,
and all non-fraternity men and
women scored higher than the
fraternity men and women.

The Registrar’s statistics ap-
pear to indicate that a trend of
steady improvement occurs with
students. Mean grade point
averages for men are recorded as
2.7 for freshmen, 2.8 for
sophomores, and 3.0 for juniors
and seniors.

G.P.A.s for women range from
2.9 for freshmen and sophomores
to 3.2 for juniors and 3.3 for
seniors. Senior women
statistically scored the highest
averages of any group recorded
by the Office of the Registrar.

“Students are here for four
years, and are citizens here for
four years. Anywhere they go,
they will always have ties with

that he would produce files on
any student at the University

Better late than never?

The University has finally decided that it is time to streamline
the Campus Security force, and it has begun to accomplish this goal
by seeking a new director of security, ‘“‘a professional” who will ‘‘tell
us how to reorganize our operation,” in the words of John Zeller.

We can see nothing wrong with this. The men on the force of
Campus Security are—by their own admission— a group of night
watchmen. They are not confident of their ability to deal with the
most crucial emergencies that can occur anytime on campus.

This is not by matter of choice, however. Since 1976, Campus
Security officers have been sending written requests to the ad-
ministration asking for more and better education; they sought to go
back to school to receive certified state training that would enable
them to better protect the students, University property and
themselves.

The security forces voted to join a union June 12 and im-
mediately following this decision the University countered with their
new plan for reorganization. Although Zeller and John Bell contend
they have been planning this action for some time, the patrolmen see
more significance in this ‘“‘better late than never”’ policy.

The officers now fear they may become obsolete when the new
plan is implemented and the “‘new man” at the top takes over. They
do not want to be the victims of what they see as the punitive
backlash as a result of their unprecedented decision to become
unionized. Will a rapport with students, years of experience with
this University and the officers’ continuous and significant plea for
state training result in a stamp of ‘‘Unqualified’”’ once Chief Norman
Fine’s 20-year tenure here ends in December? We hope not.

The campus is long overdue for a better system of campus
security and the officer’s plea for training must be answered.
Continued evasiveness and procrastination by the University on
aie ae is clearly detrimental to what could be a matter of life
and death.

To beer or not to beer

A seemingly major policy shift in the University’s enforcement of
its public drinking regulations has gone into effect, and we see both
good and bad aspects to the change.

Except for football games, the administration has, for the most
part, failed to enforce its policy against consuming alcohol outdoors
and in the public areas of residence halls. Now, it has pronounced a
major crackdown on such drinking.

The traditional freshman hall keg parties and open carousing on
Swartz field now seem to be a thing of the past. Perhaps the Univer-
sity feels that a freshman’s exposure to alcohol should be the respon-
sibility solely of the fraternities.

Whatever the intent of the policy change and its effects on student
drinking habits, we must admit that there are benefits to be gained
from the move. Although the parties are gone, so is the resulting
destruction of Trax and Kress Halls. Freshmen will also have a
chance to adjust to college life before being bombarded with endless
bottles of Budweiser.

However, any gains are overshadowed by what we feel is a double
standard in the policy: the University will continue to permit alcohol
at the annual graduation tent party.

We feel that a more specific policy should be formulated, and that
the traditional administration haziness on discipline questions be
reduced. A new attitude is fine, but uniformity and clarity in en-
forcement has always been sorely lacking, and this must be
changed.

Drafting tables, dynamite

We have long reiterated that the quality of the student body is cor-
relative to its organizations and extracurricular activities. In the
past, we have crammed for hours in the dingy basement of Roberts
Hall to produce the best student newspaper possible given a severe
lack of facilities and equipment.

Last spring we cried out to the administration for help, and John
Zeller, John Bell and Bob Millward answered. The Bucknellian of-
fice has a new look and we aren’t dingy anymore. ae

While the mere request for a paltry drafting table incited a
crashing scrutiny from our peers on the ABS Appropriations Com-
mittee, the Physical Plant diligently decimated the basement with
dynamite to create some new office space for us. The walls are
bright white, the carpet royal blue. Our office is no longer a cellar.
Thanks.

Stereo wars: sensurround in the freshman quad

By TODD G. BUCHHOLZ

Freshman are curious
creatures. They’re fun, novelty
items to watch and laugh at.
Believe me, the animal behavior
folks forget their baboons and
rhesus monkeys when the
species, Freshman walks by.

The Freshman quad, where,
like Great Adventure, one can see
Frosh in their natural habitat, is
marked by blaring music. Not
just loud, but the kind they used
in the movie ‘‘Earthquake’’ to
achieve the sensurround effect.

Sometimes I wonder how stable
Kress and Trax are.

To be fair, I admit the
cacophony usually comes from
the men’s dorms. Why? Welcome

to the pop-psychology show.

After guys are left here by
Mom and Dad, their egos and
senses of security and masculini-
ty are vulnerable. Nobody cares
that you were voted ‘‘jock of the
century” at Mifflinburg High
School. Nobody wants to hear
about your girlfriends or the car
you left back home.

What then, can you do to tell the
world what a gift you are? How
does the male freshman Bucknel-
lensis assert his masculinity?

He simply attaches a few wires
and jacks, arranges his speakers,
and bombards the cosmos with
Foreigner.

Sure, everybody on campus has

THE
BUCH
STOP

freshmen guys feel obligated to
their egos to let the world share in
their quest for security and
recognition.

Walk by the frats. Unless
there’s a band party, the music
levels are pretty low. The up-
perclass dorms are reasonably
quiet. In fact, often you can hear

some nice jazz or even classical
tunes, as scandalous as that may
sound. Yes, only Kress and Trax
sound like the setting of
“Apocalypse Now.”

Last year the two guys next to
my room had a passion for noise.
Strangely, this passion grew
more intense in proportion to my
need for sleep and the lateness of
the hour.

Remember the big bang theory
of creation? It started next door
tomy room.

So one day, while blasting a
racket that could have awoken
Rip Van Winkle, or at least
tumbled Jericho, my neighbors
were emasculated, symbolically
of course.

Their tweeters broke. All was
silent, except for the cries of the
castrati neighbors.

How terrible it was for John

horrid.

How delightful.

That day I learned how the
Britons must have felt when the
bombing stopped.

In time, of course, the tweeters
were repaired and the bombing
resumed. But that brief respite
was my ‘‘finest hour.”

Yes, my roommate and I had a

The collectivists: out on the left wing

By RICHARD PISANO

One of the unpublicized and
least discussed topics at
Bucknell is that our political
science and economics depart-
ments have been overrun by pro-
fessors who are collectivist.

For those unfamiliar with the
term, Fredrich Hayek defines
collectivism as ‘“‘the deliberate
organization of the labors of
society for a definite social goal.”
This includes Marxists, Maoists
and Social Democrats.

The administration satisfies
itself by stating that the Universi-
ty, as a whole, is ideologically

“balanced.” And, as a whole,
Bucknell is balanced, for in-
stance, in the management
department there are quite a few
supporters of the free-market
system.

However, in the departments
where politics is being taught as a
field of study and where ideo-
logical beliefs play into the
course matter directly, Bucknell
students are being presented with
only one point of view.

Most professors in introductory
level courses attempt to present
many points of view to their
classes, but in upper level

courses this is not the case.

It is hard for me to imagine
Professor Steve Stamos taking a
pro-multinational corporation
position in his developing coun-
tries course, or Professor Dick
Peterec arguing with conviction
for a free-market position, in the
current events portion of every
political geography class. These
two professors are among the
best at the University and enroll-
ment in their classes will pro-
bably continue to be outstanding.

But Bucknell is doing its stu-
dent body an injustice by not

employing professors who will:

argue just as dynamically and
persuasively from an opposing
point of view.

Before a new professor is hired,
many applications are screened
by a department. A few ap-
plicants:are then asked to come
to the University where they are

interviewed by interested
students and the professors in the
department.

The department then makes a
recommendation to the ad-
ministration whose job it is to
make the final offer.

When a department recom-
mends applicants of only one
political persuasion, the Univer-
sity will hire only professors of
the persuasion.

If the administration were to
ask a department to hire a pro-
fessor primarily on the basis of
ideology, a cry would sound that
the administration was violating
the “‘academic freedom” of the
professor.

Academic freedom refers to
the freedom of a professor to
teach what he sees fit, as he sees
fit, without outside interference.

On paper, academic freedom
would seem to insure an environ-

ment in which a student could
learn from many points of view.
Inreality, academic freedom has
been a cloak behind which collec-
tivist professors have been able
to strike at the social and
economic foundations of our
society without opposition.

I agree with William F.
Buckley, Jr., when he said that
academic freedom should mean
“freedom of men and women to
supervise the educational ac-
tivities and aims of the schools
they oversee and support.”’

The University’s primary
responsibility should be to pro-
vide an excellent, balanced
education for its students.

Unfortunately, President
O’Brien’s administration has met
this commitment with rhetoric
only.

If the feathers in the caps of
some of the departments have to
be ruffled to provide a balanced
education, it is certainly worth
doing so.

Someday if there is enough
pressure exerted on President
O’Brien by the students, alumni
and especially trustees, I am con-
fident that his administration will

act.

Cereb FS pei oe a
ABS officials explain goals for the fall semester

To The Editor:

“The legitimate object of
government is to do for a com-
munity of people whatever they
need to have done, but cannot do
at all in their separate and in-
dividual capacities,’ said
Abraham Lincoln approximately
120 years ago.

At Bucknell, the Association of
Bucknell Students (ABS) at-
tempts to follow Lincoln’s max-
im. The ABS is concerned with all
aspects of student life. And it is
responsible for taking ap-
propriate action when issues of
concern to students arise.

Although many students are
very skeptical of the ABS’s in-
fluence in the decision making
process at Bucknell, the ABS has
recently been successful in
changing two University policies
and is working hard to reform
several others.

For example, last year the ABS.
helped establish a midterm break
for the 1980 Fall semester. After
continued attempts, the ABS was
able to persuade the Administra-
tion to accept a plan to change
recycling from a voluntary effort
to an official University policy.
This included the cessation of in-
cinerator use in Marts and Cole-

man Halls.

For these successes to con-
tinue, students must work
together. We should remember
the importance of student activi-
ty in maintaining a vibrant and
creative college community. The
quality of education at Bucknell
is in jeopardy as costs of educa-
tion continue to rise.

It is in the entire Bucknell com-
munity’s interest to get the most
out of our human and material
resources. If our wasteful ex-
travagance continues, the quality
of education and life at Bucknell
will be stunted in the years
ahead.

We students can prevent a
qualitative erosion by focusing
our combined energies on press-
ing problems. If we do not
cooperate, we will defeat
ourselves.

To avoid this, the ABS will
work closely with other student
groups and with the faculty and
administration. For student goals
to be fulfilled, we must act
responsibly and lead by example.
Toward this end, ABS Steering
Committee efforts this semester
will focus primarily on reforming
University policy.

Our agenda will include:

Although I was in the band in
high school and could read music,
I didn’t know Weelkes from Welk.
So I bought the books and the
records. Every note ever sung or
sneezed was available.

We had these insidious listen-
ing quizzes and had to memorize
symphonies and regurgitate com-
posers, dates, movements and
social security numbers. To
study, you must listen and listen
to ths same melodies until your
diamond needle scratches
through the Norton records.

April 5, was monk week. Who
was your favorite? If you’ve got
nothing to do Saturday night,
listening to some Gregorian
chants could really make you ap-
preciate celibacy. Maybe the
cafeteria will serve monk bread,
if you ask.

So I’m listening to some monks
loudly chanting ‘Gaudeamus
Omnes” for those who don’t
speak Latin it means ‘‘Come and
get it supper’s ready’’), when a
hallmate kicks my door open
screaming, ‘What the hell is that
moaning?

“T thought someone was hurt,”
he said.

Some people just don’t ap-
preciate art. Our music professor
said that ‘““Gaudeamus Omnes”
was Top 40 stuff at the
monasteries.

Back to the class of 1984. If you
really want to demonstrate your
manliness, be an_ individual,
distinguish yourself form from
your peers.

Listen to moaning monks, buy
your own curtains and for God’s
sake turn down that noise.

Remember it’s the guy who
blows his horn the loudest who is
usually in the fog.

1. The creation of a more sup-
portive University policy towards
student activities.

Adequate space for campus
organizations will be sought. The
ABS will work for a more com-
plementary relationship between
student activities and the cur-
riculum. Of particular interest
will be the emphasis placed on
forms of creative expression such
as journalism, and on community
oriented studies.

For example, a civil engineer-
ing project to develop a design for
the newly dedicated Hufnagle
Park in Lewisburg will be pur-
sued and encouraged.

There are many potential
benefits to be derived from
eliminating some of the rigidity
which exists between student ac-
tivities and curriculum, ranging
from a broader educational ex-
perience to fighting inflation by
increasing community  self-
reliance.

2. The elimination of waste in-
cluding vandalism.

A major goal is recycling in the
waste disposal process by the end
of this year. Also, reminders to
students about food and energy
waste will be highly visible.

We should remember that we
pay for waste with our tuition
dollars.

3. The formation of a Public In-
terest Research Group (PIRG).

A PIRG is a non-profit, non-
partisan corporation set up and
run by students to improve life in
the community. For example,
PIRG’s in Oregon fought bottlers’
efforts to repeal a returnable-
bottle law.

If current student activities
funds were insufficient, a
Bucknell PIRG might be funded
by an increase in the student ac-
tivities fee, all of which would re-
main completely under the con-
trol of the ABS Appropriations
Committee.

For an increase to take effect, a
campus-wide referendum, to be
decided by a majority vote,
would have to be held.

4. Greater student participa-
tion in the selection of com-
mencement speakers.

5. We remain very interested in
intercollegiate cooperation.

WELCOME

The Steering Committee is op-
timistic about the potential im-
pact of a more unified national
student movement.

These objectives are within our
reach and are compatible with
the goals of the University. Their
implementation would help pave
the road to a heightening of a
sense of community at Bucknell
and among University and area
residents.

As college students, we have
the time, energy and resources
needed to take the lead in ad-
vocating the cooperative ap-
proaches, short-run sacrifices
and long-term thinking essen-
tial for maintaining the
liberty and standard of living

cherished by us and dreamed of
by many.

Let us not take for granted our
current prosperity. Its social and
economic bases were founded on
cheap energy and an expanding
labor force—two conditions that
no longer exist. ,

An active student movement is
crucial for developing the com-
munity spirit to overcome the
shortcomings of the past and the
challenges of the future. Let us
get on with the job.

Campus inspires transfer student

By CATHY BRITT

After spending my freshman year at
Albany State University, I made the big
switch to Bucknell.

My reasons for leaving weren’t com-
plicated. Although I’ve left many friends
behind, I wanted to attend a smaller
university where instead of being a
number on a computer, I would be an in-
dividual.

Academic considerations also entered
into the move. As a sophomore currently
majoring in elementary education, I was
impressed by the program made available
tome.

Photo—Public Relations
BUT WHERE DO | GO NOW? The alpha-
bet is always harder than it looks.
Upperclass guides led bewildered frosh
through registration.

From the first moment I stepped into
Lewisburg, I was happy with my decision.
Albany’s campus is located on flat ground,
and all the buildings and dormitories are
built of white cement. During the winter,
heavy snowfall turns the entire area white,
and, after a while, it becomes bleak and
depressing.

The trees and Georgian brick of
Bucknell is certainly a welcome change.
It’s so much easier to study in a place that
actually looks and feels like a college,
rather than a hospital.

Friday, September 12, 1980

The main impetus for my transfer was
that at Albany there was an average of 400
to 500 students in each of my classes, a
number I felt was far too high to receive
any individual attention from the faculty.
At Bucknell, the number has decreased to,
at most, 30.

It’s not that my former professors
weren’t interested in their students; it’s
just that here professors are able, through
reduced class size, to do so much more.
For one thing, I couldn’t believe that in-
structors here actually learn their stu-
dents’ names.

An important facet of education, class
discussion, was absent at Albany. In a
class of 400, it just wasn’t feasible, as long
lectures were the order of the day. Here,
judging from professors’ comments and
the first few days of classes, discussion is a
much larger part of the learning process.
Before, no one would think to ask a ques-
tion in class. There was simply too many
people.

I think Bucknell students should be
grateful for the chance to discuss subjects
and exchange ideas, rather than being just
human tape recorders.

As for the disadvantages, I have found it
more difficult to become acquainted with
my fellow classmates as a transfer than I
did when I was a freshman.

Freshmen all make friends with each
other quickly as they are all in the same
situation. But not knowing anyone and be-
ing away from home for the first time is
different for me, and there are very few
transfers here.

Part of the problem is that I’ve been
placed in a special interest house, rather
than a dorm. I miss the atmosphere of dor-
mitory life and the activities hall groups
plan. Only yesterday did my roommate
and I venture to the third floor of Seventh
Street House to meet our housemates.

Another aspect I miss is city life itself.
At Bucknell, everything is self contained;
if you don’t have a car, you don’t leave
campus much.

At Albany, bus services were available
to shopping malls, theatres and museums.
In Lewisburg, students are more at the
mercy of what campus life offers.

Despite these difficulties, students have
been friendly. Through my classes and ex-
tracurricular activities, I’m meeting
many people. It’s a bit lonely at first, but in
a month or so as I get settled in, I believe
T’'ll feel more confident in my decision to
transfer.

Freshman camp provides head start

By SUE CHIAVETTA

Do you like bugs up your nose? How
about cold showers and human knots? If
the answer to these questions is yes, you
would have enjoyed this year’s Freshman
Camp.

Held Labor Day weekend at Cowan, ap-
proximately eight miles from campus, this
two-day adventure was one of the most
unique learning experiences you could
ever hope to encounter. For the most part,
close to 100 freshmen and upperclass
counselors square danced, played human
bingo and held touchie-feelie sessions.
Although they may seem silly to outsiders,
campers really enjoyed these and other
lighthearted activities.

The inevitable discomforts of camping
life were taken good-naturedly. ‘‘Two cold
showers with sixty guys made it an un-
forgettable experience,” shrugged John
Held ’84.

Despite the crazy games for zany peo-
ple, Freshman Camp had its more serious
moments as well. It gave members a
chance to meet professors, deans and
President O’Brien himself. More im-
portantly, 76 freshmen had the opportunity
to get acquainted with each other before
the hassle of classes began.

“It was a good experience. If I hadn’t
gone, I would not feel as much at home as I
do now. It’s great to see familiar faces
around campus,” said Julie Reed ’84. Her
words were underscored by Ruth Bur-
nham, assistant director of student ac-
tivities. ‘The goal of Freshman Camp was
to give its participants a headstart on
Bucknell life. Just a few new friends help.”

In addition to promoting friendships,
Freshman Camp brought many pairs of
roommates together for the first time.
“When we arrived back at school on Tues-
day morning, we were no longer homesick
or scared.

“We already knew each other,’ said
Wendy Denton ’84. New roommates Guy

Zaybakian and Chris Knudson took it one
step further. After they met, they decided
to play their guitars together for the
camp’s meditation period and ended the
night taking requests by the campfire.

The enthusiasm of the freshmen was
matched by that of the upperclassmen in-
volved. ‘‘Not only did the camp provide a
headstart for freshmen, it strengthened
bonds of friendship between counselors,”
said Laura Callahan ’83. The only
criticism many of them shared was the
shortness and limited enrollment of the
weekend. “I wish two or three sessions of
the camp could be held, so all freshmen
who wanted to could attend. Asi is, many of
them had to be turned away.”

“Every year we consider if the disad-
vantages of not being able Ww ac-
commodate all students interested
outweighs the advantages oe the camp,”

said James Hammerlee, director
dent activities. “So far, we’ve co!
that they don’t. The lottery systen
perfect, but it’s fair, and every s
that mails in his application on time:
equal chance. Logistically, thei
other way to doit.”

A second camp held the week
school began was given a try severa
ago. However, by that time most st
had become so involved in class
freshman hall activities that the i
was no longer there. “It has to be di
weekend before classes,” concluded
merlee.

It is unfortunate that more stude!
not attend Freshman Camp. But

did.

Tests fail to spark curiosity among students;
freshmen and upperclassmen remain apathetic

By LYNNE RUTHERFORD

Each year, freshmen are herded into
auditoriums throughout campus and sub-
jected to a barrage of questions entitled
the Freshman Testing Program. Judging
from their remarks, few of these students
enjoy or even understand this practice.

“Tm sure the tests served a purpose, but
I don’t know what. At 8:00 in the morning,
I’d rather be asleep.” This remark by
Wendy Geeney ’84 seemed representative
of her class’ general attitude concerning
the exams. The apathy, however, extends
to upperclassmen, some of whom never
bothered to view their test results. “Just
plain laziness, 1 guess,” admitted Shari
Holmes ’82.

I’m sure the tests served
a purpose, but I don’t know
what. At 8:00 in the morn-

ing, I’drather be asleep.
Wendy Geeney ’84

——_—_—
The obscure nature of many of the ques-

tions helps contribute to student puzzle-
ment over the purpose of the tests. In-
quiries on preference of carrot cooking
styles and sleeping habits are but two ex-
amples. This year, in response to a more
recent question, freshmen can be found
walking up steps counting how many stairs
they take at a time.

“No deep, underlying meaning is behind
any of our questions. Our intention is to
collect large amounts of data on an incom-
ing class of freshmen, then group their
answers according to what they decide to
major in. When future students come
along, we check their answers and see
what majors they fit into,” explained Dr.
David Wilder, director of the counseling
service.

Actually, the interest test for predicting
majors was absent this year, having been
dropped in favor of a Student Information

Form. This form supplied demographic
and factual information to the University
on its new students. Dr. Wilder hopes,
however, to eventually restore the interest
test because it was ‘‘one of the most ac-
curate predictors of college majors we
possess.”’

Just what can the tests be used for? “If a
person is not sure where his or her in-
terests lie, we can point out suitable
courses they may have missed. But the
tests are only guides; they are not infalli-
ble,” answered Dr. Wilder.

It is also possible, by perusing different
sections of the testing program, to judge
why a student is not doing as well as he

may like scholastically. ‘“‘That’s what all
those questions on study habits and self
motivation are about,” Wilder continued.
Briefly, the tests can be used to measure
quality of work habits, scholastic attitude
and practical ability.

Even if you’ve waited two years to find
out your results, Wilder says you're not too
late. Freshman tests can support students
in their choice of a major, or point them in
the right direction if they’re planning a
switch. Don’t expect miracles; but the
Freshman Testing Program is as good a
guide to the future as your average
horoscope.

| WONDER WHY THEY PUT ME IN THIS CLASS Weary underclassmen fall into line
once again, this time to wait for scheduling help.

Parties and books combine quickly

By DAVE ENGLEHARDT and
STEPHEN A. HABETZ

After the final good-byes were said and
parents left campus, freshmen were
plunged into a new lifestyle where they
would have to rely more on themselves
and give up the comforts of familiar faces
and places. We now have to take respon-
sibility for our lives; there is no one there
tolend a hand when we fall.

The ties to home must be loosened tem-
porarily. For some freshmen the ex-
perience is totally new, and many have
spent moments missing family and friends
while at the same time trying to get
started on a new social and academic
career.

Everyone is handling this pressure dif-
ferently. One member of our class, a resi-
dent of 1st Kress, is surrounding his room
with a myriad of STAR WARS
memorabilia. Figurines, lunch boxes,
blankets; they’re all there. He must havea
very understanding roommate. Then, of
course, there is the wandering candidate
for Freshman Class President, whose en-
tire wardrobe seems to consist of a blue
suit and green sneakers. Most members of
the Class of ’84, however, are using their
new freedom in more conventional ways.

The first few days held a spree of
meetings, official welcomes and

assemblies, as well as the first taste of col-
lege classes. Fortunately, the first few
days also featured parties. They were
everywhere, and students scrambled to -
make new friends. Although during our
first hall meeting we were informed of the
abolition:of hall parties, this dilemma was
easily solved. In fact, the first few nights
were non-stop bashes. Even convocation

couldn’t dampen the spirits.

No matter how grade-
minded you are, an impor-
tant part of college is mak-
ing friends. In ten years,
your grade on a history
paper will be forgotten, but
friends may last a lifetime.

ES
During his convocation speech, Presi-

dent O’Brien warned us about the evils of
rock music, particularly Pink Floyd’s
song, ‘Another Brick in the Wall.” Of
course, that song could be heard blasting
out frosh windows only seconds after the
assembly ended.

O’Brien’s critique of rock music was ob-
viously derived from a recent issue of Roll-

ing Stone and was not particularily well
received. However, his encouragement
that a student be both socially-minded and
scholarly is pertinent to every collegian.

There was the one freshman who
remarked, ‘This place would be excellent
if it weren’t for classes. You know, if it
could be like a summer camp where you
drink beer, play frisbee and have a good
time.” Yet certainly most freshmen
realize that it will take some effort to suc-
ceed at Bucknell. Throughout the first
week, freshmen experimented with their
new freedom and rocked the dorms. Then
Friday’s start of classes brought respon-
sibility to temper the freedom. Even the
hard-core partiers of 4th Trax began stu-
dying.

The second half of the President’s con-
vocation advice also applied. No matter
how grade-minded you are, an important
part of college is making friends. In ten
years, your grade on a history paper will
be forgotten, but friends may last a
lifetime. Most freshmen have been open
and eager to get to know one another, and
the parties certainly haven’t hurt. All in
all, this first week has brought freedom
and responsibility, departure and arrival
and, already, a lot of memories.

in U.C. Cave today

The stage is set for Bucknell’s
1980-1981 cocktail series, starting
with ‘‘The Zoo Story” by Edward
Albee and ‘‘The Island” by Athol
Fugard.

Featured in the performances
tonight, tomorrow and Sunday
nights are Tom Ryersback
(Peter) and Steve Perry (Jerry),
both of Williamsport, in “‘The Zoo
Story.” Jawaad Abdul-Aziz and

James Symmons, associate pro-
fessor of theater at Bucknell.
Symmons plans to produce and
act in a third play in the near
future entitled ‘‘Bloodnot.”

“The Zoo Story” and ‘The
Island” are being performed at 7

The Bucknell Jazz and Rock
Ensemble (BJRE) completed
work on its third album last
April. The album includes nine
cuts ranging from Count Basie to
Earth, Wind and Fire. Also in-
cluded is dixieland, be-bop, con-
temporary jazz and a surprise
novelty cut featuring the Bison
Chips. The new album has been
called the best put out by BJRE
since the group’s inception.

The Bison Chips, Bucknell’s
barbershop quartet, was also at
work last spring on their first
album. The album — 18 cuts in all
— includes such classics as “In
the Mood” and “Sentimental
Journey” as well as the Chip’s
four part harmony on everyone’s
favorite Bucknell songs in the
vein of ‘‘Go Bisons.”

Both albums are scheduled to
be available in the bookstore
sometime in the coming week.

‘Southside’ to play at Bucknell Oct. 4.

Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes will open the Bucknell Con-
cert Committee’s slate this year with a performance at 8 p.m., Oct. 4,
in Davis Gymnasium.
The Jukes, whose song ‘“‘Havin’ a Party” is popular with Bucknell
students, are on tour to follow up the release of their newest album,
“Love is a Sacrifice.”
Chris Petermann 81, chairman of the Concert Committee, was
unable to answer questions about the Jukes’ warm-up act, stating that
the group would supply the other band.
This concert will serve, according to Petermann, as a “sort of
testing ground” for future concerts. Because of the difficulties en-
countered by the Concert Committee last year in maintaining a
satisfactory budget, the group is not scheduling any more concerts un-
til they ‘“‘see how this one goes.”’
“we have to prove our financial soundness,” Petermann said. ‘Last
year we lost our shirts, and we can’t let that happen again this year. It
would be a big plus if this concert went over well. We're going for a big
one.”
Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes have cut five albums since
their first collection, ‘I Don’t Want to go Home,” appeared in 1976, but
- it wasn’t until the release of their third album, ‘Hearts of Stone,”’
which contained many of their biggest hits, including “Talk to Me,”
that the group’s reputation took off. Now the Jukes, along with
“Southside” Johnny Lyon, are one of the hottest groups on the college
campus. Their single “On the Beach” was popular this summer.
“Some bands are recording bands,” said Petermann, “and some
bands are concert bands. The Jukes is definitely a concert band, andI >

Diane Burko’s Blue Paintings

on display in Center Gallery

|

By DAVID BLACKMAN

The Center Gallery opened its
fall season Monday night with the
traditional reception that has ac-
companied each new exhibit in
the past. The five works present-
ly being displayed on the third
floor of the University Center are
those of noted Philadelphia land-
scape artist Diane Burko.

A native of Brooklyn, New
York, Burko is a graduate of
Skidmore College and the
Graduate School.of Fine Arts of
the University of Pennsylvania,
and is presently teaching at the
Philadelphia Community Col-
lege. Her paintings have been
displayed nationally and her
works have been purchased by a
number of corporations and
museums.

To create the realism in her
works, Burko uses her own
original slides of mountain
ranges throughout the world, pro-
jecting them onto her studio wall.
From these beginnings she con-
tinues with a unique process of
tracing with pencil those aspects
of nature which will be included
in each particluar work, fre-
quently departing from the
original elements of her
photographs. Her technique con-
veys a serious respect for the
remote vastness of the moun-
tains.

Burko originally gained
notoriety with the presentation of
a series done in the same style
and technique as ‘‘Blue Paint-
ings’? but based on the Grand
Canyon in Arizona.

In a recent interview with the
Philadelphia Inquirer Sunday
Magazine, Burko said of her style
“T’m playing with facts, I’m not
reporting fact. I often play
around with the sequence of
slides. I alter everything for the
sake of the picture.

“As I work, the ideas come. It’s
spontaneous and intuitive. What
people should see is aesthetic
relationships, abstract relation-
ships that go beyond description
to what art is all about,” she said.

Burko will be lecturing on her
work September 22 at. 2 p.m. in
the University Center Forum.
Her exhibit will remain on the
Bucknell campus until Sep-
tember 29.

‘Airplane!

’ comedic

spoof of melodrama

By BRUCE BOWEN

What do you get when you cross
a number of serious actors with a
script of total satire? The answer
is Airplane!, a quite successful
and thoroughly joyous comedy
which has the potential to become
a standard for which future films
in the genre will aim.

Airplane!, which opens tonight
at the Campus Theatre on Market
Street, has been hailed by many
as a high quality comedy, in the
same category as classics like
Animal House and the Pink Pan-
ther and Monty Python series.

Never before, though, has there
been any real attempt at creating
a parody on the disaster movie,
so common in the past ten years.

Airplane! has successfully
done just that: spoof the disaster
movie, and it did against
several summer ‘‘blockbuster’’
movies, even as a low budget
film.

Based on the 1950’s classic Zero
Hour, and incorporating bits
from the Airport-type disaster
movies of the 1970’s with a dash of
Saturday Night Fever, Airplane!
transforms these films’ attempts
at serious drama into some of the
best spoof to hit the screen since
Woody Allen began making
serious movies.

Probably Airplane!’s most suc-
cessful move was in the casting
itself. Though the script itself is
quite funny, seeing actors like
Robert Stack, Lloyd Bridges,
Peter Graves and Leslie Nielsen
delivering these lines adds just
that much more of a satirical im-
pact to the film.

Jim Abrahams, David Zucker
and Jerry Zucker of Kentucky
Fried Movie fame wrote the
screenplay and directed the film,
and the fact that the final product
is the result of several rewrites is
a tribute not only to their
perseverance with the project,
but also to the refined quality of
the film.

Lead roles in Airplane! are left
for two newcomers. Robert Hays
comes fresh off a successful stint
on the television series ‘‘Angie,”
while Julie Hagerty comes to her
role with veritably no acting ex-
perience at all. Hays portrays the
World War II fighter pilot Ted
Striker, who boards the plane on
which his stewardess-lover
Elaine, portrayed by Hagerty, is
working. He ends up piloting the
plane after a mysterious sickness
afflicts the entire flight crew.

Landing takes place only after
we witness suicides of passengers
listening to Striker’s life story, a

a pilot who makes a homosexual
pass to a young boy (Rossie Har-
ris) while his wife (Barbara
Stuart) is sleeping with a horse
and a plethora of other predic-
aments which leave the audience
in stitches.

In fact, there is barely a spot in

the movie which is not a parody
of something, and so much is
packed into the show that many
funny lines are overlooked or
simply lost in the shufrle. This
haphazard situation is by no
means ideal, but it is tolerable.
Another problem with the film
is that the scenes outside of the
main plot taking place inside the
airplane or control tower —
especially Striker’s life story —

are quite dull, and the vague at-
tempts at humor in these seg-
ments seem rather contrived.
But maybe that is part of the
writer’s aim.

Airplane! is by no means
perfect. The slow spots and
overabundance of parody mar its
polish, but still it remains an in-
credibly well done comedy and
quite a good show, well worth see-
ing.

Union Station opens in town:

‘Quality food for low prices’

By TODDG. BUCHHOLZ

For those who are tired of the
same old choice between ham-
burgers and pizza, the Union Sta-
tion restaurant on Market Street
brings refreshing variety to
Lewisburg dining.

Two weeks old, the Union Sta-
tion serves tacos, burritos, subs
and roast beef sandwiches in an
informal setting. The decor uses
a train motif, with counters
resembling ticket booths and

menus hung like railroad
schedules.

Generous portions of fresh
roast beef can be found on the
“Chicago Express Line.” Served
on a toasted sesame bun, the
Beefer ($1.59) and its variations
— the Cheefer ($1.69, with
cheese), the Leefer ($1.69, with
lettuce, tomato and onion), and
the Cleefer ($1.74, with cheese,
lettuce, tomato and onion) —
make filling and tasty meals that

are well worth the money.

On the ‘Tijuana Line,” the
tacos are spicy and juicy. Pep-
pers, tomato, onion, burger meat,
lettuce and special sauce pro-
vide a fine filling in a crunchy
shell. Although one taco does not
provide a full meal, the 63 cent
price makes it reasonable.

Burritos are also on the Ti-
juana schedule. The ingredients
are similar to those of the tacos
but lacking the bite of the taco
sauce. They are served in a soft,
thin shell; some may identify
them as Mexican egg rolls. The
burrito is also not enough for a
meal and the 99-cent price,
although low, is less reasonable
than that of the tacos. The taco is
recommended for those with
more spirited taste buds as well
as more limited budgets.

There is also a garden burrito
offered that is made with
vegetables instead of the usual
chopped beef.

A wide variety of subs is of-
fered on the ‘‘Long Island Ex-
press” ranging from simple
cheese ($1.49) through mixed
meats ($1.99) to hot roast beef
($2.99). Their substantial size and
the quality of their fillings make
them good bets for the hungry but
financially disadvantaged col-
lege student.

Union Station has generated no
animosity between the two.

“We're very friendly with
George, Tony and Gus. We tell
the people they can bring their
pizzas in here to eat if one of them
wants a taco,” Breed explained.
“All we ask is that they buy their
drinks in here.’’ A conversation
with ‘“Za’s’” owners confirmed
Breed’s neighborly statements.

“So far,” Breed continued,
“business and support from the
community have exceeded all of
our expectations.”

Union Station makes fast-food
dining enjoyable while keeping
prices within range of even the
most empty of wallets. There is
quite a bit of expansion planned.
One hopes that quality of the
food served will remain the
same, and Union Station will
become a permanent Market

nellians and Lewisburgers alike
will be able to obtain good, af-
fordable meals.

folk festival in the spring, student art ex- ©

hibits, poetry readings, concerts and criti-
que sessions of various artistic events tak-
ing place on campus.

Another goal of the creative arts house is ¢

to host members of the newly reorganized
Performing Arts Series in a number of in-
formal group discussions and open rehear-
sals.

Weiland believes that such events will
enable students to meet prominent artists
on a more personal level than is normally
available. The first of these happenings oc-
curs at 1:15 p.m. Sunday, with an open
rehearsal of the visiting Fitzwilliam String
Quartet.

Aside from planned activities, the
creative arts house residents hope that
their building will serve as an artistic
watering-hole where impromptu jam ses-
sions can occur more freely than in the at-
mosphere of the average dormitory.

Soccer seeks extra effort for a winning season

By ARTHUR BROCKWAY

The soccer team returns for its
1980 season with an experienced
look and a solid lineup, with only
two questions looming large for
Coach Craig Reynolds’ charges.

The first is a familiar one and
the second more fundamental.
Who will fill the goalie slot? Can
they win the close match?

Reviewing last season, a 6-7-1
effort, Reynolds recalls, “We
were in a lot of close games.
Often, there was just a failure to
take advantage of opponents’
mistakes.” The coach’s words of
frustration ring true as last fall’s
campaign witnessed the booters
losing all but one of its games by
a single goal.

Reynolds also cites the
toughest week of the season,
when the Bisons threw a scare in-
to national semifinalist Penn
State before succumbing 2-1, and
then travelled to Rider, losing 3-2
in overtime.

Bucknell went into the week
5-2, and went into a tailspin, not
winning again until the final

game of the season against
Lehigh.

The problem of finding a con-
sistent goalkeeper has been
around for the last three years.
Senior Pete Puccia and junior
Paul Green have been in a cons-
tant battle for the netminder’s
rights, and two years ago alter-
nated halves the whole season.
Last year Puccia won the start-
ing honors halfway through the
season, but not until Green had
played three full games.

Reynolds is again faced with a
decision. ‘‘Green has improved
over the summer,” he com-
mented of the former high school
all-stater from New Jersey. “It
will just be a matter of who clicks
better with the backs.”

The final assignment will prob-
ably not come until somewhere in
the middle of the season, with the
keepers once again alternating
games until then.

Reynolds is particularly ex-
cited about his forward line.
Returning to the attack will be
juniors Brian Hassinger and Pat

AFC forecast: no surprises

By BOB DAVIS and
JEFF CROSS

With the 1980 National Football
League season already one week
old, we will lay our necks on the
line by predicting both the
regular and post-season out-
comes of the 16-week schedule,
beginning with this week’s play
by play of the AFC.

AFC EAST

A question mark in New
England is whether the aging
defense can hold the leads the of-
fense should provide. Steve
Grogan, one of the most mobile
quarterbacks in the game, will
call his own plays and throw often
to clutch tight end Russ Francis
and big-play receiver Harold
Jackson as the Patriots march to
the divisional title.

Don Shula’s well prepared
Miami Dolphins should challenge
New England for the top spot.
With a solid young defense and a
potentially explosive offense led
by deep threats Freddie Soloman
and Nat Moore plus flashy runner
Delvin Williams, the Dolphins
will be a definite playoff con-
tender.

The New York Jets’ problem is
whether the defense can hold the
opposition to under 30 points per
game. With the addition of rookie
speedster Johnny “Lam” Jones,
the Jets’ already potent offense
can only get better.

A healthy Bert Jones is the key
to a successful season in
Baltimore. All purpose runner
Joe Washington and rookie Curtis
Dickey give the Colts a respec-
table running game.

When O.J. Simpson left for the
sunny skies of California, Buffalo
imported former Los Angeles
coach Chuck Knox to brighten the
Bills’ fortunes. But don’t look for
them in the playoffs this year.

AFC CENTRAL
The four-time Super Bowl
champion Pittsburgh Steelers
have more talent than they can
use. Joe Greene says ‘‘One for the
thumb in ’81.”’ We’ll be surprised
if he’s wrong.

In any other division, Bum
Phillips’ Houston Oilers would be
odds-on favorites for the crown.

them without a prayer.

AFC WEST

The only time San Diego puts

the ball on the ground is between

plays. The addition of John Cap-
pelletti could help give the
Chargers a running attack to
match the aerial barrage of Dan
Fouts and company. The Charg-
ers quality defense will enable
them to repeat as division
champs.

The Denver Broncos have final-
ly found a replacement for aged
quarterback Craig Morton in ex-
Jet Matt Robinson. The ‘Orange
Crush”’ defense will keep Denver
in the race.

Seattle faces one of the
toughest schedules in the NFL,

Steve Diorio

making their playoff chances
slim. The combination of Steve
Zorn to Steve Largent continues
to be the brightest aspect of the
Seahawks’ offense.

Owner Al Davis needs more
than a move to Los Angeles anda
new quarterback in Dan
Pastorini to rejuvenate his
Oakland Raiders.

Kansas City could surprise
some people in 1980, but don’t
hold your breath for the Chiefs.

Finally, look for Pittsburgh and
Houston to meet for the AFC
championship with the familiar
result.

Golfers have balance, talent

By DAVE KIRKPATRICK

Led by senior co-captains Dave
Richards and Rob Wagner,
Coach Jeff Ranck’s varsity golf
team will open its fall 1980 season
tomorrow at the West Point In-
vitational tournament. The
Bisons posted a 5-1 dual meet
record last spring and finished
fourth in the East Coast Con-
ference tournament.

One of the keys to last season’s
success was Richards, who
established himself as one of the
finest collegiate golfers in the
East while posting the second
best season average in Bucknell
golf history. This summer, he
continued his fine play by qualify-
ing for the prestigious Northeast
Amateur and Eastern Amateur
tournaments.

Wagner is also coming off a
solid season. His continued im-
provement and leadership will
benefit the Bisons.

Rick Kramer ’83, who came to
Bucknell last year as one of the
most highly touted players in the
school’s history, is expected to
contribute greatly. The former
Pennsylvania high school golf
champion got off to a slow start
last year but seems to be making

the adjustment to the college
game.

Returning lettermen on the
deep roster are juniors Kevin
High, Mike Stoyla and Rob
McFarland as well as
sophomores Bill Frances and
Corey Temple.

Absent from the Bucknell
lineup are junior regulars Jeff
Buley and Kevin Forrest who are
spending the semester abroad.

Peter Orr, Todd Rankin, Bill
Hagan and Michael Stelljes are
promising freshmen from an
outstanding recruiting season.

Ranck is optimistic about Bison
fortunes, stating that ‘the team
has good balance and outstanding
talent.”

Increased major tournament
exposure will benefit the Bisons
in their quest for another winning

Field hockey outlook is bright

By BILL BURKE

The varsity field hockey team
opened its 1980 season yesterday
and was dealt a 6-0 defeat by
powerful Penn State at State
College. The Bisons played a
respectable game against the
Lions, who are ranked second
nationally in Division I. “We
worked well as a unit,’ com-
mented co-captain Anne Kennedy
g2, “but it was like playing
against professionals.”

Coming off a 10-5-2 season and
a seventh rank nationally in Divi-
sion II, the varsity field hockey
team has a tough act to follow,
but Coach Sally Starr feels the

Bisons have the potential to finish
even higher.

In last weekend’s pre-season
tournament at Franklin and Mar-
shall College, the squad played
competitively against Division I
powers Penn, Temple and Lock
Haven, as well as a tough
Franklin and Marshall team.

Starr stated that the team will
be very young, having lost five
starters to graduation. Starr
stressed that ‘‘a lot depends on
how fast the players mature
against tough competition.”

Four members of a strong

freshman class will be in the star-
ting lineup. Nancy Dill, Sue

Lenker and Becky Bittinger have
earned forward spots while Nan-
cy Williams will help to anchor
the defense.

“The defense should be very
strong,” according to Starr. Se-
cond year starter Betsy Doyle ’82
is in goal, with Jill Henry, the
loan senior starter, at sweeper.
Henry and Doyle were standouts
on the varsity softball team last
spring.

The starting midfielders are
Kennedy and Jeanne Minahan
83.

Starr feels that ‘“‘the players
are strong but it is necessary that
they jell as ateam.”

Bisons set for opener at UConn

FOOTBALL, from page 24

up both positions is the versatile
Marty Schaetzle ’83.

Anchoring the Bison offensive
line is senior center Scott Taylor,
who for the last two years backed
up ECAC I-AA all-star Jim
Tomeo.

The only returning starter in
the offensive backfield is left
halfback Kenny Jenkins ’82 who
led the team in rushing and scor-
ing last season. ‘“‘He’s a better
ball player than he was last
year,” stated Curtis, ‘‘and I look
for him to rush for 1500 total of-
fensive yards.”

Paired with Jenkins in the
backfield is converted fullback
Marshall Hall ’83, a good blocker
who is “making the transition
well.”

Filling the slot at fullback is
Geoff Gallo ’82, ‘‘who is quick and
hits the hole well.” Gallo should
be effective in short yardage
situations. Daryl Cline ’83 and
Larry D’Amico ’81 provide depth
at the position.

Calling the signals for the Herd
this year will be sophomore
quarterback Al Locey, whose big-
gest asset is his emotional con-
trol. ‘‘Locey can run well and he’s
very cool under pressure,” com-
mented Curtis.

The Bisons will have to effec-
tively execute the big play in
order to have a successful cam-
paign. A margin of just six points
separated Bucknell from an 8-2
record last season.

Curtis noted, ‘‘We have to pass
more effectively and more often,

but we must still maintain a
steady running attack to main-
tain ball control.”

The Bisons open their season
tomorrow as they travel to the
University of Connecticut for the
first-ever meeting with the
Huskies.

UConn finished 3-6-2 in 1979 but
boasts ten returning starters on
offense and eight on defense. The
Huskies opened their 1980 season
with a 20-10 victory at New
Hampshire last weekend.

Against common opponents
last season, both schools were
defeated by Rutgers; UConn los-
ing by 12 points and Bucknell by
two. UConn lost to Boston Univer-
sity 16-12 while the Bisons tied the
playoff-bound Terriers 20-20 in
the season finale at Memorial
Stadium.

Bison offense young; |
defense experienced

By STEVEN SKOLNICK
and MICHAEL SUAREZ
It’s a large wooden board with
moveable name cards and it
hangs on a wall in Head Coach
Bob Curtis’ office. It’s the Bison
football depth chart and, as daily
line-up changes are recorded, the
status of the team can be seen at
a glance.

The Herd is all here — the
starters, the stars, the promising,
the unknown and at the bottom of
the board, the injured. The suc-
cess of the Bisons will be
measured by how many of those
placards are able to remain at
the top and how ably those in the
middle can fill in should anyone
fall to the bottom.

In short, the Orange and Blue
are big on talent and short on
depth.

The Bisons faced a similar
situation last season on the way
to a frustrating 4-4-2 record. The
Herd got off to a strong 3-1-1 start
highlighted by a two-point loss to
powerful Rutgers, an un-
precedented victory over Cornell,
and a shutout streak of 14 con-
secutive quarters.

But when a series of injuries
besieged the Herd in midseason,
lack of depth left them able to win
only one of their remaining five
games.

The Bison defense is a modified
4-4 which frequently shifts, mak-
ing an opponent’s blocking

assignments more difficult to ex-
ecute. Both the front four and the
linebackers key well against the
run, while an experienced: secon-
dary should limit the success of
their opponent’s passing attack.

Curtis commented, ‘‘The
defense can be a good one but I’m
afraid of an injury to this unit at
any position.”

Heading up the defensive front
are returning senior starters
Bruce Keltie, Dave Mann, Pete
Mauritz and Dave Hibbard. Tri-
captains Hibbard and Keltie are
among the most experienced
players on the team and will pro-
vide an unparalleled combination
at the defensive end positions.

Although the defensive line is
one of the most talented areas of
the team, the availability of ex-
perienced back-up personnel is
“very, very Sparse,” according
to Curtis.

Starting at the middle line-
backer positions are veterans
Alvin Depew ’81 and Pat Paro ’82.
Returning as the strong side
linebacker is tri-captain Joe
Catalano ’81.

Playing opposite him on the
weak side will be Jeff Miller ’82.
Mike Knaub ’82 is returning
following an injury last year to
provide a strong backup at
linebacker.

Despite the recent loss to injury

Ken Jenkins ‘82 displays the form that earned him

ECAC division I-AA rookie of the

week honors in the 1979 home opener against Dayton. Jenkins is expected to be the
Bison's offensive workhorse this season.

’81, the defensive secondary re-
mains one of the most capable
areas on the team. Returning
with valuable starting experience
are safety Jim Gush ’81 and
backs McKinley Norris ’81 and
Doug Smoot ’82.

On offense, the Herd will con-
tinue to run its attack out of the
versatile Wing-T formation. Cur-
tis believes this formation both
“maximizes ball control’? and
“reduces mistakes.”

Lots of motion in the backfield
should give opposing linebackers
plenty of trouble. Look for a
strong option to the right, quick
misdirection plays and a more
potent aerial attack.

Harriers aiming for record sixth title

By JEFF CROSS

Coming off two consecutive
17th place finishes in the NCAA
national championships, the
men’s varsity cross country team
expects another outstanding
season. Coach Art Gulden’s har-
riers are favored to win a record
sixth straight East Coast Con-
ference title, but will face strong
challenges from St. Joseph’s and
Lehigh.

The squad also seeks to retain
one of five NCAA qualifying
berths from the eastern region as
they shoot to improve on their
17th ranking nationally.

Bucknell will put its 65-meet
undefeated streak on the line
tomorrow in a season-opening
home meet against a strong Col-
umbia squad.

calling the Lions ‘one of the
seven best teams in the East.”

Last year, Columbia won the
Heptagonal championships,
outracing all of the Ivy League
universities as well as Army and
Navy.

With six of the top seven run-
ners returning and a strong
freshman group, the Bisons will
have depth once again. Leading
the squad are tri-captains Jim
O’Shea ’81, Mike Debraggio ’81
and Rick Sayre "82.

O’Shea, noting that ‘‘there are
about ten runners within the
same ability category,” predicts
a higher finish than last year.
Sayre feels that Bucknell’s early
season training has gone very
well and adds, “‘the squad is aim-
ing for top ten in the NCAA’s.”

Despite relatively poor times
by the more experienced varsity
runners in a recent 5,000 meter
time trial, Gulden cautions that
the race was not a determinant of
standings on the varsity squad.
The coach attributes the disap-
pointing times toa “Jack of incen-
tive,” but added that juniors
Steve Bigotto and Doug Pickell,
as well as most of the freshman
runners, nonetheless turned in
strong performances.

Sayre reassures that Bucknell
will be well prepared to race
against Columbia on its way to
another banner campaign.

For the first time in recent
memory the Bisons have a core of
fine receivers. Heading up the list
is tight end Rich Passerotti ’82
who last year was converted
from a linebacking spot.
Passerotti surprised his doctors
and coaches by coming back
from serious knee surgery in the
spring. Although few thought he
would see action this season, Cur-
tis claims ‘‘he’s 100 percent right
now.”

In a move that surprised many
people, the Bucknell coaching
staff has named a freshman,
Dave Kucera, as the starting split
end.

“It’s a big adjustment for a
freshman to step onto the varsity
field but we feel the ability is
there,” commented Curtis.
Kucera’s speed and excellent
hands give the Bisons a genuine
deep threat.

Added strength will be gained
on the right side of the offensive
line by the return of starting
tackle Mike McDonald ’80 who
was granted an additional year of
eligibility because he missed the
1978 season with a fractured leg.
McDonald is big, strong and has
the capability to play tight end,
giving Bucknell the option to use
a double tight end offense in
short-yardage situations.

Splitting left tackle duties will
be juniors John Boehmer and Joe
Golomboski.

The senior tandem of Al
Wehrhahn and Darren Ford will
lead the way for Bison runners at
right and left guard, respective-
ly.

“Wehrhahn is as capable as
any guard we’ve had in the
Wing-T,” commented Curtis.
Returning starter Ford has been
described by Curtis as ‘‘a fine
blocker on the move.” Backing

Solar club builds

aquaculture at mod

By KEN WOLCKENHAUER

Aquaculture, a science being
pioneered by the Solar Club, will
soon be producing high protein
fish and vegetable fertilizers ina
University modular unit.

The solar mod, with its attached
greenhouse, waS the location
chosen by the club to build a six
foot deep aquarium-type pond
which can serve as a controlled
breeding environment for some
250 fish totally free from
chemical fertilizers, electrical
power, and live feed.

Bob Doms ’81, one of the
primary builders, is doing his
senior honor thesis with informa-
tion he collects from the project.
He cited four functions of the
aquaculture project: 1) low cost
food production; 2) utilizing
nutrients from the water in the
pond for plants; 3) storing heat
collected during the day for room
temperature control; and 4)
aesthetic pleasure of the
greenhouse.

“The aquaculture system,”
said ABS President John
Dzurinko, ’81, “was designed in
the same light as was the entire
solar mod project—to provide an
example of how food can be
grownina small area.”

He said the process actually
models an entire ecosystem in a
simple way, virtually unaffected
by anything in the outside en-
vironment except the energized
rays of the sun.

Dzurinko also stressed the size
and simplicity of the experiment.
Although technology: will soon be
able to improve the model, this
project demonstrates a ‘real life
experience”’ for people to see a
home where energy and food
could be produced to sustain
itself.

The costs of the project, ac-
cording to Doms, were “about
$500 to build, not including the
hundred hours or so of labor that
went into it.”

The University policy on
alcohol consumption is similar
to regulations in effect at a
central Connecticut college.
Page7

Fraternities which are private-
ly owned are exempt from these
rules.

Ina clarification of the Univer-
sity’s policy on alcoholic
beverages, Dean of Students Af-
fairs John Dunlop explained in an
administrative notice that ‘‘ex-
cept at special events sanctioned
by the University, serving or con-
suming alcoholic beverages is
prohibited in non-residential
University ouildings, in the main
public rooms or similar common
areas of residential facilities, and
out-of-doors on campus.”

This qualification which ex-
empts events “sanctioned by the
University” from this rule is the
loophole through which beer is
permitted to be served at the an-
nual graduation tent party.

Greek Week is not a “Universi-
ty sanctioned” event, Commer-
ford said, and alcoholic consump-
tion is therefore restricted to the
properties of privately owned
fraternities.

It is unclear how severely per-
sons who violate this policy will
be dealt with. Commerford said
“There’s little we can do but to
remind students that they are
breaking the law.”

“Enforcement is still in the
hands of local police for out of
doors on the campus,” he said.

The University’s stricter en-
forcement of its alcoholic con-
sumption policy is seen as an ef-
fort to promote responsible drink-
ing while limiting its liability.

The adaption of this policy is in

art a direct consequence of a
1979, $1.4 million liability suit fil-
ed against the Delaware Valley
College of Pennsylvania, ac-
cording to Commerford.

Delaware Valley was found
negligent and liable in the injury
and subsequent quadraplegic
paralysis of a student which oc-
cured after a school-sponsored
picnic.

This court decision prompted
many Pennsylvania colleges, in-
cluding Bucknell, to reassess
their student drinking policies,
Commerford said.

“The University wishes to
minimize the likelihood of serious
liability for its employees and
itself as an institution,” ac-
cording to Dunlop. “We cannot

O’Brien subject of trustee’s
inquiry after four years here

By DAVID HAWKINGS

At the request of University
President Dennis O’Brien, an ad
hoc committee of the Universi-
ty’s board of trustees this year
will conduct a “review and
assessment” of O’Brien’s first
five years here.

The trustees’ Committee on
Presidential Assessment has
already begun work on the report
they will deliver to the biannual
meeting of the board here next
May.

Samuel H. Woolley, vice chair-
man of the board and chairman
of the assessment, said ‘“‘Nobody
on the board has any concerns
about O’Brien” when reached for
comment Thursday night.

O’Brien — who will be the first
of Bucknell’s 12 presidents to
undergo a formal evaluation —
asked when he was appointed
president in 1976 that a report on
his job performance be issued at
the end of his fifth year. He

A revamping of the phone system here will mak

reiterated this request at the
board’s meeting last spring.

Woolley said the committee has
had but one preliminary meeting
and that no format for the evalua-
tion had yet been set.

“We don’t know yet what we
will be looking for,” he said, add-
ing that he ‘‘guessed”’ part of the
report would include interviews
with members of the student
body, faculty and administration.
A progress report is scheduled to
be delivered to the board’s ex-
ecutive committee in March.

O’Brien said this week that
reviews of the type he asked for
when accepted the job of presi-
dent are a ‘healthy way of
strengthening the office.”

He said he had ‘‘no idea” of
what form the trustee’s in-
vestigation would take.

College president assessments
of this type — which have become
common elsewhere recently —
are an offspring of increased

“concern about executive ac-
countability,’’ O’Brien said.

The president is directly ac-
countable only to the board of
trustees, and serves ‘‘at their
pleasure,’ University policy
states.

O’Brien said he was not wor-
ried the committee would give
the board an unfavorable “‘report
card,” and he said he plans to ask
for another assessment in 1986,
the year he would enter his 10th
year here.

He said he has ‘“‘no plans”’ to
retire.

Besides Woolley, the four-
member group appointed by
trustee Chairman Charles Baird
in May consists of Andrew
Mathieson of Pittsburgh, Claire
Carlson of New York City and
Uiversity of Chicago English Pro-
fessor Robert Streeter.

None of the trustees has ever
served on a presidential assess-
ment committee before, Woolley
said.

Tom Travis, professor of political science, speaks Thursday
night in the University Center forum on the Israeli
Palestinian conflict and on other Middle East problems.

Travis says Palestine
key to Mideast peace

By STEVE GARFINKEL

A Palestinian nation must have statehood and self-determination
to achieve lasting peace in the Middle East, Associate Professor of
Political Science Tom Travis told a meeting of the International
Relations club in the University Center Forum Thursday night.

Travis depicted in detail two scenarios — one “ static’ and one
“dynamic” — that portrayed the future of the Mideast.

The static scenario would be one in which Egyptian President An-
war Sadat would be snared in ‘‘an Israeli trap” that confines him to
waiting at the feet of the Israelis.

‘Anwar Sadat has a tremendous ego and he wants all of the Sinai
Peninsula back. If he threatens Israel, he won’t reach his goal,
Travis said. Sadat, according to Travis, would probably be ousted
as Egypt’s leader by the military without taking this stance.

The dynamic scenario detailed the coexistence of a Palestinian
state with Israel by the election of labor leaders who would replace
the “‘hard line” government of Israel.

A five-year period would exist during which time a Palestinian
state would be “‘tried out” by Israel, in Travis’ plan. This dynamic
situation would result in a strong Israeli-Egyptian peace, the
reaching of United States goals and — most importantly — no war
in the Mideast, Travis said.

“Both Sadat and the United States must choose,”’ he said, bet-
ween which approach is right to take. A new war would include the
possible use of nuclear weapons, the failure of U.S. diplomacy and
a possible split in the NATO alliance, according to Travis.

Travis listed six reasons for the ‘‘limited” Israeli position in the
Palestinian matter. Because of violence, he said, many Palesti-
nians are unwilling to negotiate with the Israelis. Jordan and Syria
still do not condone the Camp David Accords, and as a result,
Egypt is ostracized in the world.

Travis said the Palestinian quest for statehood has been
legitimized by the recent UN condemnation of Israel. The Euro-
pean Common Market has also taken a stance on a ‘“‘new European
initiative” to restart the stalled peace talks, Travis told the au-
dience of 30.

system which serves the University, is expected to
have the new equipment needed to complete this
change sometime this fall.

At present, University switchboard operators
cannot determine from which room a call is being
placed. Billing students for toll calls would
therefore be an “uncontrollable situation’? ac-
cording to John Zeller, vice president for ad-
ministration and finance.

The U.S.-Israeli stance has united the Arab nations more than
before against Israel, he concluded.

Travis listed five ‘conditions of stability” that would not allow a
“super conflict” to occur in the Mideast. The United Nations en-
forcement action to back up its resolutions against Israel, Travis
said, is not likely to occur. He added that America‘ts unlikely to
press Israel to give concessions to the Palestine Liberation
Organization because Israel isa U.S. ally.

campus calls without going through the University
switchboard.

Security measures may be necessary to prevent
unauthorized use of the phones for long distance
calls. Locks may be installed on the phones, requir-
ing students to unlock the phone before use.

Phone bills would be issued separately through
the University and sent to each room.

Student leaders convene for a ‘Round Table’ talk

By DAVID HAWKINGS

ABS President John Dzurinko ’81 this
week called together the leaders of major
student organizations in an effort to “‘coor-
dinate and consolidate’ their efforts
behind the major goals of his administra-
tion.

In what Dzurinko termed a “‘roundtable
discussion” Tuesday evening, the ABS’
principal officer told the others “We have
the resources and the knowledge behind
us, but we’re letting them escape.”

““When we're isolated from each others
as leaders, we're defeating ourselves,”
Dzurinko said. ‘If we know we can go to
each other for support and help, we can get

things done.”

The seven others attending the dinner
meeting appeared responsive to
Dzurinko’s urging that the efforts of the
major extracurricular activities be
strengthened through unity, but they all
balked at the president’s suggestion that
major extracurricular efforts — especially
if they improved the life of the surrounding
community of Lewisburg — be more easily
rewarded by academic course credit.

Although WVBU-FM Program Director
Jay Cresswell ’81 asserted that ‘If we all
had course credit for the time we put in on
activities, we would all have graduated
years ago,” he joined with the others in

telling Dzurinko that efforts outside the
classroom should be separated from
academic endeavors in most situations.

Others who participated in the meeting
were Bucknell Student Lectureship Chair-
man and former ABS President Phil An-
drews 81, Bucknell Engineer Editor David
Christiansen °81, Concern and Action
President Steve Hushner ’82, Interfrater-
nity Council President Steve Kohn ’81 Eco-
Coalition Chairman Scott Bolhack 81 and
an editorial board member of the
Bucknellian.

One of Dzurinko’s primary goals as
president of the ABS is to develop what he
calls ‘‘a more socially oriented cur-

riculum” for the University, and he tried
to sell his ideas to the group at the
meeting.

There was a general consensus among
the seven others in attendance that faculty
should be encouraged to offer courses
which integrated material with the needs
of the community.

Dzurinko plans to convene the group
weekly for an indefinite period of time, but
he said he plans to invite other student
leaders — from groups such as the Black
Student Alliance, the Women’s Concern
Group, the Panhellenic Council and the
three principal religious organizations
here — to all future meetings.

Thomas:

By MATT KARANIAN
‘where the hell is Bucknell? ie
It’s an overused phrase, but it

was probably the first reaction of
Linda Thomas, visiting assistant
instructor of political science,
when she responded to a Univer-
sity advertisement for a position
here.

Thomas is filling a vacancy in
the comparative politics division
of the political science depart-
ment. The temporary opening
was created when Professor
Harry Blair left on sabbatical
last semester.

Last year, the position of
visiting professor was filled by
Stuart Rothenberg, an interna-
tional politics specialist. His one
year contract with the University

rolled in squash, swimming and
dance classes, and before school
began, she ran daily. ‘‘Now
there’s no time,’ she says
laconically.

Thomas does not consider
herself ‘‘politically active,”
however. ‘Many have the im-
pression that I’m a Radical Black
Nationalist, but this is not the
case,” she said. “Tm not an
ideological person’.” Thomas
said even her friends ‘“‘can’t tell
you what my leanings are.”

She isn’t sure who she will sup-
port for president yet, and she
was unsure how to label herself
politically. ‘“‘Who says political
science professors should be
ideologically anything?”

Claims have been made in the
past—including an assertion last

expired last May.

NEWSMAKERS

Thomas’ agreement calls for
her to serve here for two years.

Thomas said she “had never
heard of Bucknell” before apply-
ing here. Upon checking the
University’s credentials,
however, she said she found it to
bea ‘“‘very good school.””

But, because ‘‘this is the East,
not the South,’’ she has ex-
perienced ‘‘a little cultural
shock,” and is only “vaguely
looking forward to living in a
small town.”

Thomas, who grew up in Loui-
siana, said she has never been
this far east before. And although
her hometown was small, it was
only 15 miles outside Baton
Rouge, giving her the advantage
of living in both a small town and
being near a city.

Everything cultural here, she
said, seems to revolve around the
University.

Thomas considers herself
somewhat ‘‘athletically in-
clined,” and active. She is en-

year by Rothenberg—that the
political science department here
is leftist. The department has
been called unbalanced
ideologically, and has been refer-
red to as composed of “collec-
tivists.”

Thomas shrugs off these
claims, however. “At Bucknell,
anybody is leftist. Center here is
not the normal center.” For
Bucknell, the ideological center
is actually far to the right, she
said.

While refusing to explain where
she stood ideologically, she said
that either extreme, whether
rightist or leftist, is a reflection of
narrow-mindedness. Rightists
and leftists are usually “not will
ing to deal with opinions opposite
to theirs.”

Drawing her conclusion from
dealings with reporters last
semester, Thomas said she
believed the Bucknellian is an
ultra-conservative newspaper.
She said she had vowed never to

deal with it again, but broke her
promise to herself this week.

Having been reared in the
South, however, Thomas said her
first exposures to conservatives,
and ‘her first impressions of
them, are men in ‘‘white robes”
and burning crosses. But
although she equates conser-
vatism with the racism of the Ku
Klux Klan in the South, she
claims that the conservatives in
the northern United States are
such mainly because of their
socio-economic background.

Thomas said conservatism
among students was primarily a
product of their predominantly
upper-middle class upbringing.
She said she has encountered no
racism or sexism. Thomas is the
first black woman on the faculty
here, and is the only woman in
her department.

Thomas arrived at Bucknell
having received a lot of unwanted
publicity. The competition to fill
sabbatical-bound Blair’s vacancy
in the department was intense,
and Rothenberg was among those
competing with Thomas.

Rothenberg claimed he was the
only member of the political
science department with a con-
servative ideology, and he
therefore should be retained. His
one year position had expired and
was considered for renewal.

When the position was offered
to Thomas, Rothenberg told the
Bucknellian, ‘‘Although Thomas
is a qualified candidate, there isa
reasonable chance she (would not
have been hired) had she not
beena black woman.”

Thomas doesn’t think Rothen-
berg is correct.

“7 am well qualified. I fit the
bill for the job: comparative
politics.” She said her applica-
tion never mentioned she was a
black woman, because she
“didn’t want it to.””

She said last year’s Rothenberg
controversy, in which students
wrote letters and circulated peti-
tions to persuade the University
to hire him, is ‘‘a problem for the
University, not for me.”

Although Thomas said
“Rothenberg might not have had
a case if I wasn’t a black
woman,” she has “‘no feelings”
about what has passed.

she only wants to expose students

one’s self you have to know where

Thomas would like to conduct

Polls show Carter and
Reagan in close contest

By MARY LISA MURGIANO
According to a Washington
Post poll conducted Sept. 3-7,
Ronald Reagan and Jimmy
Carter each would have received
37 percent of the votes and John
Anderson would have received 13

CAMPAIGN
UPDATE

percent of the votes, it the
presidential election were held
that week.

In view of these close stand-
ings, Carter and Reagan have
been involved in heated debates
while campaigning.

In Houston, Carter accused
Reagan of being sheltered by ad-
visors in an effort to avoid further
gaffes or blunders on the trail.

Reagan shot back at Carter
when he and runningmate
George Bush gathered for a rally
on the Capitol steps with
Republican Congressional can-
didates and party leaders Mon-
day.

Reagan criticized the disunity
of President Carter and his party
and went on to outline some ma-
jor Republican goals at the rally.
Among them were tax cuts,
government spending cuts and
stepped-up military efforts.

“The promises of four years
ago lie shattered. The dreams are
betrayed,” Reagan said.

Meanwhile, independent can-
didate Anderson launched an at-
tack on Carter while campaign-
ing in Oregon. Anderson criti-

cized Carter’s record concerning
women’s. rights and human
rights.

He called the administration’s
efforts on women’s rights “‘half
hearted” and condemned the
president’s position of seating the
ousted Pol Pot regime of Cam-
bodia in the United Nations as
contrary to previous human
rights policies.

Anderson also blasted
Reagan’s stand on women’s
rights issues and criticized the
Republican platform for its sup-
port of a Constitutional amend-
ment banning abortion. Anderson
also said Reagan should direct at-
tention to other problems such as
child care and domestic violence
so that the Republican party
could truly call itself ‘‘profami-
ly.”
Both Reagan and Anderson
criticized Carter for his refusal to
debate with them, but Carter
termed it ‘‘a Republican debate”
and restated that he would not be
there. The president is willing to
debate with Reagan but declined
to participate in a session that in-
cluded Anderson.

The debate, sponsored by the
League of Women Voters, takes
place in Baltimore and will begin
at 10 p.m. Sunday. It will be
televised by the CBS and NBC
networks and will focus on
domestic affairs, including the
economy and national defense.

According to Harriet Hentges,
executive director of the League,
the setting will include a chair for
Carter, presumably as a
reminder of his absence.

in terms of BTU’s in heat energy and edible food

The primary fish being bred is the tilapia, a Mid-
Eastern fish known for its strong health and hear-
tiness as well as easy breeding qualities.

Other benefits of the tilapia, which grows to be
seven to twelve inches, are that it eats algae and
does not eat any other fish, most importantly its
young. In the two months of the experiment, not one
of the fish has died, and 35 have grown to full
adulthood.

The technology for the project came from various
sources, especially the acquired knowledge and
research of the seven people who composed the
team of builders. Many ideas came from an
organization in Cape Cod, Mass. called the New
Alchemists. This group is a progressive research
group in the area of solar, wind and aqua
technology.

designed to produce and stimulate the growth of
large quantities of algae which is the primary
source of food for the fish. Much of the waste and
other undesirable materials settle to the bottom and

Campus-wide elections to be held Tuesday ;

low voter turnout here

University students go to the polls Tuesday to vote
for living unit representatives to the ABS Congress,
hosts and hostesses for Homecoming and officers
for the Class of 1984.

Voting tables will be open in the uphill and
downhill lobbies of the University Center from 9
a.m. to 6 p.m. Results of the voting will be announc-
ed outside the ABS offices on the ground floor of the
UC at 11 p.m. that night, according to ABS Presi-
dent John Dzurinko 81.

Freshmen will be electing a president, vice presi-
dent.and secretary/treasurer to organize the class.
The winner of the three-way race for president will
also sit as a voting member of the ABS Congress.

First-year students here traditionally have the
highest percentage of voter turnout. More than half

is expected to recur

of the Class of 1983 voted last year.

Upperclassmen have a far lower turnout percen-
tage. Last year, less than 15 percent voted for ABS
Steering Committee positions.

Somoza cut-down
by machine gun fire

Anastasio Somoza Debayle, the
ousted ruler of Nicaragua, died in
a hail of machine-gun fire
Wednesday in Asuncion, the
capital of Paraguay.

Somoza chose Paraguay as a
safe place of exile last year.

The 54-year-old Nicaraguan,
whose family ruled his Central
American nation from 1936 until
he fled Sandinist guerrilla forces
in July of last year, was struck by
25 machine-gun bullets.

The five man Nicaraguan junta
who presently rule the country
deny having any association with
Somoza’s death. They never-
theless expressed joy at the news
of his death.

The United States supported
Somoza’s dictatorship, and he in
turn acted as an American
“proconsul” in Central America,
interfering openly in the affairs
of his neighbors to keep them op-
posed to Communism. Somoza
was therefore puzzled when the
Carter administration criticized
violations of human rights in
Nicaragua.

Left-wing politicians hailed the
assassination as a warning to all
dictators.

His assassination, however,
may not end the Somoza fiefdom.
His son is said to be eager to
avenge the dynasty’s collapse.

Saudis up oil prices
to keep OPEC unity

Saudi Arabia, the World’s
largest oil exporter; agreed to
raise its oil price by $2 a barrel;
to $30, yesterday.

Saudi Arabia’s deputy oil
minister, said that the increase
enables OPEC to ‘‘reach a unified
price.” Saudi Arabia, which has
repeatedly insisted that oil prices
must be reduced, agreed to raise
the price in return for a pledge by
other OPEC members that their
prices would be lowered even-
tually.

The accord includes an agree-
ment that the Saudis, if they are
satisfied with the moderation on
prices by other OPEC members,
would cut back their production
by one million barrels a day next
year, to 8.5 million barrels a day.

Industry analysts say a $2-a-
barrel increase by the Saudis
would not have a noticeable im-
pact on the cost of petroleum pro-
ducts in the U.S., since the rise is
less than five cents a gallon and
since Saudi Arabis accounts for
only about seven percent of the
nations total oil supplies.

The agreement, under which
other members would freeze pre-
sent prices, was a last effort by
the oil cartel to reach an accord
before the summit meeting of all
13 OPEC chiefs of state in
Bagdad, Iraq in November.

The new accord will lift the
price of one-third of OPEC’s oil
by $2 a barrel because the Saudis
produce that much.

OPEC’s official price is $32 a
barrel.

Soviets demand

return of defector

The Soviet Union has demand-
ed the return of a soldier who has
sought political asylum in the
United States Embassy in Kabul,
Afghanistan.

The request for the return of
the enlisted man was made in the
Afghan capital by Soviet Em-
bassy officials.

The State Department is ap-
prehensive about the safety of the
14 American diplomats in
Kabul. It believes the Afghan
authorities might use force to
retrieve the soldier upon instiga-
tion by the Russians.

But, John H. Trattner, State
Department spokesman, said the
United States had informed the
Soviet and Afghan Governments
that it is counting on them to in-
sure the safety of the American
Embassy.

David D. Newsom, the Under
Secretary of State for Political
Affairs, met with Ambassador
Dobrynin of the Soviet Union and
urged Moscow to use its influence
to allow the soldier to leave
Afghanistan if he wants to come
to the United States. The Soviets
are reportedly insisting that the
soldier be returned.

Shortages of nuke
material high in US

The Carter administration is
facing the question of whether to
increase production of bomb-
grade plutonium at the same
time the United States is
discouraging foreign govern-
ments from acquiring stockpiles
of such materials.

The United States is not pro-
ducing enough plutonium and
other bomb-grade substances to
create a new generation of
nuclear weapons over the next
decade, the Defense and Energy
Departments have concluded.

Secretary of Defense Harold
Brown has reported that existing
stockpiles of bomb-grade
materials are so low that delays
have already occurred in some
nuclear weapons programs.

The growing shortage in
plutonium and tritium, another
nuclear-weapons material, has
put pressure on President Carter
to approve a plan for expanding
American production of bomb-
grade substances for the first
time in more than 15 years.

The administration, State
Department and arms control
aides say any decision to increase
production would be viewed
abroad as hypocritical.

The House and Senate Armed
Services Committee has inserted
funds in the budget request for
the fiscal year 1981 to increase
plutonium production.

US seeks to limit

foreign steel imports

The Carter administration is
quickly developing a program to
combat the dumping of foreign
steel in U.S. markets.

Under the program, the
government would keep track of
all imports. The steel industry
would then be exempted from fil-
ing dumping complaints, in
which the complaining firm must
prove the foreign maker is
unloading steel at prices below
production costs or at prices
charged to customers at home.

The new program is designed
to win the votes of laid-off
steelworkers. The dumping issue
is crucial for President Carter in
the steelmaking towns of Penn-
sylvania and Ohio. Recent polls
have shown Republican presiden-
tial candidate Ronald Reagan
slightly ahead in both states,
which hold a total of 52 electoral
votes.

Imports have left more than
100,000 U.S. steelworkers idle, ac-
cording to David Roderick, chair-
man of U.S.Steel Corp.

Commerford echoed this opi-
nion: ‘Up until last year, we felt
it was an adequate policy .. . but
after our talks of last year and
the Delaware Valley incident, we
felt it was imperative that we
make some change in our
stance.”

Both Commerford and Dunlop
expect the Residential Life staff
to be the primary enforcers of the
new policy. In prior years, resi-
dent assistants and residence
directors were expected to
supervise hall parties.

The new policy is markedly dif-
ferent.

“Instead of staff availability,
they need to interact with the
students in a different way, to re-
mind them of the University’s ex-
pectations,” Commerford said.
Thus far, Commerford and
Dunlop report no serious pro-

blems in implementing the new
policy. Added Dunlop: ‘We
believe that the students will not
put the R.A.’s in a position of
jeopardy.”

Among the R.A.’s, however,
confusion is only now beginning
to subside over the enforcement
issue. One R.A. in Kress Hall
described the policy as ‘“‘virtually
impossible to enforce” adding
that ‘we were pretty confused
about how far we have to carry
out this rule. A lot of R.A.’s were
upset that we weren't notified
sooner.”

Dunlop said ‘‘We mishandled
that badly — our lateness in in-
forming the R.A.’s of the new
policy. I feel badly for our staff
that they did not know this at the
time they were offered the jobs.”

IFC to charge frosh

The Intrafraternity Council
voted Tuesday to institute a $2
registration fee for all men in-

The primary reason for the new
fee is to support IFC functions
such as Greek Week, the Rush
booklet, and publicity cam-
paigns, according to IFC Presi-
dent Steve Kohn ’81.

“Costs for fraternity men have
gotten extremely high, and we
felt that a registration fee would
be the best way to raise funds
rather than increase IFC dues,”
he said.

“Money is collected at other

universities and by the
Panhellenic Council here,’’ Kohn
said. Freshman girls who
register are presently charged
$1.
“Preshmen are getting eight
weeks of rush and a really good
time, and two dollars isn’t too
much to ask,” Kohn said.

‘At a meeting held earlier this
week, fraternity rush chairmen
voted overwhelmingly not to
charge the fee. “Tt serves no

B.U. liquor policy

mirrors Connecticut

By MATT KARANIAN

An alcoholic consumption policy similar to the one endorsed here
‘by the University was initiated at a Connecticut college several
‘months ago, and has been a “great success” according to the dean of
student affairs there, Richard Judd.

Central Connecticut State College, located in New Britain, Conn.,
initiated a policy in January which prohibits the consumption or
possession of liquor out-of-doors on campus or in the public areas of
college buildings or dormitories.

According to Judd, ‘‘drinking in private rooms is alright, but hall
parties are outlawed.”

Since the policy’s inception, there has been a “drastic” decline in
police complaints, vandalism and in absenteeism on Mondays and
Fridays, Judd said.

Judd denied that the college’s motive in establishing this policy
was to limit its liability. Before the policy was adopted, however, the
College had been sued twice by students who were physically injured
after drinking at a college party.

No litigation has been presented against the school since January.

Most of the college’s 6,700 students have been complying with the
new policy, Judd said. Violations of the ban can lead to ‘‘warnings,
suspension or expulsion.”

Punishment of this sort is not expected to be taken against
violators of the policy at Bucknell, but students here who are
minors—less than 21 years of age—may encounter problems with local
law enforcement agencies.

Although Lewisburg police ‘don’t make a habit of conducting
raids” at Bucknell, they will answer complaints against parties, ac-
cording to police lieutenant Dale Yount.

If minors are found drinking, they could be subject to arrest.

Not so Fine

Professor Douglas Sturm recently advised his class to memorize
the Constitution’s First ‘Amendment: ‘‘Learn it,” he more than sug-
gested, ‘‘It will come in handy some day.”

This week Norman Fine, chief of Campus Security, publicly ac-
cused this newspaper of being censored by the University ad-
ministration in the form of Dean of Student Affairs John Dunlop. The
Bucknellian is — of course — committed to the principles of freedom
of speech and press provided in the Constitution. The University has
not violated our rights in any way. No member of the administration
edits our copy or even sees it before Friday afternoon.

While we recognize the mishandling of the security force by the
University, the misconceptions and unsubstantiated complaints by
Fine sound to us like a bunch of sour gripes.

We must question both the integrity and authority of a man prone
to such brash and irresponsible statements. We staunchly defend
our opinion expressed last week that a new security director is
necessary.

It seems appropriate, therefore, that we publicly remind Chief
Fine that while he has the freedom of speech, so to do we have the
freedom of the press.

We’re more anarchist than collectivist

To the Editor:

In last week’s Bucknellian,
Richard Pisano argued that
“collectivist professors had over-
run’’ the economics and the
political science departments.
Dismally, Pisano ended his arti-
cle arguing that ‘students, alum-
ni and especially trustees’’
should pressure Dennis O’Brien
to redress the ideological balance
in these two departments.

Such pleas for a _ grand
equilibrium are often made con-
cerning social science depart-
ments, since, invariably, those
who study American culture
closely discover that parts of it
stink to high-heaven. And, public
discussion of the stench often pro-
vokes outsiders. For example,
several corporations recently
have funded over thirty ‘chairs

of free enterprise’’ in the US.
(including one at Stanford). The
purpose of each of these chairs is
to bring the ideology of free
enterprise into the classroom to
compete with that of the ima-
gined collectivists. Given his
view, then, Pisano is part of an
ongoing cacophonous choir, bear-
ing much sound and no small
amount of fury.

But, sweetly, universities have
procedures which, though
typically tedious, do not readily
give in to such pressures exerted
by those off campus and unin-
formed adequately to offer sage
advice on personal matters.
Specifically, adding faculty
members, of any persuasion, to
the economics department would
involve a selection of a preferred
candidate by the department

(with counsel from our majors)
to be presented to the administra-
tion, with a very strong likelihood
that this choice would be ap-
proved. There is, in other words,
very little left in this process for
anyone else to do: we faculty and
students, along with Ms. Ann
Witkowski, are the economics
department, and, as such, we
know better (by a wide margin
would be my guess) than anyone
else who should join us as a col-
league.

Fortunately, like most en-
cumbrances of this world, this
one has its silvery side for Mr.
Pisano. In fact, the economics
department has already been
decollectivized, and by its own
past hiring practices. And, were
Mr. Pisano aware of even the
most superficial aspects of the

Administraton playing games?

To the editor:

The Bucknellian cannot see
anything wrong with bringing in
a ‘Director of Security?”

Iam incredulous!

What is wrong is that the ad-
ministration is playing a chess
game using Chief Fine and his
assistants as pawns.

A dual purpose is being served:
1. Fine is being made an example
of to the other foreman. 2. Im-
provements won as a result of
unionization will be credited to
the reorganization of the new
“Director.’’ Our security depart-
ment already has men capable to
reorganize. For years we have
suggested this course of action,
and our suggestions were re-
jected.

Since our unionization, Mr.
Zeller has decided that a B.A.
degree is a requirement for the
position of chief. An A.A. degree
is to be required for future of-
ficers. All responsibilities that
the new ‘‘Director’’ is to assume
have in the past been carried out
by people with a high school
education. The East Buffalo and
Lewisburg Police Departments
are staffed by 11 trained officers.
They are excellent men, but
would not qualify as security of-
ficers under Mr. Zeller’s plan.

I have described the cir-
cumstances under which we work
to professional police officers,
and they usually laugh. Would
they work under similar condi-
tions? No.

Ask a professional if he thinks

we should be trained, and he'll
say ‘‘of course.” Mr. Bell (he’s an
engineer) thinks it’s a waste of
time and money. He says we can
go to the use of local police, and
as an example he mentions
tampering with fire apparatus.

Ask Chief Heiter of Lewisburg
if his officers will issue warnings
to students or turn them over to
the administration for action, the
way campus security does. Rare-
ly or never will be the answer.
Ask him if you can get a perma-
nent police record for tampering
with fire apparatus. The answer
is yes. Ask what happens if you
are the victim of a crime and an
untrained security officer makes
a minor mistake on the case. The
criminal goes free.

In the Bucknellian, Chief
Heiter mentions “illegal han-
dguns on campus.” Ask for
details. You will find that in this
particular incident the local
police received the call for
assistance after the suspect arm-
ed with a .357 magnum handgun
was apprehended by a security
officer.

We do not know the cir-
cumstances of a call until we get
to the scene. We are required to
answer police-type calls! There
are hundreds of incident reports
on file, and they prove this point.

I simply point out that in over
six years of protecting the people
and property of Bucknell I have
been bruised, scratched, bitten
and cut, and I do not want to end

up dead. The administration
wants the appearance of a police
force, but we only have the
authority of watchmen.

I think that it is very un-
fortunate that Mr. Bell and Mr.
Zeller have become locked into a
rigid anti-union position. We had
hoped to enter a _ period of
reasonable dialogue on the sub-
ject of security.

way we Bucknell economists
think about the economy, he
would realize how foolish is his
judgement that we are ‘‘collec-
tivists”’. As I read things, more of
us would call ourselves anarchist
than collectivist, and without
question, most would not think of
themselves as either of these.
Finally, it is interesting to
speculate about how the alumni,
students and especially the
trustees, now bothered by our
political inclinations (if there are
such people) would react to the
utter decollectivism sometimes
imagined by the anarchist, where
everything, including large pro-
perty holdings, are fragmented
entirely and shared widely.

To the Editor:

I'd like to express my con-
gratulations to Beth Sipple and
the rest of the C.A. crew for their
excellent efforts on ‘‘Christy’s
Gate.” The charming and re-
laxed environment comple-
mented the tasty, reasonably
priced bill of fare. This
refreshing social atmosphere is
long overdue at Bucknell. Best
wishes to future success.

Homogenize

the liberality

To the Editor:

Curricular reform is a win-
ding subject at Bucknell—the
present effort is more than
four years old. Teachers
gather about to mete out their
various concerns for the
academic and _ intellectual
world. It is, John Kennedy
once said, an honorable preoc-
cupation.

Unfortunately, radicals tend
to seize the curricular agenda
and work to incorporate per-
sonal ideology into what will
eventually be issued. This
describes the bombastic no-
tions of Messrs. John
Kirkland, Douglas Sturm,
Dennis O’Brien and Bob
Chambers, who have each
worked to homogenize the
liberality which has made
Bucknell a thriving, great in-
stitution.

No person is free if he must
think like another. Thus I
kindly reject thematic cur-
riculum.

Rather, curriculum, and I
mean the best curriculum,
must rely upon clean and pure
structure to let it operate. In
this way the vivid per-
sonalities of faculty may with
freedom present their best
and brightest ideas, and the
recipients can struggle to
develop from them their own
guiding themes.

Freshman Class
Officers

President

Michael Concordia

1, I am experienced in student affairs. 2.
Td like to see a unified freshman class.
Unification is the first step in achieving our
goals. 3. Only through active student input
will I be able to determine what the class as
a whole wants. 4. I'd like to assist my
classmates by doing anything I possibly
could to carry out their wishes. 5. I would
organize class activities such as picnics,
dances and parties. 6. I can best represent
the ideas and needs of the class through ac-
tive leadership.

John Held

Iam running for freshman class president
because I want to integrate the class as
much as possible with extracurricular ac-
tivities. There are many people who still do
not know each other and this can be cor-
rected. The intrigue of political machinery
and the storm and stress of decision making
do not bother me.

Ihave followed politics closely most of my
life and eventually I hope to enter United
States politics and help guide the nation
through the socio-economic turmoil of the
21st century. I am an avid debater; my op-
ponents always know my views. I feel I am
qualified to evaluate vast quantities of in-
formation and from that distill a rational
decision.

The underlying premise of my platform is
simple: I want to create a more integrated
freshman class. In addition, life should be
made as pleasant as possible for students
while still maintaining Bucknell's reputation
as a high quality institution. It is inap-
propriate to ask every student to be rabidly
interested in politics so it is that much more
important to secure responsible officials.
Every political state in history has eventual-
ly fallen due to decayed administrations.

I urge every student to explore the view-
points and political philosophies of the can-
didates thoroughly on Sunday at 8 p.m. in
Roberts Lounge. I welcome debate or discus-
sion on any political topic with any in-
terested student or professor at any time. I
especially urge all students to vote in the up-
coming election. The maintenance of
political society can only be assured by peo-
ple, not institutional inertia.

starting official rush late in September adds
to freshman restlessness.

A solution to this lack of clarity in policy is
a clearly stated position and procedure con-
cerning alcohol. As a solution or alternative
to this new administration stand, we would
support an earlier start for official freshman
rush and designated “‘legal”’ areas on cam-
pus that could be rented to various groups or
classes who want to have parties where
alcohol will be served.

ABS is attempting to integrate the Univer-
sity curriculum more closely with the ex-
tracurricular activities on campus this year,
and we would help in any way to further this
plan. In order to keep our community
vibrant and multifaceted, there needs to be
more administration financial and moral
support for activities outside of the
classroom.

We must represent as well as give direc-
tion to our fellow classmates and we will ac-
tively seek your suggestions, complaints and

CANDIDATES FOR VICE PRESIDENT, CLASS OF ‘84: From left,
Paul Mihok, Scooter Hoerrner and Nick Badami.

Dan Huck

Herb Grice

The intent of our campaign is not to make
empty promises that our own power limita-
tions, as freshman class officers, would not
allow us to fulfill. However, there are serious
problems and administrative deficiencies
within the University community that we
recognize and would attmept to modify.
Foremost among our concerns are the new
policy limitations on alcoholic beverages
and their consumption.

We do not advocate breaking Penn-
sylvania drinking laws, but we also feel the
University administration is not dealing with
the problem clearly or realistically. Damage
to freshman dorms is an issue in itself and is
not strictly a result of hall parties. Likewise,

Vice-President
Nick Badami

Let me tell you, unexpressable, yet .com-
mon to us all, is the feeling I got when Dad
turned and left me standing alone in front of
a strange-looking building called the Univer-
sity Center. The first contact I had was with
two upperclassmen who handed me a folder
with my name, Nicholas Badami, on it. I told
them to call me ‘‘Nick.’’ So began by first
day as a freshman. I arrived at Freshman
Camp and was deposited amidst other ap-
prehensive persons. As these strangers
became individuals through various ‘‘ac-
tivities” I became aware of the extraor-
dinary friendliness and enthusiasm we
shared. Friends came naturally and surpris-

ingly fast. The freshmen at the camp con-
sidered themselves special in that we had
such tremendous spirit and fellowship.

When I arrived at campus, however, I
realized that we were not special, rather the
entire Class of 1984 is special. That is when I
decided that I would like to have the honor of
representing such a fine class. It is true that
we are all freshmen, but that is something to
be proud of! We are all beginning again, so
let’s start off on the right foot with class of-
ficers that have the initiative and drive to get
things done because a step in the right direc-
tion will always bring us closer to our goals

We need not look forward to the years
ahead when we are juniors or seniors. We
have something the juniors and seniors don’t
have: time. Time to make the Class of 1984
the best in Bucknell’s history. These next
four years of our lives will be the most trying
yet the most enjoyable. Elect me to the posi-
tion of vice-presidency and I will do my very
utmost to make our class one to be proud of

Scooter Hoerrner

I am running for vice president of the
Class of 1984 for three basic reasons, all of
which mean a great deal to me. My first
reason for running is the sense of ac-
complishment I get from seeing things done
right. Being vice president would give me
the opportunity to blend my ideas with those
of the other students to create the best possi-
ble plans.

Another reason I have for seeking office is
because of the enjoyment I get from working
with people. This summer I had a job which
let me work closely with people and I found
that I really enjoyed it. By being vice presi-
dent, I would get a chance to work with other
freshmen and also alumni and I know it
would be something that I would enjoy.

A third reason for my campaigning is
school pride. I have been here only two
weeks but already I can sense a strong feel-
ing of school spirit and tradition. Bucknell is
a school long in tradition and by being vice
president I would try my utmost to carry on
this tradition of achievement.

Putting it into one line, I would say the vice
presidency is a job I want to do, a job I know
I could do, and a job I hope, you the Class of
1984, will let me do.

Paul Mihok

As a vice-presidential candidate I realize I
will not be making any earth-shattering deci-
sions. However, I do notice areas where im-
provements can be made. The telephone
lines out of town could be increased to allow
more people a chance to call home. Too
many times it takes too long to reach your
family. Also, an increase in the allocation of
freshman shower hot water would be helpful.
My third and final reason for running is sim-
ple. Student government is the initial step a
person must take in order to enter major
U.S. politics. For years the power of change
has rested in the hands of the students. This
power, however, had been useless because it
has been spread out and diverse. It must be
concentrated in order to be effective. To in-
fluence legislation the students must channel
their energies into one focal point. I can be
that focal point. The students can no longer
be content to let others run their lives. It is
now time for students to influence their own
destinies.

Secretary-
Treasurer

Mary Anne Broderick
Thomas Burke

Strong, responsible officers, able and will-
ing to represent as well as unify the Class of
1984, are necessary for a_ successful
freshman year both academically and
socially. I am running for secretary/
treasurer because I am sure that I can make
a positive contribution to our class. It is my
intention to bring our class together with
many diverse activities and fund raisers.

One idea I would like to see put into action
is a counseling service for students having
difficulties with any of their courses. Such a
service would be run like the ride sheet
system in the University Center. Also, study
breaks would be a beneficial activity for
many students. These small get togethers
would ease the tension before exams. People
with ideas for class activities should be able
to contribute them to the officers for con-
sideration.

I have considerable experience with the
duties of a treasurer, having been the
treasurer of an American Field Service
chapter. I am majoring in accounting, work-
ing toward a Bachelor of Science degree in
business administration and I plan to
become a Certified Public Accountant. I
would really like to pull our class together
and get started on a great year. If we all par-
ticipate, I am sure that our class will have an
outstanding first year at Bucknell.

Steve Garfinkel

Asa candidate, I am genuinely concerned
with what occurs at Bucknell. In any class or
organization, there are those apathetic in-
dividuals who choose not to participate; I do
not choose that path. In my later high school
years, I realized that activities, especially
student government, provide challenges and
obstacles that make life exciting. Through
the office of secretary/treasurer and the
assumption of the subsequent responsibility
which it brings, I may provide myself with
this type of challenge.

Through meeting this challenge, I can pro-
vide not only myself, but the Class of 1984
with a sense of accomplishment and achieve-
ment. Meeting a goal in a successful manner
is difficult. I, with your support, can reach
the goal of being elected to the office of
secretary/treasurer.

Campaign articles, many times, can sound
misleading. The following demonstrates why
I want this office and why I feel that | am
competent for the job. I sense that I am
relatively representative of the type of stu-
dent who attends Bucknell. I care what goes
on here: this is my home. I will not hesitate
to voice my opinions at class meetings, even
though my title will be secretary/treasurer.
I intend to offer suggestions to the class
president and vice-president (even if I am
not elected) in addition to completing the
other tasks that the office demands.

My past experiences have not been
numerous, but I have worked in student
government before. I have also held a job
which, among other things, entailed book-
keeping. I am very organized. Therefore, I
will have no difficulties in meeting the re-
quirements of my office.

Most importantly, I want to do this job; I
search for the challenge that the office will
provide. A vote for Garfinkel is a vote not on-
ly for confidence, but for accomplishment.

yreen Walsh

Why does a person seek an office in the stu-
dent government? For me personally, I have
found that it is a good way in which to be in-
volved, hear ideas and get ideas heard. I feel
that student government should not be
limiting but expanding. The more that are
involved the better it is. Too many times it
seems that the students’ views are not lis-
tened to and yet the outcome of whatever is
at hand affects them the most.

In the past, I was elected to be part of the
general student council. Last year, I served
as vice president of the student body at my
high school. It was the first year that I had
held such a position and found that I really
liked it. Running for a position in the student
government was a big decision, but after
going through the year, I know that it was
worth the effort.

I like being involved and contributing to
my class. We are one of the largest and
brightest classes that has entered Bucknell
recently. If we work at it, we should be
remembered as the best.

lam anxious to serve as a voting member
of the student congress. I like meeting new
people and working with a concerned, active
group. The ABS is an important organization
for it permits the students to vocalize their
suggestions for a better student life. As dorm
representative, I would be more than willing
to do this in addition to relating back to the
student body the results taken up by the
ABS

In the position of dorm representative, I
am considering ideas for student breaks, en-
joyable fund-raising activities and, possibly,
a band party for the freshman quad. There is
much we can do but first we need the ap-
propriate people in the right positions. I look
forward to serving you in the future.

David Grossman

I feel that the residents of Kress Hall
deserve equal and effective representation
within the ABS. In order to achieve this, ex-
perienced and dedicated congressmen must
be elected as dormitory representatives.

As my high school class president for four
years, I learned how to responsibly deal with
the needs of my class, much as I would
cooperate with those of you who live in Kress
Hall, working towards common goals in the
dormitory’s best interests.

As a dorm legislator, I will strive to make
the Kress voice heard, so that any
grievances or suggestions we would like to
present about our dorm will not go
unanswered.

As a member of the ABS, I will represent
Kress’s better interests in the enactment of
ABS legislation. I will also act as an effective
liaison between the ABS and my consti-
tuents, so that Kress residents are always
aware of what takes place during ABS
meetings, as well as the ABS’s plans for the
future.

Again, I would like to reiterate that I am
seeking this office not only as a result of
Kress Hall's entitlement to effective
representation, but also my desire to benefit
Kress Hall and to make it an integral part of
a well-balanced Bucknell community.

John Held

Jeff Sieber

I chose to run for dorm representative
because of my past experiences in leader-
ship and because I enjoy working with peo-
ple.

During my high school years, I served as
Class president, and student council vice-
president. I also helped with organizing
various other activities in my high school,
and enjoyed working with others.

Ihave had to work with people because of
the previously mentioned activities. I
believe that a dorm that works together can
accomplish the goals that they want to. With
my experience, I believe that I can lead
them to help our dorm achieve these goals.

Michael Sinclair
Roberts

Linda Ferguson

Jean ne ji aeger

Iam anxious to represent YOU individual-
ly and Roberts Hall in its entirety at ABS this
year.

I seek this significant position for several
reasons. First of all, I have a multitude of ex-
perience in student government and in
leadership positions. One of my favorite ac-
tivities in high school was grade council in
which I participated actively for four con-
secutive years. I also enjoy participating in
the affairs of my school and like presenting
new ideas for consideration.

Finally, as a hardworking, dedicated and
caring person, I am confident that I could do
a fantastic job.

My door and ears would always be open to
your suggestions. Let’s make it a great year
together! Vote Jeanne Jaeger for Roberts
Hall Dorm Representative. Thank you.

When I was twelve, my sister gave me a
plaque, featuring the PEANUTS character,
Lucy, which read, “If you can’t be right, be
wrong at the top of your voice!”” That was
supposed to be a hint; my sister thought I
argued too much.

Well, I still have that plaque standing on
my desk in 306 Roberts West. But I’ve
learned by now how to discuss things in a
productive way. As a reporter for my high
school paper, and here, for the
BUCKNELLIAN, I have had to know how to
listen to people’s opinions and how to repre-
sent differing viewpoints fairly.

I’ve had experience too, in presenting both
opinions and factual data to a group as a
delegate to Keystone Girls State, a program
in which high school juniors form their own
state government. I was the editor of the
KGS newspaper and a county party chair-
man. My other leadership qualifications in-
clude the presidency of SUBS (the Super
Useful Beautiful Servants), a community
volunteer organization, and of the Cliff-
hangers Club, which I also founded, where
the members take hiking and biking trips
together and participate in Christian
fellowship.

I have always enjoyed politics, whether
campaigning for someone else, as I did for
then-gubernatorial candidate Dick Thorn-
burgh, or for myself. I would welcome the
chance to represent you in the ABS. What
you think and what you have to say are im-
portant to me. As your representative, I
would make sure that both have a chance to
be heard.

Dorm life is an important aspect of col-

and like home, problems may arise and
changes may be necessary. Some of these
problems can’t be resolved without the help
of the ABS Congress. I will be responsible for
informing them of the problems, ideas or
opinions you may have and see that action is
taken.

I will represent any and all suggestions
from the dorm as a whole or from in-
dividuals. These ideas can be anything from
dorm activities to personal recommenda-
tions. I will keep you well informed as to the
results and progress of any recommenda-
tions made to the Congress.

In the past two years, I was representative
to State and National Key Club Conventions.
I also served as class representative to the
student government in high school. I have

had much experience in this area and I will
work hard to have your views heard and
make this a great year for you.

Susan Stanley

There are several reasons why I am seek-
ing this position. It is a common problem
that students don’t always have the chance
to express their feelings, suggestions and
ideas to the proper authorities at any school.
This includes Bucknell.

If elected, I will act as a communication
link between the students, faculty, ad-
ministration and the ABS. Also, with the
organization of such activities as study
breaks and parties, I hope to help the
students of Roberts Hall become better ac-

quainted with one another. Of utmost im-
portance is my intent to listen to your ideas
for creating a more relaxed atmosphere and
applying them to our hall. Your vote for me
would be a positive move towards a more
relaxed, exciting and rewarding year.

I am running for this office for two
reasons. The first is that I would like to get
involved with student government in an ac-
tive and effective way. The second reason is
that if I want to be assured of a good student
government at Bucknell, I have to get in-
volved. There is no excuse for sitting back
and then complaining that nothing is getting
done. I want to make sure things get done for
Trax.

Dawson R. Bartlett
Jeffrey Chambers
Jack Collins

The reason behind my running for office is
that of representation. I feel I can give the
students of Trax what they want for their
hall. I’m not making any promises of
changes that should be made. How could I? I
have only been here two weeks. I just want
solid representation for Trax Hall.

I also feel that my principles are in the
best interest of Trax Hall. I want to run fora
purpose, not popularity. The purpose being
to serve my peers in any way I can. I will not
let my own personal interests stand in the
way. Only the opinions of my constituents in
Trax Hall will count.

That is why I am running and I believe in
it. It is concise and that is what I hope to be
as an elected representative. Get to the point
of the problem and resolve it!

reasons. Being a senior and having enjoyed

way for me to do this is to become a member

I feel that it is essential to have a balance of

balance by representing the views of frater-

technical background I have will be of some
value to the Congress.

Robin Meredith ’82

The ABS has much to offer the student
body if it is composed of interested leaders —
people who do not take the attitude ‘“‘my vote
doesn’t matter;”’ people who are willing to
become involved and work for a purpose.

That is the reason why I want to be an ABS
representative. There is much work to be
done. The opinions, attitudes and needs of
students must be expressed to those in
charge of four years of their life.

Working within the administration this
summer, I was often asked my opinion
because they said “you know how the
students feel.” If the student body is working
up to its potential, the administration should
already know how the students feel. As a
result of the lack of awareness, the students
view is often pushed aside.

I take pride in this University, knowing
that the bad points it does have can be im-
proved by joint student effort, and by my
own effort, not that of “‘someone else.”

Off campus students have very special
needs apart from the residents and these
needs often pass unheard. As a commuter
student I fully understand the problems that
arise and I intend to support not only the stu-
dent body as a whole, but the students living
off campus in particular.

In addition, having grown up in this area, I
can relate the problems and advantages for
the townspeople and the students of the loca-
tion of Bucknell.

I want your support because I intend to
support you.

Justice in America to be examine

Different concepts of justice
will each be discussed in turn

By LYNNE RUTHERFORD

Is there justice for children? Is the
American prison system fair? To explore
these and other topics, a four day sym-
posium conducted by the Bucknell Student
Lectureship Committee entitled, ‘Justice
in America,” begins on campus Monday.

Justice is an all-encompassing concept
that means different things to different
people. Throughout history, every Society
has set their own standard of criminal
punishment: an eye for an eye, enforced
slavery, or, as is the case in the U:S., in-
carceration.

“Justice means the right to due process
under the law, which is what the prison
project is trying to do,” said Karl Patten,
professor of English. Speaking as a
representative of the Lewisburg Prison
Project, Patten voiced a concern common
to many of us—the treatment and
rehabilitation of our nation’s criminals.

Today, we are faced with an ultimatum,
for whether our prison system is too harsh
or too lenient, it is simply not working.
Soaring crime rates, particularly in our
cities, attest to that. Unless some type of
change is instituted soon, the problem will
continue to grow. The types of alterations
that are desperately needed will be among
the topics discussed during the sym-
posium.

Yet justice reaches beyond the criminal
arena, permeating the social, economic,
and political areas of society as well. “It’s
a complex question. I’d have to think about

Panelists to debate criminal Justice system

By STEVE RICHARDS

Is there justice in the prison system?
That is an all important question to many
former and present inmates of federal
prisons, as well as attorneys and
criminologists. It will be the subject of a
panel discussion here featuring two na-
tionally konwn authorities, civil rights
lawyer Aryeh Neier, and psychoanalyst
Ernest Van den Haag.

This discussion, the third of a four-part
“Justice in America’’ seminar, will take
place Wednesday at 7 pm in the University
Center Forum. Matt Silberman, associate
professor of sociology, will moderate.

Aryeh Neier, the son of Jewish refugees
from Nazi Germany, is a former executive
director of the American Civil Liberties
Union. He is the author of two books on the
U.S. criminal justice system, has written
numerous magazine and newspaper ar-
ticles, and is a frequent lecturer. Neier is
now a professor at the New York Universi-
ty School of Law.

Neier is highly concerned with what he
sees as the dehumanizing treatment many
prisoners receive. ‘Institutions usually
content themselves with degrading new in-
mates. They strip them naked, take away
their possessions, issue formless clothing,
assign them numbers, yell at them and tell
them who is boss,’’ Neier told the New
York (Times) on July 3, 1980.

Dr. Ernest Van den Haag, a social
philosopher, educator, lecturer, and
author of the highly respected book,
Political Violence and Civil Disobedience,
will also participate.

Van den Haag, as the title of his book im-
plies, is concerned with the control of
crime. In contrast to Neier, he will present
a conservative view of the criminal justice
system.

it more, but to me, justice implies
fairness,” said Linda Thomas, visiting in-
structor of political science.

Fairness? Is our nation totally fair to its
weak, including its youth? Ken Wooden
should have much to say on that subject
Thursday night.

The courtroom is another legal institu-
tion justice plays a paramount role in. ‘In
America, lawyers are trained to think only
of their clients. Justice is presumed to
emerge mysteriously out of combat bet-
ween two attorneys in the courtroom,”
said Michael Moohr, associate professor of
economics.

Once again, a fear familiar to many of us
is being voiced: that there are so many
legal loopholes, particularly for the rich,
that true justice never triumphs.

William Kunstler, who as a well-known
civil rights lawyer has fought more than a
few of those battles, will address this and
other viewpoints in his lecture, ‘‘Is There
Justice in America?”’

Along with these particular concerns,
the symposium analyzes the more general
ideal of justice, articulated by John
Peeier, professor of political science. tts
avery complex question—most important-
ly, everyone having an equal chance to
develop their own potential as a human be-
ing.”

That chance is lacking in our own society
today. The ‘Justice in America” sym-
posium is an important event simply
because it points out a few of the many
reasons why.

A third panelist, Faruq Muhamma4, will
offer an inside view of prison life the others
cannot. As a former inmate of the
Mississippi State Penitentiary, he is now
the information coordinator at the Na-
tional Prison Project, an offshoot of the
American Civil Liberties Union. The NPP
deals with the enforcement of inmates’
rights throughout all federal prisons.

The fourth panelist is Karl Patten, pro-
fessor of English, who as a representative
of the Lewisburg Prison Project has a

great interest in ‘‘improving the conditions
of prison confinement.’’ Among the pro-
blems the LPP hopes to help correct are:
overcrowding, discrimination, mail
tampering, beatings and arbitrary rule en-
forcement.

The LPP is a local volunteer oganization
that not only monitors the rights of the
prison population, but provides parole
representation to those who cannot afford
it. In the words of a Lewisburg inmate,
“You cannot imagine how frustrating it is

to see one’s privileges being steadily taken
away week after week for no reason at
all.”

Federal judge James E. Doyle said as
far back as 1972, “I am persuaded that the
institution of prison probably must end. In
many respects, it is as intolerable as was
the institution of slavery.” Some members
of the panel agree with him, others do not.
But the controversy over our nation’s
prison system will rage long after the
discussion ends.

Kunstler continues to defend
from a radical point of view

By STEVEN LU

“Jt is no longer a case of holding a picket sign and marching somberly, of writing
your congressmen, of supporting the best candidate. These items call for more drastic
action. This is your decade, your generation, and your world. Remember the title of
Jerry Rubin’s book—Do tt?”

The date was April 8, 1970, the speaker was William Kunstler, and the 1,500 Columbia
University students were an attentive and receptive audience. As Kunstler suggested,
they did it—1,500 students left the lecture and proceeded to riot and protest upon their
campus.

For Kunstler, it was nothing new. The baritone voice of the self-proclaimed
“frustrated actor’’ had already proven effective enough to incite riots at the University
of Illinois, the University of Buffalo, the University of Santa Barbara, and again at Col-
umbia one week later.

Kunstler told these students that theirs was a world of repression and that ‘‘The time
has come to resist illegitimate authority by any means necessary.”

What Kunstler meant by illegitimate authority was the United States government,
which as he saw it enforced repression of its youth through the Vietnam draft. The means
of resistance was anything from trespass to kidnapping.

One might get the impression that Kunstler was a young, struggling lawyer who
spurred on his audience for the sake of publicity. In truth William Kunstler was, at that
time, a 50 year old attorney who had received his bachelor’s degree from Yale as a Phi
Beta Kappa, and had in 1941 been a recipient of the U.S. Army’s Bronze Star. In fact,
Kunstler could have been taken for a model of the successful upper-class American.

Yet he was, as he says it, “a white middle-class Jew who had turned on his class.””

The betrayal began in June, 1961, when Kunstler offered to defend five freedom fighters
whom he felt got arrested simply because one of them was black. Instead of continuing a
successful practice of divorce cases and civil suits, Kunstler went on to become a famous
civil-rights lawyer.

His clients have included such people as Stokely Carmichael, Dr. Martin Luther
King, the Chicago Seven, Julian Bond, and activisits Daniel and Phillip Berrigan.
Kunstler seems to have made a habit of being nearby whenever controversial court
cases were held.

Civil rights attorney William Kunstler is scheduled to deliver his lecture, “Is there Justice in

America?” on Monday. During the late sixties, he defended such luminaries as the Chicago
Seven and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.

During the period of 1968-71, the lawyer espoused his radical point of view in many
publications. This eventually led to scathing denunciations from the conservative Na-
tional Review, polite and sympathetic stories in Esquire, and somewhat empty write ups
in Life.

“J only defend those whose goals I share. I’m not a lawyer for hire, I only defend
those I love,” Kunstler insists. He demonstrated this belief by not asking fees from those
clients who could not afford payment and by arguing the defense as if he were the one
who stood accused. His passionate and theatrical courtroom manners earned him a
public denouncement printed in the American Bar Association J ournal.

what Uncle Tom’s Cabin did

This quote by Dr. Karl Men-

tion captures the spirit of what
Ken Wooden and his book
Weeping in the Playtime of
Others are all about.

An investigative reporter for
CBS’ “60 Minutes,’ author,
fighter for children’s justice,
Kenneth Wooden will be one of
the speakers participating in this
semester’s first symposium
organized by the Bucknell Stu-
dent Lectureship Committee. The
topic for the series of talks and
panel discussions, which will
begin next Monday and end with
Wooden’s talk on Thursday, is
“Justice in America:”’ Wooden is

scheduled to speak Thursday in
Vaughn Literature Auditorium.
The topic of his talk is “Justice
for Children — A Time for Ad-
vocacy.””

Wooden’s lecture will bring to
light a subject about which many
of us have never thought or knew
existed: the incarceration of
children in institutions
throughout the country.

After completing a 30 state
study of children in long term
detention, Wooden found ‘“‘hor-
rors such as whippings, tear-
gassing, rape and solitary con-
finement of children.’”’ In his
book, and in his lectures at col-
leges nationwide, Wooden
reveals these horrors, as well as
the individuals he feels are
responsible for these gruesome
social injustices — politicians,
bureaucrats, the court system,
and exploitative businessmen.

He has been actively engaged
in trying to persuade Congress to
pass legislation which will pro-
tect these institutionalized

children — the same Congress
that, he says is ‘happy to spend
$21 billion on the B-1 bomber but
only provides $13 million a year
for the National Right to Read
program.”

Wooden’s interest in the plight
of problem children is a very per-
sonal one, as he himself was
dismissed as uneducable as a
child. It is ironic that such a child
would re-enter society and not on-
ly prove it wrong about himself,
but also denounce the many in-
justices to other young people. In-
stead of being given a chance to
realize their potential, these
children are punished, Wooden
insists, for crimes which they
have not committed, or for being
an unlucky member of a broken
family environment.

Wooden’s message serves not
only to alert people around the
country to what is happening to
our nation’s youth, but to rally
them to the worthwhile cause of
rectifying an incompetent penal
system in America.

First 1980 presidential debate: three’s a crowd?

_By PHIL ANDREWS

Much has been said of Jimmy
Carter’s refusal to meet John
Anderson and Ronald Reagan in
this Sunday’s nationally televised
League of Women Voters-
sponsored debate. And rightly so.

Throughout the primary and
general election campaigns,
Carter has financed his reelec-
tion drive by drawing from the
national interest.

On the morning of the Illinois
primary, the nation awoke to
hear Carter announce that
significant progress had been
made in the efforts to secure the
release of the American hostages
in Iran.

For months, Carter has played
politics with the defense budget.
For example, he has stated sup-
port for the volunteer army, but
has consistently refused to sup-
port pay increases necessary to
attract and retain key military
personnel. He has championed
draft registration, contending
that it would save 90 to 100 days if
a draft were needed. In a
January, 1980 report, however,
Selective Service Director Ber-
nard Rostker wrote that only
seven days would be saved.

And now, as during the
primary campaign, Mr. Carter
has decided to forego a debate he
had pledged to participate in.

Fortunately, Sunday’s debate
will go on whether Carter is there
or not.

And so it will be John Anderson
and Ronald Reagan in the first,
and perhaps only, debate of the
general election campaign.

For Anderson, qualifying for
the League debates was essential
for a viable candidacy. It is the
only way he can become well-
known to the majority of the
American electorate.

If he stumbles, his candidacy
will be effectively over. If he does
well, there are enough voters
disillusioned with Mr. Carter and
Mr. Reagan to make him presi-
dent.

To ‘‘win” the debate and draw
close to the Democratic and
Republican nominees, Anderson
must articulate three things:

1) He must make a compelling
case that his National Unity plat-
form is superior to those of
Carter and Reagan. Crucial dif-
ferences need to be singled out.

He should stress the im-
portance of reducing US.
dependence on OPEC oil and ex-
plain his proposal for a 50 cent
tax on gasoline.

He should emphasize his sup-
port for a lean, flexible and
strong national defense, and ex-
plain why he opposed mammoth
missile systems like the MX. How
he plans to strengthen the
volunteer army should be made
clear as well.

And he should reiterate his
deep commitment to the Equal
Rights Amendment, and to a pro-
choice abortion position. His
leadership on civil rights issues
should be underscored.

2) He must highlight Carter’s
ineffectual leadership and
vacillation on domestic and
foreign policy.

3) He must demonstrate the
contradictions contained in many
of Reagan’s policy statements.

For example, Reagan will be
hard-pressed to explain how he
would raise defense spending,
lower taxes and balance the
budget without cutting popular
social programs.

Reagan will find people slow to
swallow his prescription of op-
position to the ERA and
rhetorical support for equal
rights for women.

And his professed concern for
nuclear arms control will be
viewed by many as incompatible
with his opposition to the SALT II
treaty.

While Anderson must adopt a
three-pronged approach, Reagan
has the luxury of attacking an
eminently vulnerable candidate
who will not be present to defend
his record — .or to probe
Reagan’s. The Republican
nominee will:

1) Blast Mr. Carter’s economic
policies as disastrous “for the
average American,’ and em-
phasize his support for the Kemp-
Roth plan to slash income taxes
by 30 percent over three years;

2) Characterize Carter’s
foreign policy as weak, using
Afghanistan, Iran and Nicaragua
as examples. If asked to specify
what he would do, he will tend to
beg off, stating that only the
president is privy to the requisite
information:

Army ROTC teaches pro-
fessionally oriented students Vi
to lead people and to direct
_ equipment to achieve speci-
fic objectives as an Active
or Reserve Officer.

If you’re looking for the
challenge of leadership, in
college and afterwards, look
into Army ROTC.

ARMY ROTC
LEARN WHAT IT TAKES TO LEAD

Reagan will propose large in-
creases in defense spending,
arguing for “peace through
strength;”

3) Emphasize his opposition to
“excessive government spen-
ding” and “unnecessary regula-
tion.” Reagan will not be specific
about the programs and regula-
tions he considers ‘‘excessive”’
and “unnecessary,” for that is
what many people disagree on.
He will refer liberally to his days
and record as governor of
California;

4) And he will ignore Anderson
— except when he can place
Anderson and Carter on one side
of an issue and himself on the
other.

Jimmy Carter also has a
strategy for the debate. He will
attempt to smother the barbs
from Baltimore with a plethora of
media events.

Katie Mansuy

If Carter ‘‘wins,”’ he will con-
tinue to avoid Anderson — even
at the expense of no debate with
Reagan. Should Carter “Jose,” he
may find he has no choice but to
join Anderson and Reagan a se-
cond time around.

Interestingly, House Minority
Leader John Rhodes (R-AZ)
believes that it is not in the na-'
tional interest that President
Carter, or any other President;
participate in campaign debates.
“Under the stress of the moment,
a sitting president is liable to say
some things that might harm ou
foreign policy or our domestic
policy.”

Presidents, however; are
under stress much of the time. It
goes with the job. Surely it is in
the national interest in 1980 to
have the opportunity before the
election to observe the presiden-
tial aspirants in close, pressure-
packed encounters of a triple
kind.

Anderson is a creation of the
media. But who isn’t?

Lately, it’s been very
fashionable to criticize the press.
Twenty five years ago everyone
talked about Russia and the
bomb. Just a few years ago
hating Nixon was chic.

People would compete for the
title of having hated Nixon first.

Today we scorn the media. We
deplore the little men with anten-
nae crawling around political
conventions chasing rumors. We
can’t wait for Cronkite to retire.
Ironically, it was Nixon who had
the foresight to despise the press
first.

So how is our presidential race
being reported or distorted?

First, we must realize that
politicians and the mass media
have a common interest in
avoiding issues. Why?

For candidates, issues cause
complications and don’t attract
many votes. Talk to George Bush
about China, he’ll tell you.

For the media, issues don’t sell
newspapers. We are thus left with
personalities, perceptions of
character and appearances.

Because of the media’s liberal
bias, Ronald Reagan suffers the
most from such dreadful
coverage. Jimmy Carter is
neither harmed nor helped. John
B. Anderson gets the best deal.

One at a time. The Democrats’
primary tactic is to portray

c
Bt cles apers, *
INdId print polars ¥

rugs,

Ronald Reagan as an old man
and as David Brinkley put it, ‘‘a
combination of Scrooge and the
Mad Bomber.”

The media are playing right
along.

Instead of carefully examining
positions and challenging
policies, they examine the

STOP

wrinkles on his chin and ask
whether he will step down if
senility sets in.

The Washington Post covered
Reagan’s visit with Vernon Jor-
dan, Urban League president.
Whoever wrote the caption for
the photo of Reagan somehow
forgot why Reagan was in the
hospital. The caption: “Ronald
Reagan spends forty minutes in
hospital.”’

Esquire magazine devoted its
August issue to the Republican
candidate. On the cover is a pic-
ture of Ronnie wearing a cowboy
hat and pointing a pistol cocked
and ready to fire. The title of the
issue: ‘‘We warned you about

- posters,

bamboo curtoins,
incense & oils, Soaps,
jewelry, boskers, etc.

JOHNSON. We warned you about
NIXON. We warned you about
CARTER. Now will you please
listen to us about REAGAN?”

After reading the magazine, I
was stunned. There was no bad
news. I shook the copy and turned
it upside down, hoping the ugly
stuff would fall out. Nothing.

The fact is, Esquire in-
vestigated all of Reagan’s past
and was disappointed. They
therefore printed an_ in-
criminating cover, expecting that
alone to sway their readers.

Even Garry Wills concluded his
piece with fallacious fluff: “‘the
scary thing about Reagan: that
he doesn’t scare us.”’ Profound.

Jimmy Carter has not had it
easy either. The press exploited
“Billygate’’ to sell as many
papers as it could. They have
reported all the scandals from
Lance to Andrew Young to Tim
Kraft, who was accused of using
cocaine this week.

Jack Anderson’s accusation
that Carter was planning an inva-
sion of Iran was of no help.

Perhaps out of gentleness or
humaneness, though, the media
has not pointed out his pitiful
record. We’ve got serious pro-
blems with our economy and
foreign policy. But the press
thinks that Ted Kennedy’s sup-
port should be the basis of the

Carter campaign, not solving our
national ills.

Now for Mr. Anderson. He too
is treated without regard to
issues. For he is the alternative,
as if that is a sufficient basis for
choosing a leader.

Rather than checking his votes
in Congress for the Kemp-Roth
tax cut and for nuclear power,
they check his ‘‘viability rating”
each day and tell us about his
wife Keke’s 49th birthday.

As I see it, Anderson is chang-
ing his views to attract the liberal
Kennedy folks, the Easterners,
and the New York Times
editorial board. He’s like the
Frenchman during the revolu-
tion, who sees the mob running
down the street and reaches for
his coat.

“Where are you going?”
friend asks.

his

“To find out where they’re run-
ning to soI can lead them.”

Fix

If I seem a bit tough on the man
from Illinois, remember that
Jimmy was once an attractive,
unknown alternative who lured
the press.

There are fundamental con-
tradictions in the proposals of all
three candidates. The rhetoric
has obviously befuddled the
reporters.

Reagan, Carter and Anderson
are magicians; and the reporters
are wide-eyed kids, often wat-
ching the decoy hand of the pro-
fessionals.

They’d better catch on to the
act.

Of course, we can’t blame the
media for everything, but they
could do a better job informing
the public.

So far they have created not
one candidate, Mr. President, but
three: a chic alternative who
mysteriously reconsiders; an in-
cumbent who flip-flops; and a
challenger too senile to recall
what he said originally.

Christy’s Gate’ is a
smashing success

By AMY KENNEDY

Christy’s Gate, a temporary
cafe run by Concern and Action,
opened Wednesday to en-
thusiastic response. The innova-
tion provides a change of pace for
those who are tired of the noisy
atmosphere of the Bison and
fraternity parties.

The ambience is that of a
Greenwich Village pub — re-
laxed, informal and, if the right
company is available, romantic.
The location is the Faculty
Lounge on the second floor of the
University Center. The simple
decor of the room has been
enhanced through the use of dif-
ferent sized round tables,
candlelight and the importation
of plants to create a totally new
image.

Live entertainment utilizing
the piano in the main room and
supplied by talented students pro-
vides a mellow background that
makes Christy’s Gate an ideal
place for uninterrupted conversa-
tion. Never does one feel
pressured to hurry and leave,
rather, visitors are encouraged to
linger over their repast and savor
the few moments of respite Chris-
ty’s Gate gives them.

Along with the tranquil mood
prevalent, there is also a superb
and unimposing menu — featur-
ing home-made pastries and all-
natural Pennsylvania cheeses at
reasonable prices.

Cheeses, served with crackers
or vegetable sticks, are fresh
from the dairy, and a basket con-
taining a generous portion of
Swiss or Havarti cheese or an ex-
ceptionally fine smoked cheese-
spread, costs $1.50. Onion dip
runs $1.25.

The pastries, for those with a
sweet tooth, are made by two
Muncy women and include a
cheese or raspberry danish with
streusel topping (30 cents) that
has the old-fashioned taste only
home-baking can give, cinnamon
bread with melted butter (25
cents), and warm sticky buns (20
cents).

To quench the thirst are two
drinks (both 50 cents) — an
orange mixture made popular by
the Orange Julius chain of snack
bars, and the Christy’s Special, a
frothy blend of orange and
grapefruit juices.

“The drinks are great,” one
student complimented, ‘‘but they
do need more variety.”

From the moment a customer
enters, the service he receives is
excellent. Six waiters and
waitresses on each shift, as well
as six more people in the kitchen,
labor to take and fill orders as
quickly and efficiently as possi-
ble. All workers at the Gate serve
on a volunteer basis and are
trained by CA members.

Student response to the new
gathering place is highly

favorable. On the first evening of
its three night run one could hear
positive comments from all
tables, the most frequently
voiced of which was, ‘‘I hope it
continues.”

According to Beth Sipple ’82,
organizer of and driving force
behind Christy’s Gate, ‘The
whole idea governing Concern
and Action is that if you want to
see something done you can
make it happen.”

The CA volunteers have been
monitoring the response of
students on each night, and will
next determine whether Wednes-
day, Thursday or Friday proved
the most popular. Once the best
day has been selected, CA hopes
to continue Christy’s Gate as a
bimonthly or possibly weekly
event. All ideas for continuation
are in the planning stage,
however; the future of Christy’s
Gate depends upon the feedback
it gets from students.

That is exactly what occured
with Christy’s Gate. After much
student input and expressed in-
terest, the idea was worked out
and the University was presented
with an enjoyable place to meet
friends and relax.

It is hoped that the Gate will not
close its doors for the last time at
midnight tonight. Students need a
relaxing and enjoyable place to
go where both books and alcohol
are left behind.

By DAVID O’CONNELL

The return of the Fitzwilliam String
Quartet to Bucknell after their residency
in the fall of 1978 has been long-awaited by
the local concert-going community. For
some, Sunday’s concert provided, like a
page from an album, another glimpse of a
group that many have called the world’s
primary interpreters of the works of
Shostakovich. For others, it provided the
first look at a cultural treat—one of the
most cohesive of today’s quartets in their
finest medium, as they performed not one,
but two Shostakovich quartets, the First
and the Ninth.

At first some might have been skeptical
about the logic of programming two
Shostakovich quartets, preferring to hear
them one at a time so that the full value of
each could stand alone and be pondered in
its entirety. However, the choice of the
First and Ninth provided an interesting
contrast of the early extrovert against the
pensive Shostakovich evident in his later
works.

The audience sat back against the hard
chapel pews and awaited the opening of
the C major quartet. Immediately the rich
warmth of tone and the precisely accurate
balance was evident. Too often quartets
are content to just play the notes, but the
Fitzwilliam interacts to the point where
the group becomes one entity with four
voices.

The first quartet is unpretentious,
unassuming, and uncomplicated both in its
logistics and its musical statements. It
received an appropriate, refreshing rendi-
tion that is best described as lighthearted.
The four movements were tied together
quite well, as everything seemed to lead up
to the finale.

The reverie of the first movement with
its rich, relaxed, rhapsodic harmony was
followed by a theme and variations that in-
creased the musical action. The third
movement served as a short buildup of ten-
sion which was effectively released by the
onrush of sound in the joyous finale.

Two qualities of the Fitzwilliam evidenc-
ed themselves quite readily in this piece.

_ ARTS

Meee ae eee sere ————e

String Quartet showcases Shostakovich

In the theme and variations movement,
particularly, the quartet met a high stan-
dard for sound texture. The requirement
that a listener not ‘notice’ the entrance of
a voice — rather, become aware gradual-
ly that the musical texture has changed --
was successfully fulfilled.

In the third movement, it becomes ob-
vious that the quartet realizes they must
strive to play as one unit. All four in-
struments are muted, providing a common
ground by which the blending of sound can
be judged.

As the Ninth quartet opened, one was im-
mediately aware that Shostakovich asks
for far more than printed notes. The begin-
ning was rather whimsical and un-
threatening, yet the quartet brought out a
thickness in the harmony that spoke of
something more impending in the
background.

The success of the Ninth quartet depends
on changes in energy and texturing. It is a
much more ‘symphonic’ work, often
making it difficult to believe that only four
voices were filling the hall so richly. The
subtle energy increases and decreases
were never overdone, and abrupt changes,
such as the sharp pizzacato chord out-
bursts in the fourth movement, were
capitalized upon to their fullest extent.

The Brahms Clarinet Quintet, which
stood as the only work on the second half of
the program, is probably the composer’s
finest, most profound chamber work. It
was a pure performance, and the blending
with Lesley Schatzberger’s clarinet was
exquisite.

Schatzberger’s solos in the Adagio
movement were forceful but not overly so,
and she utilized to its fullest extent the in-
bred ability of the clarinet to weave its
way in and out of the musical texture.
Some of the quintet’s interpretation was a
bit ‘‘thick,”’ but this is a quality inherent in
much of Brahms.

One becomes very conscious of the ac-
tual performance when watching the Fitz-
william Quartet. Subtle movements within
the group, as when two voices with similar
parts turn towards one another, add a
physical dimension that increases the uni-

FSQ: the ‘gents’ room’
approach in public halls

By AMY FORTGANG

Signs of the mutual admiration that the
Fitzwilliam String Quartet has established
with the University have been seen
throughout the first 13 days of their
residency here.

Although shorter than their previous
five-week visit in 1978, this period has a
closeness to it because of what Christopher
Rowland, the first violinist of the group,
calls ‘‘the relationships developed.”

These “relationships,” established two
years ago and maintained through both
long-distance communication and actual
visits to the quartet’s home in York,
England, Bucknell students and faculty
have left a ‘‘tremendous impression’’ on
the four men. ‘

Rowland, in an interview Tuesday with
the Bucknellian said, “‘We came here two
years ago and made many friends. When
you have that kind of relationship you want
to keep it up.’’ For this reason the four str-
ing players and Lesley Schatz-
berger—clarinetist and violist and Alan
George’s wife—were eager to return to the
University when they were approached
with the idea by James Hammerlee, direc-
tor of student activities and University
Center programs.

George commented on the ‘‘tremendous
response”’ the quartet received from the

audience assembled for their, concert Sun-

day. When the group walked onto the stage
in Rooke Chapel an ovation ensued that
caused them to take a bow before they had
even played the first piece.

“That sort of thing is really heartwarm-
ing,”’ George said, ‘“‘and comes only when
you have intimate contact with the people
in your audience, when you are more in-
volved with them.”

Involved is not the word. Hammerlee has
kept the five visitors on a round of recep-
tions, meetings and parties, an endless
“involvement’”’ with the University com-
munity that has them all suffering from
what cellist lan Davies affectionately calls
“Jim-lag.”’

“T love having tnem here,” one student
said. ‘‘They’re not like your typical artists.
When you talk to them they’re so human
and friendly. I was pleasantly surprised.”’
The openness of the quartet with students
was also noted by George.

“J was in the Gents’ room the other
day,” he said in illustration, ‘‘and I was
talking to a student. We remarked that all
barriers are broken down in here. I mean,
we’re just men. And then he seemed stunn-
ed when I continued to talk with him when
we got through the door of the Gents’ room
and into the hallway.”

It is this kind of interaction with students,
and with the public in general, that makes
the Fitzwilliam String Quartet as popular

as they are, as evidenced by their recen:

sae as HOLES

ty of sound. It is possible to follow changes
in melody and accompaniment simply by
watching.

On the other hand, none of the physical
elements of quartet playing — movement,
actual playing, style, or breathing — ever
intrude upon the purity of their music.

The Cleveland Quartet, believed to be
excellent interpreters of Bralims, breathe
so deeply and sharply at entrances that
this unwelcome noise is added to the
music. Breathing together is a device that
aids the quartet in keeping together, and
the Fitzwilliam has been ever conscious of
this.

There might be voiced only three objec-
tions to the overall performance. First, the
program was a bit on the “‘heavy”’ side.
The Brahms and the Shostakovich Ninth
are both “headliner” pieces that could
each anchor any program. One might
rather have heard something in the vein of
Mozart's delightful Clarinet Quintet than
the more intense Brahms work, which
seemed to intrude upon the profound effect
of the Shostakovich.

Secondly, first violinist Christopher
Rowland’s new violin seemed to be ex-

Page 17

periencing ‘‘growing pains.” Passage
work on the E string was at times tinny
and slightly off in intonation. Overall,
however, the new instrument increased,
the homogeneity of the quartet’s sound,
and is excellently suited to carrying the’
melody, especially in the middle registers.

Last, and most important, was the au-
dience’s feelings about the quartet. It is
vital to the appreciation and objective
judgment of a performance that the
listener take his seat with no preconceived
notion of how ‘‘great’’ the concert will be.
Sunday’s audience was “‘pre-sold’’ on the
Fitzwilliam.

There is nothing entirely wrong with
this, as their performance was in most
ways worthy of the audience’s praises, but
this anticipation of Performing Arts Series
events has become a bad Bucknell
habit. Remembering the Eugene Fodor
concert, which was little more than a
demonstration of technique and not music,
and the audience’s response to it, one wor-
ries that the campus will blindly accept
any performance placed before it without
being critically discerning.

The Fitzwilliam String Quartet (from left to right: Christopher Rowland, violin;
loan Davies, cello; Alan George, viola, and Jonathan Sparey, violin, has re-
turned to Bucknell for a second residency. The wish has been expressed by
members of the group that such visits become a regular event.

tion Sunday evening.

An unsolicited show of feeling and
regard, such as that elicited by their ap-
pearance in the Chapel, is not only “‘heart-
warming” but also gives the performers a
confidence that allows them to relax and
enjoy the presentation of their art, George
said.

“Actually,” Hammerlee joked, ‘the
quartet has been so well received that
we’re thinking of making this an annual
event.””

According to the members of the quartet
Hammerlee’s jest is less improbable than
it might at first seem to be.

“We would be very happy,” Rowland
said, ‘‘to return to Bucknell whenever our

schedule makes it at all possible.”
ea RRR EEE EERE

Kk AAARAR REL

Because the University system in England
works on a trimester basis, the only
available time for such a visit is in the ear-
ly fall.

Regardless of future plans, there is still
time left during the present residency to
see the group in action. The quartet will
perform as accompanists in Schatz-
berger’s innovative clarinet recital at 8:15
tonight in the University Center Forum.
They also have one more full-scale concert
scheduled. At 8:30 p.m. Monday, Oct. 6,
the Fitzwilliam String Quartet will present
their final performance of the year in
Rooke Chapel.

Their next public appearance will be
their debut at Carnegie Recital Hall, Oct.

‘Dressed to Kill’ stripped bare

By LYNNE RUTHERFORD

Combine a bored suburban wife with an insane,
sexually motivated killer and you get “Dressed to
Kill,” Brian De Palma’s graphic mixture of sex and
violence.

“Dressed To Kill” opens tonight at the Campus
Theatre on Market Street. Gaining a large following
and huge box office receipts mainly because of the
most famous shower scene since Hitchcock, this
film is a flawed, lurid, and often shocking
melodrama.

Angie Dickinson turns in one of her best screen
performances to date as Kate, a sexually
dissatisfied woman looking for excitement.
Through intelligently sparse dialogue and, more
often, skillful facial expressions, Dickinson is able
in a short period of time to establish a touching and
fully developed character.

The use of music and photography throughout
“Dressed To Kill” is superb, particularly during
Dickinson’s scenes. The best shot sequence of the
movie, a romp by Kate and a stranger through a
museum, is a study of control and subtle humor.
Even during the latter half of the film, played strict-
ly for chills, the music and photography remained
excellent.

Dickinson’s explicit shower scene and the
nature of her erotic fantasies have stirred a furor
among feminists that is unlikely to abate until the
movie ends its theatrical run. When her character,

Kate, is dispensed with, ‘‘Dressed To Kill” rapidly
degenerates into just another horror flick.

Although several suspenseful and well-placed
chills remain, the film, due to a poor screenplay,
fails to achieve its early potential. After an in-
telligent beginning, De Palma falls prey to laziness
and settles for thrills at the expense of well-
developed characterizations and a clear storyline.

Michael Caine is wasted. As Kate’s
psychiatrist, he is never given an opportunity to
develop his character, which remains threadbare
throughout the movie.

The camera lingers long over Nancy Allen, who
plays a high-priced prostitute, but her acting lacks
definition and purpose. Allen, who perhaps not coin-
cidentally is De Palma’s wife, produces a strained
and somewhat tedious performance. Unlike those of
Dickinson, her sexual scenes are tasteless and over-
done.

Undoubtedly the worst thing in the picture is the
horribly contrived and overwritten role of a tough
city cop. Likewise, the role of Kate’s teenage genius
son is one dimensional.

The film’s conclusion, wherein all the
characters are pulled Agatha Christie-like into one
room, just fails to put together all the hows and
whys of the killer. But for an old-fashioned scare,
without too much thought as to what is plausible or
not, ‘Dressed to Kill’ will suffice.

John Houseman, actor, will lecture

Erick Hawkins troupe
sets mixed responses

By AMY FORTGANG

Erick Hawkins, dancer and
choreographer, brought his
dance troupe here Tuesday and
Wednesday for a series of lec-
tures, demonstrations and
master classes, culminating each
night with a full-length per-
formance in Coleman Theater.

Hawkins’ theory of dance per-
formance is that the audience
should not watch the costumes or
scenery but the movement of the
dancers’ bodies. The
knowledgeable viewer will swift-
ly ascertain that Hawkins’ ap-
proach to dance is not merely
training, but a way of life. No
skinny, undernourished dancers
for him. One gets an impression
of extreme good health and ex-
cellent physical condition.

His dancers, all trained at a
feed-in school in New York City in
accordance with his own special
standards that emphasize fluidi-
ty, have strict control of their
bodies, and in performance can
move smoothly together as one
unit.

In a master class Wednesday
afternoon, Hawkins vehemently
stated that “‘costumes, scenery

: < Se ore gc

and story-line should not intrude
into the contemplation of the ac-
tual dance.”

Through Wednesday night’s
performance he both affirmed
and denied that stand.

The evening’s program opened
with ‘“‘Agathlon,” performed by
all eight of the company
members on a stage bereft of
scenery except for a free-
standing modern sculpture.
Multi-colored leotards set off the
primary hues of the set-piece and
allowed the audience to see
minute body movement.

A celebration of Hawkins’
ideals, the piece permitted no
outside influences to distract
from the non-storied
choreography, though subtle and
lightning-quick costume changes
somewhat undermined the basic
premise and seemed to serve no
purpose.

One anticipated more of the
same pure dance, but in the se-
cond piece — ‘Plains Daybreak”
— Hawkins began to deviate from
his own lines by portraying
animals and man at the beginn-
ing of the world.

aided in the identification of
creatures and each dancer show-
ed the essence of his role through
repetition of characteristic
movements.

Hawkins, making his initial ap-
pearance of the evening as the
First Man, did not have the
lightness and total control that he
demands of his dancers. His
movements were less sharply
defined and one got the idea that
any of his corps members could
have performed the role with
more professionalism.

It might be debated that
Hawkins was hoping to convey
the clumsiness of man in com-
parison to the grace of animals.
This argument could be accep-
table had the same problem not
occurred again in the last
number, which played to a much-
emptied house.

Despite an excellent comedic
performance by Craig Nazor as
Parson Weems, ‘‘Parson Weems
and the Cherry Tree, Etc.”” was
essentially an over-cutesy por-
trayal of the famous George
Washington - and - the - cherry -
tree legend.

One would assume that, with
his own orchestra at hand to play
written-to-order music and with
the highly talented lighting
designer he has in Robert
Engstrom, Hawkins would utilize
his uniquely trained dancers to
promote his own dance theories
in the form of pure dance presen-
tations. Judging from Wednes-
day’s performance, he does much
better when he stays away from
stories, and concentrates on
bodies and their movements and
interactions. —

University art collection
undergoing inventory in
anticipation of exhibit

By ROBIN MEREDITH

The University’s Permanent Collection of fine art for the first time
is undergoing a complete inventory, according to Andrea Hinds, direc-
tor of the Center Gallery.

“Our goal is to write a catalogue of all the works owned by
Bucknell so we know what we have and can utilize it,” Hinds said.

The compilation will result in an illustrated listing of each piece of
art and its history.

Pam Feir, a graduate assistant, and Susan Carr ’81 are aiding
Hinds in the creation of the reference system, which she calls an ongo-
ing process that will never be fully completed. All available informa-
tion about each work—including an identification number and date of
acquisition—will be included.

The sources of most of the art are private collections of people con-
nected with the University, although there are some pieces purchased
by the University.

Because the collection is distributed throughout the cam-
pus—much of it on display in the Kress Gallery at the Ellen Clark Ber-
trand Library—there will be a central file detailing the location of
each item and recording when and where it is moved, thereby forming
a “‘system of control.”’

The filing and cataloguing will be useful to students who wish to
study the collection by making it possible for them to know the
whereabouts and history of any piece before research is begun, Hinds
said.

If the University ever forms a museum, she added, the collection
will be in readiness. Some categories of the collection—for example,
the large number of prints in storage—can be used in art classes as
well.

Among items uncovered were two high-quality paintings by
Prendergast, now on display in the library, an American impres-
sionist from the early 20th century, and works by other well-known
American artists, including George Inness.

The inventory is not a matter of simply documenting each item.
Discovery is followed by research to trace the history of the piece in a
continuing process that seeks to erase the labels of ‘‘Unidentified Ar-
tist”’ and “Unidentified Title.”

The paintings of the Kress Gallery, including a portrait attributed
to the famous painter Tintoretto, have already been catalogued, but
The Permanent Collection does not consist solely of paintings. It in-
cludes furniture, prints and large Japanese collections.

The highlight of the inventory process will be a display of selec-
tions from the finer works of The Permanent Collection in the Center
Gallery. The exhibit is scheduled for January.

Coffeehouse slate completed:
First act will be ‘Spiritwood’

By DAVID BLACKMAN

The Coffeehouse organization,
under the management of Rob
Guimento ’81 and assistant
manager Sue Dettbarn ’81, opens
tomorrow night in the University
Center Forum.

Long an outlet for campus
talent as well as quality outside
performers, the Coffeehouse is an
integral element of student enter-
tainment, running Wednesday
dinner shows and weekend pro-
grams.

This year 25 acts auditioned for
only eight weekend slots.

“The competition was stiff and
the decisions were difficult to
make,” Guimento said. ‘We
were extremely pleased to see so
many promising fresh acts to go
with the remaining consistent
quality of our more experienced
groups,” he said.

When asked what standards
they used for judging the acts,
Guimento and Dettbarn cited
sound quality as the top priority
followed by stage presence and
the performers’ ability to enter-
tain an audience for an entire
show.

Claiming their schedule is
“strong and able to satisfy all
tastes,’ the management of the
Coffeehouse presents a plethora
of events for the entertainment-
seeking campus community.

Beginning the season on Satur-
day with two shows is the return-
ing off-campus group ‘“‘Spirit-
wood.”’ Featuring original folk
ballads accompanied by a-
coustic guitar, this popular hus-
band and wife team will perform
in the forum at 8 and 9:30 p.m.

The next Coffeehouse, Friday,
Oct. 10, at 9 p.m., is in conjunc-
tion with the Homecoming ac-
tivities and will be held in Davis
Gym to accommodate the ex-
pected large turnout. This special
program will include the talents
of Bucknell alumni Bob and Bill
Grabowski, The John Roll Band
and Jonathan Sprout, all per-
forming original works.

Parents Weekend, Oct. 17 and
18, returns the Coffeehouse to its
familiar home in the University
Center Cave for two per-
formances nightly at 8 and 10

Odell, Bucknellians Jessica Huff

present a repetoire to include the
familiar sounds of Joni Mitchell.

Oct. 31 and Nov. 1 will find the
cave rocking to the highly re-
garded sounds of the hit band
Interface. Arriving on the
Bucknell scene last year, this
band is recognized by its distinct
rock sound.

On Nov. 7 and 8, two more acts
of past success return to the cave.
The new Encore returns with a
repetoire of less Broadway tunes
and more rock-and-roll. Along
with Encore, the vocal talent of
Jackie Krull ’83, will be
spotlighted.

Nov. 14 and 15 marks the return
of Bluejeans, with their smooth,
mellow light-rock sound. Also on
the bill is an as yet unnamed
group which includes the talents
of John Goodman ’81, John
Caldwell ’82 and Rich Cieciuch
81.

The last Coffeehouse of the
semester is scheculed for Nov. 21
and 22 and will feature the light-
hearted sounds of Professors
Brockhaus and Hochberg, and
The Merely Intentional Band.
Also appearing will be guitarist
Steve Good 81.

In the words of the manage-
ment, ‘It promises to be a great
season.”

against Columbia. Eleven Bucknell runners finished before the

By ROBBY STETZ
and JEFF CROSS

The men’s cross country team
edged Columbia 25-32 Saturday,
stretching their six-year
unbeaten streak to an incredible
65 straight meets.

The race featured a tough,
four-way battle for first place
between Bisons Steve Bigotto ’82
and Bill Reifsnyder ’84, and Lion
runners Charles Miers and Mike
O’Brien. The four harriers main-
tained a tight pack in front of the
field until they neared the three-
mile mark, where Bigotto broke
away.

Reifsnyder stayed close and
eventually pulled ahead, break-
ing the tape in 25:29.1, the second-
best time ever by a Bison

freshman on the 5.15 mile circuit.
Reifsnyder was the Pennsylvania
high school champion last year.

Bigotto finished second with a
time of 25:55, followed by Lions
Miers and O’Brien at 25:57 and
25:59, respectively.

A total of eleven Bucknell har-
riers finished before the fifth Col-
umbia man came home.

Among those were freshmen
Jeff Hines (7th place), John
Leary (llth), Mike Deckert
(12th), and Tom Richardson
(14th).

The best performance by the
Bison tri-captains was the 16th
place finish by Jim O’Shea ’81.
Mike Debraggio placed 21st and
Rick Sayre ’82 dropped out after
being trampled following a fall.

Lock Haven defeats
field hockey by 3-1

The Bison field hockey team
dropped its second match of the
season, a 3-1 decision at Lock
Haven State College on Thurs-
day.

The stickers fell behind the
Division I Golden Eagles 2-0 at
the half. Both goals resulted from
powerful drives off penalty cor-
ners, according to co-captain
Anne Kennedy ’82. Lock Haven
tallied a third goal midway
through the second half against
Betsy Doyle ’82, who earlier
saved a Golden Eagle penalty
stroke.

The Bisons’ second half ag-
gressiveness finally paid off
when freshman Nancy Dill
scored the first Bucknell goal of
the campaign, with an assist to
Kennedy. The Bison rally was
short-lived, however; and the
Golden Eagles were victorious.

Doyle had 13 saves while
Bucknell could only manage
eight shots at the Lock Haven
net.

Coach Sally Starr noted the fine
play of senior co-captain Jill
Henry on defense, Jeanne
Minahan ’83 at link and Dill at
forward.

The Bisons have until next
Saturday to prepare for Ithaca
College, a team that defeated
Bucknell 3-0 last season and was
second ranked in New York state.

Mudsharks split two

By JEFF CROSS

The Mudsharks, the men’s
ultimate frisbee team, hosted
Penn State and the Jersey Jolt
Jast Saturday to open their fall
season.

Bucknell began the afternoon
with an easy 19-5 victory over
Penn State. The Mudsharks were
clearly the superior team and
have consistently defeated the
Lions in the past. Spokesman Mel
Bayo ’81 commented that ‘‘our
zone defense worked very well”
in allowing only five goals.

After only 15 minutes’ rest,
the Mudsharks were back in ac-
tion against the Jolt, a combina-

tion of Bucknell alumni, the
Knights of Nee, and Glassboro
State, the defending national
champions.

The ’Sharks fell behind early
due to inexperience and many
turnovers. Despite holding their
own against the Jolt offense inthe
second half, the deficit was too
much to overcome and the Mud-
sharks fell, 21-13.

In the day’s final game, Jersey
crushed Penn State.

The Mudsharks will be back in
action Saturday in Mercerville,
New Jersey, as they challenge
the University of Pennsylvania,

Women’s X-country
seeks improvement

By JAN BALAKIAN

“We expect the team to score much better than ast year,”’ said
second-year runner Laura Gaydos ’83 of Saturday’s Penn State In-
vitational, The Bisons finished a disappointing eighth last year out
of a field of ten but Gaydos believes the Bison women’s cross coun-
try squad was overwhelmed by the size of such schools as Cornell
and the University of Maryland, the latter of which gives athletic
scholarships to many of its athletes.

Last season the women harriers turned in an impressive 6-1
record but this year will be without the services of Ann Bischoff, the
outstanding Bison captain who graduated last spring.

The returning upperclassmen have all bettered their times con-
siderably, however, and their times are greatly improved because
of more challenging practices. “This year most of the runners are
fairly equal in ability and as a result practices are more com-
petitive,” Gaydos said.

Coach Dianne Ware also expressed enthusiasm over the poten-
tial of the freshmen, citing Karen Flanigan, Nancy Nelson, Patty
Reilly and Judie Olson as the names to look for.

Gaydos believes Saturday’s confrontation at Penn State will be
an unusual challenge because the women will have to contend with
a four-mile race rather than the three-mile course to which they are
accustomed. “It will be difficult for us to pace ourselves,” she said.

Ware expects the Bisons’ toughest competition to come from
Penn State, West Chester, Shippensburg and Temple.

7th at West Point

Golfers disappoint

By JEFF CROSS
The men’s golf team opened its
fall season last weekend with a
seventh place finish at the West
Point Invitational tournament.

Temple University won the
two-day tournament by out-
shooting the 22 team field with an
aggregate score of 586. Bucknell
lagged behind with a 612 total.

In a playoff for individual
honors, Kevin Klier of Temple
defeated Dave Carnevale of
James Madison with a birdie on
the first extra hole. Klier’s total
was 69-71-140.

The Bisons’ aspirations were
dashed when Kevin High 82
dislocated his shoulder on his
first swing of the opening round.
He nevertheless managed to

ishoot a courageous round of 84
before dropping out of the tourna-
ment. High shot an impressive 69
in an earlier practice round.

Bill Francis ’83 was the leading
Bison golfer as he tied for 13th
place with 75-76-151. Dave
Richards ’81 was close behind by
shooting 78-75-153.

Rob Wagner ’81 and Rick
Kramer ’83 tied with 77-77-154 and
73-81-154 totals, respectively.

Coach Jeff Ranck was disap-
pointed in the team’s showing
and hopes the scores will improve
this weekend. The Bisons will get
more major tournament ex-
posure at the Yale Fall Inter-
collegiate tournament in New
Haven, Connecticut. A strong
field is expected for Thursday’s
opening round.

NFC picks: 3-way toss-up

By BOB DAVIS and JEFF CROSS
Following last week’s AFC picks, we present
our equally dazzling predictions for the National
Football Conference.

NFC EAST

To many fans the retirement of legandary
quarterback Roger Staubach signalled the end of
the Dallas dynasty, but replacement Danny White

ould be ready to take command after several
seasons as understudy. The return of Ed ‘“‘Too Tall”
Jones restores the Cowboys’ ‘‘Doomsday Defense”’
to past prowess.

Dick Vermeil’s Philadelphia Eagles are finally
read to challenge the best of the NFL. A solid
defense and a potent offense led by Ron Jaworski,
Harold Carmichael and Wilbur Montgomery, plus a
year of experience will make the Eagles a Super
Bowl threat. .

Washington always seems to be in the race
despite a timeworn defense and offense of cast-offs
led by quarterback Joe Theismann. This year will
be no different for the Redskins.

A lack of players of the caliber of all-pro '

linebacker Brad Van Pelt leave the Giants with a
deficient defense. Quarterback Phil Simms at-
tempts to move an offense that lacks a solid running
game.

The playoff flame began to flicker in St. Louis
several years ago and has since gone out. Running
back Otis Anderson alone does not have the spark to
relight the Cardinals.

NFC CENTRAL
John McKay’s Tampa Bay team will prove that
last year’s banner season was no fluke. Quarter-
back Doug Williams and powerful backs Ricky Ball
and Jerry Eckwood lead the offense, while Leroy

Selmon anchors the Buccaneer defense, the NFL’s
best in 1979.

Former Oklahoma sensation Billy Sims should
provide the offense punch needed to lift Detroit out
of the NFC cellar. The Lions may still be a couple of
players away from a playoff berth.

Walter Payton’s talent will keep the Chicago
Bears in the running in the NFC’s weakest division.

Minnesota will try to regain past glory with the
talented Tommy Kramer at the helm. The Vikings’
young defense is bolstered by veteran linebackers
Jeff Siemon and Matt Blair.

Green Bay’s championship days are a faded
memory. Bart Starr’s young and promising
Packers are still a few years from respectability.

NFC WEST

The Rams’ biggest obstacle on their way to yet
another division title is how to please the fans they
left behind in Los Angeles. With two quality quarter-
backs in Pat Haden and Vince Ferragamo, a pierc-
ing offensive thrust and a stingy defense, the Rams
could be on their way to another Super Bowl.

San Francisco hopes Thomas ‘‘Hollywood”
Henderson will give the Forty-Niners the talent to
challenge in the west. Steve Debery and Paul Hofer
are offensive leaders.

After years of mediocrity, New Orlenas may
have finally built a winner. Archie Manning, Chuck
Muncie, and Wes Chandler will power the Saints’
high scoring offense.

The Falcons, a playoff team two seasons ago,
have slipped considerably since. Steve Bartkowski,
Wally Francis, and rookie Junior Miller are bright
spots on Atlanta’s offense.

In the playoffs, look for the Rams to topple the
Eagles for a return meeting with the Steelers in the
Super Bowl. We'll leave that contest up to you.

UConn buries the Herd, 38-7

By STEVEN SKOLNICK
and MICHAEL SUAREZ

The Bisons were neither
outclassed nor intimidated in
their 38-7 loss to the University of
Connecticut Huskies last Satur-
day. They were outplayed.

The after noon began well for
the Herd in their first contest of
the season. After losing the toss,
Ken Durr ’82 booted the opening
kickoff deep into the UConn end-
zone. Husky running back Joe
Addison returned Durr’s kick to
his own 24 where he fumbled.
Sophomore Glen MacGibbon
recovered for Bucknell.

A Geoff Gallo ’82 run into the
middle followed by a 17-yard
touchdown strike from quarter-
back Al Locey ’83 to Ken Jenkins
’82 put the Herd on the board

first. Junior Bill Grennon’s point-
after was good. Score: Bisons 7,
UConn 0. Total time elapsed: 52
seconds.

It was easy; perhaps too easy.
“J thought that the first score was
too quick, too fast,’’ commented
Head Coach Bob Curtis.

The crowd of 7,670 Huskie fans
watched in quiet disbelief as Durr
prepared to kick off a second
time. The silence at Memorial
Stadium in Storrs quickly turned
to screaming, however, as UConn
drove deep into Bison territory.
The drive stalled when
linebacker Pat Paro ’82 came up
with a Huskie fumble, saving at
least 3 points for the Herd.

Several exchanges followed
before Locey, the talented but in-
experienced quarterback, threw

the first of his four interceptions
of the afternoon.

The Huskies then took ad-
vantage by quickly, advancing in-
to field goal range. A facemask
penalty against Bucknell ac-
counted for a good portion of
UConn’s yardage.

Two plays later Bob Segar split
the uprights on a 40 yard kick
which cut the Bison’s lead to 7-3.

The second quarter opened
with another exchange of posses-
sion. Faced with a third-and-nine
situation on his own 26 yard line,
UConn quarterback Ken Sweitzer
dropped back to pass.

In what was probably the
Bisons’ most outstanding defen-
sive play of the game, outside
linebacker Jeff Miller ’82 in-

pheronslenninoseniigb
Ken Durr ‘82 shows his punting form in Thursday's practice.
Durr's 41.3-yard average was one of the few bright spots in

tercepted the ball in a crowd but
was quickly brought down.

The Herd was unable to
capitalize, however, as Gren-
non’s 36-yard field goal attempt
was blocked.

Sweitzer then led the Huskies
on a nine-play, 80 yard scoring
drive capped by a 13-yard
touchdown toss to Joe Markus.

The remainder of the second
quarter was characterized by
poor execution and frequent er-
rors by both teams. Bucknell
fumbled three times, recovering
once, while Locey threw his se-
cond interception. The Bisons
managed to get the ball back
twice on interceptions by defen-
sive backs Doug Smoot ’82 and
Jim Gush ’81.

Although his team trailed 10-7
at the half, Coach Curtis felt that
“dt was anybody’s ballgame.”

The events of the third quarter
proved to be crucial to the con-
test. Halfway through the period
Sweitzer spotted a hole in the

Grieb cites teamwork and spirit
as crucial to volleyball success =

By LOUISE BRISTOL

There is nowhere to go but up for the women’s
volleyball team. After finishing their third varsity
season at 4-12, coach Terrie Grieb feels the team
will be much improved.

Grieb is enthusiastic about the upcoming season,
stating, “We could do well if we learn to play
together. We don’t communicate enough yet and we
need to work on control.”

Only two players were lost to graduation and the
freshmen are promising, leading Grieb to comment
that, ‘‘We have much more ability on the court than
in the past.”

Returning starters are captain Susan Bairstow ’81
and Katie Hale ’83. Bairstow is an outstanding hitter
in her fourth year on the squad. Hale and freshman
Laura Medalie will both play regularly and are still
battling for the starting setter spot.

Joining Medalie as the only starting freshman
will be Kathleen Eckert.

Jeanne Groeneveld ’83, who is making the switch
from field hockey to volleyball, will also start. Ac-
cording to Grieb, she is an excellent all-around
player who competed in the Empire State Games in
New York this summer.

Also expected to see varsity action are Sue Atkin-
son ’81, Denise Cohen ’83 and Janet Rankin ’84.
Atkinson was abroad last fall but played as a
sophomore and Cohen is a first year member of the
team who played for the women’s softball team last
spring. Rankin “has shown a lot of hustle’’ in prac-
tice sessions, according to Grieb.

The other women competing for the final spots
are junior Carolyn Weeks, sophomores Ann
Novasatka, Carol Schmidt and Alison Wellington,
and freshman Karen Tarnow.

Seniors Nina Kaminsky and Laura Kinney and
freshman Kathleen Spear are all presently injured.

The spikers open their season Saturday at Juniata
with a tri-meet against Juniata College and Clarion
State College.

Juniata, a tall and quick team, has beaten the
Bisons for the past two years. Clarion State is ex-
pected to be strong with many physical education
majors in the lineup.

Bairstow expects the Bisons to do well, noting that
“we have a lot more power than last year.” Grieb
adds, ‘‘they’re all fighters so I expect we’ll have a
good season.”

against Slippery Rock.

After the Bisons held for two
plays, UConn set up in a passing
formation with 12 men on the
field. Bison coach Gene Depew
spotted the infraction from the
press box, but with the phones
dead, he was unable to relay his
message to the officials.

Sweitzer threw a 20 yard pass
to Rusty Umberger on the Bison
two yard line. No flag was thrown
on the play.

Thirty seconds later the Bisons
were on the short end of a 17-7
score.

Curtis called it ‘‘the play that
turned the tide. That was the ball
game right there. We had a
tremendous letdown right at that
point.”

With the momentum in their
favor, the Huskies dominated the
remainder of the game, scoring
three more touchdowns in the
final period.

The story of the Bison’s defeat
is the fact that their total time of
possession amounted to less than
24 minutes. Curtis commented,
“You just can’t keep the defense
on the field for that much time.”

The Huskies exploited ‘‘a
definite weakness in the middle
of the defense” while utilizing an
effective passing game.

Several key Bison personnel
left the game with injuries while
some others played with an acute
virus. Moreover, six turnovers on
first down thwarted the Bison of-
fensive effort.

Curtis concluded, ‘“‘We were not
as ready physically and mentally
as we should have been.”

The football team will face Slip-
pery Rock State College in their
home opener tomorrow at 1:30
p.m. The contest will mark the
first-ever meeting of the two
teams. For a preview, see page

John Zeller dismissed “with cause” two members of the
security staff here Friday. He refused to explain what

prompted his action.

were ‘‘dismissed for cause’’ Fri-
day, according to Vice President
for Administration and Finance

Zeller further refused com-
ment on his reasons for firing
Strunk and Gross.

The two security officers were
given the opportunity to resign or
be discharged, according to
Zeller. Gross and Strunk were

Report says bookstore like a

drugstore; poor selection cited

By DAVID HAWKINGS
and MADELON HENEHAN
Alterations in the physical ap-

pearance and management
policies at the University
Bookstore have begun following
publication of a report calling
for the store to change its “Rea
and Derick” appearance.

Besides criticizing the store’s
look as similar to the drugstore
chain, the report by The Book-
store Advisory Committee also
ask the University administration
to help remedy the situation by
making a “financial commit-
ment” of $30,000 annually to
improve the book department at
the store—especially its collec-
tion of “quality” books in
academic disciplines.

The yearly purchase of these
books—which are traditional
money losers—should be absor-
bed by a decrease in the rent
the store pays the University for

space in the University Center.

The publication by the com-
mittee, a six-member faculty
group chaired by Assistant
Professor of Classics Barbara
Shailor, was made public Sept. 8
but was originally sent to
University President Dennis
O’Brien in March.

While the faculty’s principal
criticism of the store both in
general and in the report has
been an inadequate book depart-
ment, students’ complaints have
traditionally been the fear of
being “ripped off.”

“As far as we can see,” said
Associate Professor of English
and committee member Philip
Withim, “this has never been
the case.”

The finds of the report agree
with the results of an_ in-
vestigation by the Bucknellian
in March of the bookstore’s
financial procedures.

It was the long-standing criti-
cism from the faculty that
prompted O’Brien to create the
special committee, members said.

They published as an appen-
dix a list of 13 complains about
the store which members said
“have been heard around the
store for 20 years.”

A chief faculty complaint was
the “emphasis on entertainment,
best-sellers, science fiction
mysteries and write-in yourself
books at $5 each,” the publica-
tion said.

“There’s just too much plain
junk” at the bookstore, it said.

University Bookstore Manager
Warren Elze said this week the
committee and faculty “must
realize this is a bookstore and
not a library. The store is not
for the faculty.”

But Shailor said in a separate
interview the bookstore “should

Dunlop, ABS president John
Dzurinko ’81, and four members
of the Bucknellian editorial
board. The 5 p.m. meeting lasted
53 minutes.

Shortly after 5 p.m., Zeller, ina
telephone conversation with Bell,
verified that neither of the securi-
ty officers had offered their
resignations.

“Tt’s official, that’s it’? Zeller
said. Having not received their
resignations, Zeller discharged
them.

Chief of Security Norman Fine
said the two patrolmen had
resigned. Fine said he had
nothing to do with the ‘‘resigna-
tions” and was ‘‘completely in
the dark’’ about the matter.

“The entire matter is confiden-
tial,”’ Fine said. ‘‘I don’t want to
hurt the individuals.”’

Zeller told Gross there were
complaints filed against Strunk
and him, according to Gross. The
complaints were in the form of
signed statements against the
two officers and were made by
some ‘“‘other people’ at the
University, he said.

The administration here con-
sists of ‘‘anti-union fanatics, and
they’ll stop at nothing. Absolutely
nothing,”’ Gross said. He said the
recent unionization of the securi-
ty officers with the United Plant

Guard Workers of America
(UPGWA) precipitated his and
Strunk’s dismissals.

Zeller said this had ‘absolutely
nothing”’ to do with the matter,
however. “If anything, the union
served to delay rather than to
precipitate”’ the firings of the two
men, he said. He refused to
discuss the matter in further
detail.

Gross had no comment about
the identity of the person or per-
sons who signed the statements
which he claims Zeller said
forced his dismissal. Zeller re-
fused to comment on the matter.

Strunk—the other patrolman
fired Friday—said he had re-
signed. He said his actions were a
result of “basically union pro-
paganda’”’ and that he had turned
his resignation in to Bell, Zeller,
and Fine.

Strunk refused to comment
because of ‘extenuating cir-
cumstances.”

Gross had been on the security
force since 1974, and now said he
is “better off not working for
Bucknell.’’ He said he does not
plan to initiate litigation against
the University, and that he will
“just find another job.”

Zeller said the University,
likewise, has no plans to initiate
litigation against Strunk or
Gross, for any reason. He said

Swim-a-thon marks start

of 1980 Greek Weekend 3

By DAVID O’CONNELL

Greek Weekend 1980 has already seen
two events occur, with the main
festivities tomorrow.

This is the second year Greek Week-
end has been held in its current format.
Co-sponsored by the Interfraternity and
Panhellenic Councils, the purpose of
Greek Weekend is to raise money for
chairty as well as to provide a good time
for students, according to Donn Zacune
°81, publicity chairman of the IFC.

Thursday night{s Swim-for-Cancer
resulted in nearly $2,000 in pledges. Sixty
swimmers, nearly twice the number who
participated last year, entered the event.
Fifteen teams were entered, representing
fraternities, sororities and six freshmen
halls.

Teams competed on the basis of total
money pledged, and the winners received
extra points towards the overall cham-
pionship.

Winning teams in the event were first,
Kappa Kappa Gamma, 40 points; second,
Delta Delta Delta, 30 points and third,
Phi Kappa Psi, 20 points. Each entering
team received 10 points.

Wednesday night’s Greek Weekend
banner contest saw 10 entries, each of

whom received six points. Judges named
Pi Beta Phi’s banner as the winner and
awarded 20 points. Second was Phi
Gamma Delta and Beta Gamma, who
split 14 points, and Sigma Alpha Mu
took 10 points for their third place entry.

Saturday’s main event will be the car-
nival to be held on the freshman quad
from 9:30 a.m. to 1 p.m..Zacune esti-
mated there will be 17 carnival booths
operated by various teams. Thirty
organizations are participating in Greek
Weekend in some form, he said.

Proceeds from the carnical and from a
six-mile road race also being held Satur-
day will benefit the Listening Post, a

counseling service at Lewisburg High §

School. “We hope to raise at least 25
percent of their budget needs,” Zacune
said.

Five competitive events to be held on
Swartz field from 1:15 to 3 p.m. will
round out the point scoring activities. An
overall trophy will be awarded tomorrow
night during the band party, to be held
on the Phi Kappa Psi field.

Student leaders seeking academic credit

By STEVE HABETZ

Officers for the ABS are seeking academic
credits for the duties they perform and the
student government leaders are also looking
for students to fill two new paid positions in
the ABS.

“We're looking for maybe two academic
credits per year,” said ABS President John
Dzurinko ’81. ‘‘We feel that this is justifiable
when you take into consideration the time in-
volved, the nature of the activity and the
potential impact as far as benefit for the en-
tire Bucknell community,” he added.

Dzurinko said that, “the program could be
supplemented with readings pertinent to the
issues or subject matter handled by each of-
ficer. For example, the treasurer could be
given readings on finance. This type of pro-
gram could become a practical vehicle for
conveying theory for the student to learn. We
think this would better prepare students for

similar work in the future.”

Dzurinko would like to see academic credits
made available for students filling the ABS of-
fices of president, vice president and
treasurer.

Two paid positions are also now being of-

- fered by the ABS:publicity director and inter-

collegiate coordinator. The ABS currently has
one paid employee, a part-time secretary.

The addition of the two jobs will involve an
expenditure of about $700 a year, but
Dzurinko said, ‘‘We see the benefits far
outweighing the expense.”

The jobs will be paid for out of ABS funds
which originate from the student activities
fee.

The duties of the publicity director,
Dzurinko said, ‘‘will include informing
students of opportunities available through
student government, putting together an ex-

planatory pamphlet on the ABS tor tne admis-
sions office and making press releases, in ad-
dition to standard publicity.”

The inter-collegiate coordinator, ‘‘will be in
charge of sharing new ideas with student
associations at other schools in an effort to
improve the ABS and become more involved
with the national student movement,”
Dzurinko said.

The jobs are available to anyone on student
aid and will pay minimum wage. Dzurinko, in
explaining the advantages of creating paid
positions, said that “many students who
would be interested in doing this type of work
are working in the cafeteria and bookstore in
order to meet their financial obligations to the
University. We felt that by adding the finan-
cial incentive we would get a larger selection
and be able to find the persons most suited for
the positions.”

Student bicyclist struck
while crossing Route 15

By LISA CERUTI

Mary McNerney ’81 was struck
by a car Tuesday night while
riding her bicycle across Route 15
at Moore Ave. She suffered a
skull fracture and is reported to
be in serious condition in the in-
tensive care unit of Geisinger
Medical Center.

The accident occurred at 8:45
p.m. as McNerney crossed from
the east side of Route 15 toward
the mods. The light was red for
cars travelling on Route 15. One
car was stopped at the light when
William Belsky of Lewisburg,
driving a 1976 Granada, ap-
proached the intersection and hit
McNerney while she was in the
crosswalk.

An ambulance was called from
the scene of the accident and ar-
rived within minutes, followed by
Campus Security and East Buf-
falo Township police. McNerney
was taken to Evangelical Com-
munity Hospital for treatment of
severe head injuries and later
transported to the Geisinger

Medical Center in Danville for
more extensive care.

Norman Fine, Chief of Campus
Security, said that upon his ar-
rival, McNerney showed no signs
of paralysis. Fine commented
that ‘‘ambulance response was
excellent.”

According to John Dunlop,
dean of student affairs, who was
called to the accident site, the ac-
cident appeared to be the driver’s
fault. Dunlop described Belsky as
“an older gentleman” and said
that he ‘“‘allegedly ran the red
light.”

Capt. Auten of the East Buffalo
Township Police Department
stated that the accident ‘‘was not
deliberate.”’ Belsky was cited for
a traffic signal violation and
fined $25 plus $10 in costs. In addi-
tion, McNerney was cited for fail-

be similar in many respects to a
library by servicing the intellec-
tual needs.”

Elze also denounced the 13-
point list of criticisms, calling it
“trash and nonsense.”

He denied the store had what
the Shailor committee called
“inadequate academic and
scholarly trade stock” and “poor
displaying of various academic
disciplines of literature.”

The report was not objective
and did not have “enough con-
structive ideas to make it
valuable,” Elze said.

To help solve problems not
yet rectified at the
store—especially another com-
plaint of inadequate art supplies,
classical records and scores and
“inadequate knowledge of art,
music and literature on the part

of the staff, including top
management”—O’Brien in June
appointed Associate Professor of
Music Jackson Hill as a faculty
liaison with the bookstore.

Hill will also institute a
system of representatives from
each academic department to
pick titles for a “new” book
department at O’Brien’s request.

He is also expected to issue
his own “memo”, this week
listing another set of recom-
mendations for improvement.

the “cosmetic
changes” the 16-page report
called for were instituted this
summer as part of the effort to
change what the committee
called the “mall, boutique” at-
mosphere to one “appropriate for
a strong institution of learning
and education.

Committee asks study aid ban

The removal

of all Monarch and Cliff Note publications was one

of the many suggestions made by The Bookstore Advisory Commit-
tee in their March report that was made public two weeks ago.

The report said these study aids are

parents.”
Despite this suggestion,

“shoddy items” that “make
affect visiting faculty and

study notes have continued to be
displayed on the bookstore‘s shelves this fall,

and Warren Elze said

he has no plans to discontinue their sale.

“If teachers assume the only purpose

for this condensed material

is to cheat,” the manager said, “their reasoning is very narrow.”

Bookstore Committee Chairman

Barbara Shailor feels “very

srongly” these items should not be sold and will continue an effort

to see they are removed.

The drugstore portion of the
store, formerly at the entrance,
was transposed with the gift sec-
tion, the record department and
certain bookshelves were moved,
the white walls were painted
blue and the “institutional”
white lighting was made “war-
mer” to make the store “less
sterile looking,” according to
Elze.

Elze said he had been “toying
with these ideas”—all of which
were specified in the report—for
the past three years.

“This may be true,” Shailor
said, adding she hoped her
committee’s work would “push
forward” the other changes
asked for as well.

More physical renovation will
take place this spring, when all
other shelf space is to be
remodelled to make book-buying
more “enjoyable.”

Other faculty members on the
committee are Professors of
Chemistry William Cooper and

Lectureship sponsors‘J ustice’symposium

Wooden speaks on children’s
rights in final ‘Justice’ lecture

By TRICIA KENNEDY

Ken Wooden, speaking in the
Vaughan Literature Auditorium
Thursday night, raised the ques-
tion, “Who shall plead for the
helpless?”

Wooden’s lecture, entitled,
“Justice for Children: A Time
for Advocacy,” was the last in a
symposium on “Justice in
America” sponsored by the
Bucknell Student Lectureship
Committee.

Wooden is the author of
Weeping in the Playtime of
Others, a book which deals with
the subject of child advocacy.

In addition, Wooden has
worked for several years in-
vestigating juvenile justice as a
reporter for CBS “Sixty Min-
utes” and NBC News. He is
now a special correspondent for
the Chicago Sun Times.

Thursday’s lecture was sparse-
ly attended. Its subject was the
exploitation of juveniles by the
USS. legal system. Wooden called

for legislation to protect the
rights of so-called “status offen-
ders”—juveniles who are run-
aways, truants, or are simply
considered to be “incorrigible”
by their parents and the courts.

Wooden named several instan-
ces of abuse he has uncovered
as a reporter investigating reform
schools across the country.

In one Texas institution,
Wooden said children were put
in solitary confinement for steal-
ing crackers, or “acting up” in
class. Often gas cannisters were
rolled into the cells to “calm”
the children.

Such offenses continue to oc-
cur, Wooden said, because of a
lack of “adult interest and com-
mitment in juvenile justice.” He
blamed politicians in particular
for ignoring the issue of in-
stitutional reform, claiming that
most of them are more con-
cerned with the advancement of
their careers than with child
welfare.

Wooden said that conditions
in retirement homes are given
top priority by politicians be-
cause the elderly tend to have a
high voter turnout. “Kids do not

vote.” he noted,
Corruption in state govern-

ment is stalling reform in the
juvenile justice system

Wooden urged the audience to
get involved in the cause of
child advocacy. Noting that “the
press does more to protect
children than legislation does,”
he named three ways in which a
citizen could report a case of in-
stitutional child abuse: Mail an
anonymous tip to a reporter or
editor; provide background infor-
mation on the story, working
with the reporter but retaining
your anonymity; “go public’—
come out with your information
in the form of a letter or article,
and lobby for legislative reform.

Wooden is currently working
on a book which will cover the
sexual abuse of children.

Kunstler lashes out at FBI,
‘flagrant injustices’

denounces

By JAN BALAKIAN

Nationally renowned attorney
William Kunstler launched a
three day symposium entitled
“Justice in America’”’ in a lecture
here Monday night.

His speech, delayed one hour
due to his involvement in a
murder case in New York City,
prompted 25 percent of the au-
dience to leave, according to an
official of the Bucknell Student
Lectureship, sponsors of the pro-
gram.

Kunstler spoke of ‘‘flagrant in-
justices imposed on outlaws,”
those whom he defined as ‘‘lack-
ing rights because they are out-
side the law.”

“Blacks and people from third
world countries have always
been outlaws,” Kunstler said. He
expounded on the plight of
blacks, which he said he is
“heavily familiar with.” Citing
examples of ‘perversions of
law,”’ he pointed to the recent
case of McDuffie, a black in-
surance salesman who was at-
tacked in Miami by white
policemen. The officers were
subsequently acquitted.

Kunstler said that ‘‘there is no
need for an FBI.” He outlined a
pending bill in Congress, the FBI
Charter Act of 1979. This bill
would legitimize murder as a law
enforcement mechanism, Kunst-
ler said, adding that it would
authorize the FBI to probe into
anyone’s personal affairs.

He also spoke of the FBI’s
lethal action regarding blacks,
citing the case of Jeanne Seberg,
who accompanied Jane Fonda to
a Black Panther fund raising
meeting in Los Angeles.

“She was killed by the FBI as

a
Attorney William Kunstler speaks Monday night in the Davis
Gymnasium. He was the keynote speaker of the Bucknell

Student

sure as if they put the gun to her
head and pulled the trigger,”
Kunstler said. He compared the
alleged FBI fabrication of a
newspaper article to the fabrica-
tions that victimized Christ. The
article stated that Seberg had
been impregnated by a Black
Panther. Seberg was so upset by
the FBI’s actions that she killed
herself,”’ Kunstler said.

Kunstler also spoke of former
FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover’s
“heinous conduct.” He said that
Hoover, on one occasion, had
termed Martin Luther King ‘“‘the
biggest liar in America and the
most dangerous Negro.” Kunst-
ler said that Hoover held the
dangerous assumption that the
end justifies the means.

Lectureship’'s symposium:

“Justice in America.”

Although Kunstler did not give
any specific solutions, he told the
audience to “‘protest injustice, to
become less diverted, to escape
the quietude of which we all have
become victims.” He reminisced
about the decade of the 60’s. ‘‘The
sixties were alive, vibrant,
altruistic,’’ Kunstler said.
“College troops stopped the Viet-
nam War.”

Kunstler said he sees a very
rough decade ahead, with a great
deal of oppression on the local
level. As pessimistic as he
seemed to be about the lack of
justice in America, he said he
holds the conviction that most
people are struggling to be de-
cent.

Ken Wooden speaks Thursday night as part of the ‘Justice in
America’ symposium sponsored by the Bucknell Student
Lectureship. Wooden spoke on children’s rights in the U.S.
legal system, and urged the audience to get involved in the
cause of children’s advocacy. The lecture was sparsely at-
tended and was held in the Vaughan Literature Auditorium.

Hostilities increase
between Iran-Iraq

Fighting between Iraq and Iran
has intensified since early
September when Iraq seized 90
square miles of Iranian territory.

Hostilities, derived in part
from Iran’s attempt to impose its
culture on Iraqis have
culminated in the cessation of all
oil exports from the Persian Gulf
by beth countries.

Iraq has attacked Iran’s huge
oil refinery at Abadan, and Iran
has bombed the Iraqi capital of
Baghdad and three oil installa-
tions.

Both sides report renewed air
raids on oil centers, and the Ira-
qis say they have bombed Iranian
oil storage tanks on Kharg
Island, an oil loading terminal.

President Carter said the
United States and all other coun-
tries should maintain neutrality
and said he supported interna-
tional efforts to end the fighting.

Interruption of oil shipments
from Iraq and Iran will not
hinder American economic
security, Carter said.

Carter’s primary concern is to
keep the Strait of Hormuz open
as sixty percent of the oil in the

OF
LIFE AND DEATH

world’s international trade
passes through this strait.

If escalating hostilities en-
danger oil exports from other
Persian Gulf countries, like Saudi
Arabia, it is expected that Carter
will seek international interven-
tion.

9 megaton warhead
to be inspected

A nine-megaton nuclear
warhead was sent to Pantex
Nuclear Weapons Assembly
Plant near Amarillo, Texas, for
analysis. It was accidentally
ejected from a Titan 2 missile
Friday.

According to a defense depart-
ment official, there was no radia-
tion leakage as a result of the ex-
plosion.

One airman was killed in the
accident and 21 others were in-
jured. At least 1,400 area
residents were forced to evacuate
their homes.

Technicians opened the
warhead and poured an oil mix-
ture into it before moving it, in an
effort to neutral its detonator.

The Air Force Mishap In-
vestigation Board, which
authorized the missile site, may
take up to two months to deter-
mine why a fuel leak led to the
sudden explosion.

Senate investigation

won’t press Carter

Senate investigators of Billy
Carter’s ties with Libya will sub-
mit written questions concerning
President Carter’s involvement
in the matter to the White House
staff.

Carter will not be called to
testify in person before the
senators.

Carter previously said he
would answer all the senators’
questions. He said he would
testify in public under oath if the
subcommittee, headed by In-

CPI, inflation rise
during August ’80

The Bureau of Labor Statistics
reported the Consumer Price In-
dex for the month of August in-
creased by seven-tenths of one
percent and the larger increases
are likely in September.

If this rate continued for a
year, it would produce an an-
nual inflation rate of 8.6 percent.

The rise of inflation was
substantial but only half as
much as the rises of 1.4 percent
in each of the first three months
of 1980.

Higher prices for fresh food,
and for new and used cars and
houses drove the index up in
August.

Officials of the Bureau of

4Labor Statistics and Agriculture

forecast sustained food price in-
creases in upcoming months.

At a Joint Economic Commit-
tee hearing, William Proxmire
said the United States economy
had never before come out of a
recession with such a high rate
of inflation.

WILLIAM A. TORREY

Torrey named head

of Annual Giving

William A. Torrey, the former
assistant director of Annual Giv-
ing here, has been promoted to
the directorship of that depart-
ment, Vice President for Univer-
sity Relations John Ferguson has
announced.

Torrey — who earned both a
bachelor’s and a master’s degree
from the University — will con-
tinue as the University’s liaison
to the Bucknell Parents Associa-
tion.

In 1978 and 1979 he served as an

- area director for the campaign to

construct the Sports/Recreation
Center and as assistant to the
vice president for University
Relations and the director of An-
nual Giving.

He has also served in the past
two years as assistant and
associate director for Annual
Giving. He replaces Sara Man-
ner, who became director of
development in May.

Bookstore stops

Rely tampon sales

Rely tampons, a product of the
Procter & Gamble Co., were
removed from the shelves of the
University Bookstore Tuesday
following a voluntary recall by
the manufacturer Monday, ac-
cording to David Reich, assistant
manager for operations at the
store.

Although no official word was
received from the manufacturer,
Reich said, a decision was made
Tuesday based on certain “media
reports’’ to discontinue the sale of
this product. These media
reports, one of which appeared on

arerereoeseueeverers

the front page of Tuesday’s New
York Times, presented the fin-
dings of government studies con-
cluding that the use of Rely tam-
pons increases the risk of
developing toxic shock syn-
drome. This disorder is a serious
affliction that can prove fatal.

Approximately 50 million
American women use tampons
and, according to a spokesman
for the National Center for
Disease Control, any of these
women has the potential to
develop TSS (toxic shock syn-
drome). For some reason,
however, Rely seems to heighten
that chance. As yet unconfirmed
theories state that Rely’s ab-
sorbancy agent, carbox-
ymethylcellulose, might in fact
be a breeding ground for TSS
bacterium.

Any woman who has purchased
this product from the bookstore
will be permitted to return it for a
refund. Rely was distributed with
the Good Stuffs box received by
Bucknell women at the beginning
of the year.

Frosh election results close;
2 students tie in one contest

By ALLISON ABOUCHAR
and DAVID HAWKINGS

In the only disputed contest
among the 16 elections for ABS
Congressional - representatives
Tuesday, Steve Garfinkel and
Noreen Walsh tied in the race for
Class of ’84 secretary/treasurer
with 107 votes each.

The 45 percent of the class that
went to the polls — less than the
percentage of freshman voting
last year — also elected Dan
Huck as president and Scooter
Hoerrner vice president with 153
and 158 votes, respectively.

Huck defeated Michael Con-
cordia by 24 votes, while Hoerr-
ner had nearly double the votes
tallied by Nick Badami.

According to ABS President
John Dzurinko ’81, 32 ballots from
freshmen men were nearly
declared invalid when Dzurinko
discovered these ballots contain-
ed votes for dorm represen-
tatives from both Trax and Kress
Halls.

Election rules state that

University students may only
vote for representatives in the
building in which they live.

Vice President for Administra-
tion and Finance’ John Zeller —
who also serves as the Universi-
ty’s general counsel — ruled
Wednesday that only the dor-
mitory representative portions of
the ballot should be disqualified.

Zeller was asked to rule on the
dispute by Dzurinko.

Had he ruled that the entire
ballot was in error, 19 votes per-
taining to the secre-
tary/treasurer contest would
have been eliminated, and Gar-
finkel would have edged Walsh
for the position by one vote, 98 to
Cris

After the vice president’s rul-
ing, Dzurinko counted the ballots
three more times. Twice his
count produced a tie, and so the
draw was declared.

ABS Vice President Pete Fran-
cino ’81 — who is charged in the
by-laws of the ABS with running
the body’s elections — did not

participate in the final count.

In order to resolve the tie,
Dzurinko asked that the two can-
didates decide for themselves
how to split the responsibilities of
the office. Garfinkel and Walsh
decided Wednesday to serve
respectively as treasurer and
secretary of the class.

Walsh said she was “happy
with the results.”

Gunnar Armstrong and Marty
Pflegger were elected to repre-
sent Trax Hall, David Grossman
and John Held beat three other
candidates to represent Kress
Hall, Tricia Kennedy and Sue
Stanley won the Roberts Hall
post and Trevy O’Leary won an
uncontested election in Harris
Hall in the contests for freshman
dormitory representatives to the
ABS Congress.

Twenty-one percent of all up-
perclassmen voted in the elec-
tions for upperclass dormitory
representatives. Laurie Holben
83. and Lisa Hoff ’81 were
elected as representatives from

Freshmen class president, Dan Huck, and Scooter Hoerrner,

vice president.

Hunt Hall and Bill Walz ’82 and
Charlotte Baybutt ’81 will repre-
sent Bucknell West. Mark
Tutungdy ’81, defeated one other
candidate in the contest for Off-
Campus Housing representative.
In unchallenged contests,
Vergel Blake ’82 won for Special
Interest Housing, Margot Van-
Buskirk ’82 for Vedder Hall, Chip
Douglas ’81 for the Inter-
Fraternity Council, Beth Battin

‘New Morality of Life and Death’ subject of ’80 fall colloquy

By TOM ELKAS

“The New Morality of Life and
Death” is the theme of this fall’s
colloquy, which begins Thursday
and concludes Oct. 3.

The fall colloquy will explore
ethical questions raised by ad-
vances in biomedics and is spon-
sored by Concern and Action.

David Ludwick ’81, is chairper-
son of the colloquy. According to
Ludwick, the colloquy was
designed ‘“‘to allow for com-
munication between
Bucknellians and guest
speakers.”

“What makes the colloquy such
a unique experience is the in-
teraction of the guests and
students during the three day
symposium. The opportunity for
contact with the speakers is
enhanced by the fact that the
guests stay on campus and eat
meals in the U.C.,”’ Ludwick said.

films. Promises in the Dark is a
feature length film starring Mar-
sha Mason. It will be shown Fri-
day at 10 p.m. in the Vaughan

sion is free.

The film deals with the way a
doctor must handle the questions

of the rights of a dying patient.
Both sides of the “right to die”
issue are raised providing the au-
dience a chance to make its own
decision.

Two short films also to be

The fourth film in this series is

are presented in the mock trial.
The verdict is once again left for

Keeping the gate open

Fraternity rush has begun and once again each freshman man will have to make
a decision on membership in one of these organizations. In recent years the percen-
tage of men pledging has risen dramatically, as has the volume of cries from
students bemoaning the lack of non-fraternity social life. Yes, there is a coffeehouse
on the weekend and a film on Wednesday and Friday, but the only regular social
contact comes through the Greek system.

This situation came to the attention of Concern and Action, the underlying pur-
pose of which is to improve the tenor of student life. CA responded last week with
an addition to its volunteer programs called Christy’s Gate.

Billed in advance publicity as a place to relax and as a retreshing change otf
pace, Christy's Gate proved so successful on its first run that it is scheduled to
reappear two times more this semester. These engagements will be the final test of
the ultimate popularity of the program because Christy’s Gate will be facing its stif-
fest competition/-fraternity rush parties.

What is required is not a once-a-week event, but something of a more permanent
nature.

Thus, the University has been handed the answer of what to do with part of
the third floor of the University Center. By permitting Christy’s Gate to take up
permanent residence there, the administration would not only be filling the space
with what could become a revenue producing venture, but will also be giving
students the opportunity to enjoy an alternative to the present social offerings.

The weekend is here...

It’s Friday, and we're anxiously awaiting another successful Greek Weekend. As
we've said before, we welcome the weekend as a salutory change to an all too of-
ten secular and mundane social life.

We agree with Steve Kohn ’81, IFC president, that ber is not the focal point of
the event. The plethora of contests and ganes as well as the point philanthropy in-
volved proves these festivities to be both well planned and intentioned—far to ex-
tensive to be corralled inside such anarrow scope.

While we agree with Kohn that beer is not the “focal point” of Greek weekend,
the brew has nonetheless been a central issue of controversy. The fact that the

University has not established a lucid policy on times and places of alcohol con-
sumption is disconcerting.

Moreover, we’re sure that those involved with Greek Weekend would agree that

the consumption of alcohol on University property during the festivities should be
“officially sanctioned”.

For a safe Route 15

The serious accident at Route 15 and Moore Avenue on Tuesday night raises
questions about the adequacy of the traffic control system at the intersection.

This was not an isolated incident. There have been several accidents at the inter-
section in the past involving Bucknell students.

Hundreds of Bucknellians, primarily
tramural athletes cross Route 15 every
are a stoplight and a painted crosswalk.

Bucknell West residents and varsity and in-
day and night, yet the only safety devices

During daylight hours, this seems to be an effective system. However, after dark,
as the accident records prove, these devices are not enough.

We believe there are two alternatives that should seriously be considered.

The safest alternative is a well-lit, well-designed pedestrian tunnel. This would
eliminate the possibility of students being hit by motor vehicles. The pedestrian
tunnel for school children under Routes 11 and 15 in Shamokin Dam demonstrates
that this is a feasible alternative.

The second possibility is to improve the lighting in the vicinity of the intersec-
tion, Standard highway lights lining Route 15 for one quarter mile in both direc-
tions would improve visibility and alert motorists of the upcoming stoplight. Also,
additional flashing warning lights, like the one near Stadium Drive should be in-
stalled.

The administration should immediately investigate these proposals.

, ¢ Y As long as the
intersection remains unsafe, additional serious accidents are imminent.

CCM and Swartz Dorm Council: Mass controversy

To the Editor:

I should like to offer some per-
sonal comment on an issue of con-
siderable importance to the
Bucknell community, keeping the
following caveat in mind:

“Men who fight about
religion have no religion to
fight about since they do in
the name of religion the
thing which religion itself
forbids. Joseph Fort Newton

On Thursday, the Catholic
Campus Ministry proposed to the
Swartz Dorm Council the follow-
ing: that an open Roman Catholic
Mass be held in one of the Swartz
lounges on a given Thursday
evening in the hope that residents
of all creeds might feel free to
celebrate, to investigate, and to
share in a ritual of mutual
acknowledgement of God.

It was further proposed that
CCM and the SDS co-sponsor an

open study break for all Swartz
dorm residents following the
Mass. It was hoped that such a
study break would serve both as
an overtly hedonistic social event
(gasp!) and as an open forum for
the exchange of ideas. In this
manner CCM sought to foster an
environment which possessed
both redeeming educational and
social qualities that would per-
tain directly to the interests of
Bucknell students.

In considering this proposal it
should be noted that CCM intend-
ed neither to proselytize, pon-
tificate, nor unilaterally pro-
pound.

The propogation of the faith is
for surer souls.

Regrettably, the SDC rejected
this proposal, stating that it
would only consider co-
sponsorship of an event which
was not initiated by any single
religious group.

Apparently this decision was
predicated upon the belief that
the sponsorship of one special in-
terest group would, by implica-
tion, obligate the dorm council to
co-sponsor events with other such
groups. Perhaps a separation of
religion and governance seemed
appropriate here in order to pre-
vent inequitable or differential
treatment of groups because of
their respective ideologies.

I have no doubt that the
members of the SDC invoked
these principles in order to pre-
vent setting a dangerous prece-
dent which they thought could
possibly lead to any number of
undesirable consequences. Yet is
is sadly ironic that in so attemp-
ting to save Bucknell from
religious intolerance, they have
unknowingly become caught in a
‘Kantian dilemma.’

The SDC has adhered to a set of

Beer is not the focal point

testivities disappoints me.

Beer is a nice extra as are the
food and birch beer which will be
served. I would hate to think that
without the beer the weekend
would not be a success.

To the Editor:

In last week’s Bucknellian,
there appeared two articles
regarding the University alcohol
policy and its effect on this 1980
Greek Weekend. I respect and
understand the Bucknellian’s in-
terest in the new, controversial
‘interpretation of the University’s
alcohol policy and I also ap-

preciate the Bucknellian’s con- .

cern for the success of Greek
Weekend.

However, beer is not the focal
point of Greek Weekend. Greek

Weekend is an event sponsored
by the Interfraternity and
Panhellenic Councils to bring in-
dividuals and groups from the
campus and surrounding com-
munity together to compete in
games, take part in a carnival
benefitting a philanthropy, swim
for cancer, run for prizes and to
basically have a good time.

The fact that last week’s
editorial article assumed that the
alcohol policy would “‘confine and
limit in size” the carnival at-
mosphere of the Greek Weekend

In the future, I ask that the
Bucknellian, and anyone for that
matter, take notice of the positive
services of Greek Weekend and
not just the alcohol aspect often
associated with all Greek events.

Student cries for more coverage

To the Editor:

A disservice was done last week in the
Bucknellian’s reporting of the debut of Christy’s
Gate. While a uniquely innovative special event was
being unveiled to the Bucknell campus, the
Bucknellian chose to concentrate on the increasing-
ly mundane topics of beer and Greek life, along with
the dramatic (or melodramatic) reorganization of
campus security.

Surely these stories cannot possibly match the
excitement of a student organization volunteering
inordinate amounts of time, energy, money and car-
ing to bring Bucknell a new and refreshing alter-
native to fraternities and the Bison.

The impact of Christy’s Gate cannot alone be
measured by the 700-plus students, faculty and ad-
ministrators who enjoyed excellent food, a relaxed
atmosphere, entertainment and friendly service.
Instead, the meaning of the event must be concen-
trated on in order to understand its significance.

Representing a profound deviation from both

Greek abandon and Coffee house theatrics, C.A.’s. __.__-__-_____--___---___----B

Christy’s Gate has opened new doors of social enjoy-
ment that stress relaxed conversation in a pub at-
mosphere.

Even allowing for the demanding deadlines of a
publication like the Bucknellian, surely the editors
can recognize the significance of such an event and
do the campus a service by appropriate coverage.
With this in mind, an apology is due to those scores
of students who helped with Christy’s Gate. It is this
kind of activity, concentrating on bringing people
together for stimulating conversation, relaxation
and good music in an intimate atmosphere that will
lift Bucknell out of its decadent, self-destructive
social structure.

Hopefully, Christy’s Gate and new ideas like it
will not be one-time events but will continue to
breathe new life into the Bucknell experience. In
order for this to happen, student, faculty, and ad-
ministrative support will have to be developed in
concert to an extent not demonstrated in last week’s
Bucknellian. I hope we are up to the task.

standard precepts, thereby
preserving an ideal, but when
these precepts prevent the
realization of the ideals they so
actively seek to protect,
something must be said.

The CCM proposed their
Mass/study break, I think, for
four main reasons: to recognize
that no single faith possesses a
monopoly on religious truth; to
bring a sense of God back into our
homes, the historical centers of
worship in all Judeo-Christian
religions; to foster a sense of
good will and table fellowship
among all people; and to actively
attack the spectre of religious in-
tolerance and discrimination
through an informal, voluntary
program of interfaith interaction.

Given that the reasons
enumerated above are, in fact,
consistent with CCM’s intents
and purposes, it should be ap-

parent that the SDC is correct but
only in a prima facie way. They
have unknowingly upheld a stan-
dard to the exclusion of a similar
equally valid standard.

In this difficult case one cannot
follow a set of abstract prin-
ciples, regardless of their ap-
parent expediency, to the exclu-
sion of the potential conse-

-quences they entail without an-
ticipating contradictory results.

It seems to me that both groups
had the same ends in mind. It is
tragic that a mutual
misunderstanding has occurred.

Rather than promote a
dynamic interchange of ideas
between students of varying
faiths, the SDC has opted for a
situation which can only enforce
the unacceptable status quo of
religious myopia in the Bucknell
community.

you re right

I cannot let Richard Pisano’s article condemning the
economics and political science departments of “collectivism’”’ and
of using academic freedom ‘“‘to strike at the social and economic
foundations of our society without opposition” go unanswered.
Pisano is certainly entitled to like the thought of Frederich Hayek if
he wants to, but he is not entitled to say that unless there are faculty
here who subscribe to that position the departments are hiring pad-

ly,

the administration is failing the students, and where it counts,

students are being presented with only one point of view.

Of course anyone can claim that unless their particular view-
point has a spokesman on the faculty, they are being denied a
balanced education. Anyone can make such a claim, but that fact
alone reveals its vacuousness, which keeps most people, Pisano ex-

cepted, from doing so.
If Pisano is serious,

let him try to convince us that Hayek is

right. That would be respectable. What he wrote is not.

On Monday, fraternity rush began once
again. The familiar sight of freshmen hall
groups parading down fraternity row,
briefly entering each house along the way
and sometimes stumbling home a few
hours later has become a campus rite of
fall. Although it sometimes seems as if
fraternities exist only to improve the
social life of their members, the reasons
and purposes behind rush are many.

“Everyone has different reasons for
joining a fraternity, whether it be for beer,
friendship or just a better place to live,”
said Steve Kohn ’81, Interfraternity Coun-
cil president and a member of Sigma Phi
Epsilon fraternity.

This year, over 75% of first year men
paid a $2.00 registration fee and prepared
for the trek down fraternity row. Kohn said
many more were expected to register late
for rush. By the time rush is over in
November, Kohn estimated that over 95%
of the freshmen class will attend at least
one rush party.

Kohn and several other IFC members
compiled an outline stating the main ad-
vantages of rush from a fraternity’s point
of view. Prominent among them were the
development of leadership potential, op-
portunity for community service and, of
course, increased social life.

Among the better known philanthrophic
activities of campus fraternities are Delta
Upsilon’s Demie play, Sigma Chi’s Sig
Derby, and Phi Psi 500, sponsored by Phi
Kappa Psi. Fraternities engage in many
lesser known charity events as well. The
IFC believes these activities, as well as
numerous posts of responsibility within the
fraternities themselves, combine to give
members important leadership and
management skills.

Significantly, brotherhood remains the
primary purpose of the fraternity. They
seek not only to provide companionship
during the college years, but lifelong
friendships as well.

Rush is divided into two segments, for-
mal and informal. Formal rush, which
took place for four days this week, provid-
ed an opportunity for freshmen to get a
first glimpse of fraternity life and the in-
side of the Greek houses. Informal rush,
spread over seven weeks, is when brothers
and rushees become acquainted with each
other in earnest.

Formal rush retains the glossy at-
mosphere of fraternity girlfriends and lit-
tle sisters registering and pinning name
tags on freshmen, while some fraternal
brothers are dressed in suits and ties, all to
make the best impression.

“Fraternities feel they have to put on
airs during formal rush,” said Bruce
Bowen ’82, rush chairman of Lambda Chi
Alpha. ‘Informal rush is much more
natural.”

“During formal rush everyone seems to
put on an image,” freshman Rob Pohls
likewise observed.

Most fraternity members agreed with
this, and several mentioned the Monday
night football parties as especially useful
in getting to know rushees better. ‘‘Those
that show up on Monday night are usually
fairly interested in the house. We’re all in
one room, watching the game, and it’s a
good atmosphere,” said Paul Rasmussen,
co-rush chairman of DU.

Kohn echoed these sentiments, saying
that the seven weeks provided ‘‘plenty of
ed for a relaxed rush. The pressure is
off.””

The goals of each fraternity are as
diverse as the organizations themselves.
Different fraternities stress different
elements of the Greek scene. Some are
hoping to expand this year, some to re-
main stable in size.

“Often fraternities are intentionally
kept small because the brothers like a
closeknit house. Too often people assume
that smallness means a fraternity is un-

Friday, September 26, 1980

popular,” Kohn said.

““We’ll be working more for the brothers
during rush than worrying about attrac-
ting lots of people. If the brothers are hav-
ing a good time at a party, everyone else
probably is too,” said Joe Ruskiewicz 82,
president of Phi Lambda Theta.

“We’re not overly concerned with
numbers. We want people that will be an
asset to the house,”’ Bowen said of Lambda
Chi, which last spring lost more than one
third of its membership due to reorganiza-
tion by a national LCA review board. Ac-
cording to Bowen, LCA is “smaller and
strong Our strength comes from within
the brotherhood, and we’ll be seeking out
people that can aid it.”

Similarly, other fraternities are looking
for new members that will effectively run
the house’s activities. ‘‘We hope to attract
people that are interested in supplemen-
ting their academic life with fraternity liv-
ing. In other words, having a good time is
important, but so is responsibility,” said
Tom Jackson ’82, rush chairman of Theta
Chi. His thoughts were shared by many

other rush chairmen, including co-
chairman Doug Conners of DU.

“We're looking for anywhere between 20
and 30 people that can contribute to the
house and get something out of it. In selec-
ting members, we look for freshmen that
would be the future leaders of the house
and are able to sustain its reputation,”
Conners said.

“Our main goal is to get SAM back on its
feet,”’ said Chris Hartnett, ’83 rush chair-
man of Sigma Alpha Mu. Last week, Hart-
nett and five other members of the class of
’83 pledged SAM, raising its total member-
ship to eleven. ‘‘We saw the rooms last
year and wanted to live downhill, but we’re
also very interested in building up the
fraternity,’ Hartnett continued.

In the future, the brothers of SAM hope
to be able to fill their house entirely with
members of the fraternity. Presently, the
house is owned by the university and con-
tains a number of independents.

Few changes are being instituted in rush
this year. Several fraternities expressed
the desire to hold more events outside of

Goals of fraternity life are exami

the house, such as football and basketball
games between brothers and rushees. In
general fraternities were pleased with last
year’s results — with a few exceptions.

“A trend away from alcohol would be
great. If its importance could be minimiz-
ed, better communication between
rushees and brothers would result,” said
Ken Wolckenhauer ’82 of Sigma Alpha Ep-
silon.

Whatever the advantages of fraternity
rush, there are disadvantages too. ‘In
general, by having rush first semester,
fraternities fracture the male freshman
class. Rushees immediately take on the
personality of the fraternity they’re in-
terested in,”’ said Bill Thum ’82, a member
of the university’s Complimentary Ac-

elected last year through the ABS, in-

By TODDG. BUCHHOLZ

Squeezed between a week of
justice in America and a weekend
of Bacchus and Budweiser, I'd
like to make some connections
between the two.

The University has chosen this
year as the year of the teetotaler
and is honoring this rare breed of
bison by enforcing rules on drink-
ing in the dorms.

Someone apparently dug up the
time capsule of 1920 and read the
University policy stating “The
consumption of alcoholic

beverages is prohibited in the
main public rooms and similar
common areas of the residence
halls. . .””

Bury it again. It is incredible,
unrealistic, counterproductive
and unjust.

Presumably, the purpose of the
code is to prevent drunken
Bucknellians from tripping over
chairs and punching out win-
dows. The University takes a
great insurance risk every time
someone reaches for some gusto.

Admittedly this is a problem.

How do we solve it?

First, what not to do. Do not
ban kegs from halls, yet allow
them in dorm rooms. You don’t
need a mechanical engineering
degree to lift a keg, move it from
the hall into a room and then
dispense beer. Are 50 students in
a cubicle preferable and less
hazardous than 50 students in a
hall? It sounds like good training
for a telephone-booth-stuffing
team.

Second, don’t invoke policies
that will force people into the
frats if they want a drink.

One day the administration
seeks alternatives to Greek par-
ties and the next day they em-
phasize an important feature ofa

I have been informed by an ad-
ministration official that no
students are attracted here
because of fraternities, yet many
are discouraged by their
predominance. Keep that in mind
as high school enrollment
declines.

Obviously the new measures
are counterproductive.

What to do? Responsibility and
accountability are the answer.
The University must hold
students accountable for their ac-
tions, whether committed when
sober or drunk.

If the regime in Marts Hall
wants us to learn to drink and
handie ourselves as adults, they
should treat us and punish us as

Bison Chips album

rated nearly pertect

By STU GAY

“Here Today ... Gone Tomorrow,” the first Bison Chips album
ever, is by no means perfect, though it certainly provides 35 minutes of
enjoyable music.

Then again, even the
of the late 1950s —

This first offering
includes 18 cuts, ranging

cludes the alma mater, “Go Bisons” and “Hail

The voices of the Chips: Bob Moylan ’80, lead te
82, first tenor; Richard Pisano ’82, baritone, and
bass, comprise a particularly well-blended ensemble for the close har-
mony. They also can handle solos more than adequately.

What really makes the disc as much fun as it is, though, is both the
variety and length of the songs. Amateur groups tend to indulge
themselves and “pad” their work by recording long — and often bor-
ing — songs.

The Bison Chips can not be accused of this. They have an excellent
sense of what constitutes “enough” and they give the listener so many
variations in their selection of songs that the boredom perhaps ex-
pected ina recording of this type never sets in. The longest cut on the
album is a mere two minutes, 50 seconds.

“The Chordbuster March” sets the album off on the proper foot and
in the proper vein, for it is a classic barbershop song like “Coney
Island Baby” on the flip side. Also performed is what must be the
shortest recorded version ever of “In the Mood” at only one minute, 50
seconds.

Of the ten songs performed on a more serious note, “Sentimental
Journey” and the afformentioned “Graduation Day” strike par-
ticularly pleasing chords. :

The hit of the album is “Bye Bye Blues,” however. The cut starts off
in a mild enough manner, but when the ‘‘Bison Chipmunks” break in
at the end it’s worth another listen.

If the Chips ever release a single, this should be it.

In all aspects, this first Bucknell barbershop album is easy;
to listen to, easy-to have fun with and easy to enjoy.

Consistent with the praise of
outsiders for the Hilltop series,
this season opened with favorable
audience response assuring the
survival of the program, which
was at one time in question.

The Friday evening showings
began Sept. 5 when the popular
Italian film Amarcord
directed by Frederico Fellini was
presented. It was followed by two
more Italian movies and
tonight’s work, “That Obscure
Object of Desire, is the first of
two Spanish tilms. French,
British, Swedish, Russian and
Japanese films will all be aired.

The Hilltop committee, con-

students, selec

pasis of ‘aesthetic and historic
values,” according to Patten.
Beginning in March of the
previous year, the committee
traditionally goes through a pro-
_ cess of discussion and review that
narrows a list of between 80 and

period of up

100 films down to about 25. The
review usually lasts about one
month and is open to anyone in-
terested in working on the pro-
posed slate.

The committee’s next step is
the highly competitive process of
contracting the best films from
New York-based distributors at
lowest possible costs. Most ex-
pensive are the newest films,
some of which have a waiting
to three years be-

‘The Bucknell film
program is well
known and admired
among New York film
distributors. They cite
ours as one of the best
college film programs
in the mid-Atlantic re-
gion.’

tween the time of release in the
U.S. and that of availability to
colleges.

Over the years, however,
Bucknell’s Hilltop program has
had a close association with
distributors and has attained a
good reputation. This has made it
possible for the committee to con-
tract most of this year’s films at
significant reductions from the
going prices.

Brubaker profound and
moving, but not realistic
with portrayal of reform

Thomas Murton, former pro-
fessor of criminal sciences and
penology, always agreed with the
eminent English political philoso-
pher Edmund Burke that “the
only thing essential for the
triumph of evil is for good men
to do nothing and remain
silent.” When he became a pri-
son superintendent, he heard of
and personally saw so many in-
justices committed that he had
to do something.

The experiences he went
through serve loosely as a basis
for [Brubaker], which follows the
attempts of an idealistic warden
to reform the prison system.

The movie opens on a group
of convicts being transported to
the Wakefield State Penitentiary.
With them is Robert Redford,
clearly not just another prisoner.

During the seemingly endless
drive to the prison and the first
few days of his residence there,
he is a silent presence registering
signs of corruption and respon-
ding to the numberous acts of
unwarranted cruelty with an
anguished, out-of-place com-
passion.

The need for a tough but
compassionate warden to clean
up the running of Wakefield has
been clearly demonstrated by the
time Brubaker appears on the
scene. It is shown in_ his
segments to be a courageous
man so determined to right the
wrongs of the place that he is
willing to enter the medieval tor-
ture chamber the prison is
likened to as one of the power-
less and manipulated prisoners.

Within a short time, Redford
identifies himself as Henry
Brubaker, Wakefield’s mew war-
den. In the scene before this
revelation the audience receives
a glimpse of the prison from the
inside.
by gun-carrying guards (prisoners

trusted by the officials) who, in |

connivance with the profit-seek-

ing prison administration and |

board, supply prisoners to local
farms and businesses as slave
laborers, while stealing and

The men are controlled j

hoarding the penitentiary’s food
for their personal use.

The climax of the movie both
dramtically and emotionally oc-
curs as Brubaker, not yet
divested of his convict’s dis-
guise, intervenes when a black
prisoner breaks out of his death-
row “hole’—so called because
the men imprisoned there are
allowed into the sun only a few
minutes each year—and aitempts
to strangle a younger man.

The intensity of the situation
captivates the audience, some-
thing that recurs throughout the
entire movie and speaks well for
the direction of Stuart Rosen-
burg.

Although moving and deeply
affecting, the way the film  it-
self is presented is sometimes
unrealistic. The changes Brubaker
affects are necessary and
plausible ones, but their after-
math is implausable. For in-
stance, he rails against the un-
cleanliness of the dining facili-
ties, and within minutes the kit-
chen is spotless and the prison-
ers are all smiling at each other.

It is to be admitted that in a
life filled with unending filth
and degradation, convincingly
shown in the opening scenes of
the movie, any minor improve-
ment will bring elation, but this
was overplayed in an unneces-
sary effort to win the audience
to Brubaker’s cause.

The movie does have many
social implications as well. [Bru-
baker] flirts with the idea that

Robert Redford, who plays Henry Brubaker in 20th Century Fox's new release, discusses his
role with Thomas Murton. Murton’s real-life experiences provide the background material
for the story of a warden attempting to effect changes in the corrupt prison operations he
comes up against. The movie will be shown at the Campus Theater on Market Street, with
screenings at 7 and 9 p.m. every night.

the prison, and perhaps all
aspects of our society, will not
improve because the community
in which it rests is inherently
corrupt.

It alludes to the notion that
evil is so encompassing even the
mythical American hero is
powerless to change it; though
he does succeed in providing the
prisoners with a tiny last glim-
mer of hope Brubaker fails in
his efforts at prison reform. A
stirring and deeply moving film,
(Brubaker] leaves the audience
with many profound questions
to contemplate.

The film opens tonight at the
Campus Theater on Market
Street.

Tennis is young & optimistic

By JEANNE MINAHAN

and JEFF CROSS

The women’s tennis team en-
ters its seven match fall season
with a young squad that is
“anxious and optimistic,” accord-
ing to coach Rose Ewan.

The inexperienced Bisons have
only two seniors and one junior
on the squad that finished 2-4
last spring and 2-3 in last year’s
fall season. Ewan states, “We
hope to be guaranteed three of
six singles matches, so the three
doubles matches will be
decisive.”

However, Donna and Diana
Burns, last season’s first and
third singles players, respectively,
have graduated. Jumping up to

the first singles position is sopho- five of six matches in the spring

more Patty Koch. Koch, who
Ewan cited as “the most con-
sistent player on the team last
year,” had a 9-1 record in the
third spot.

Sarah Kreiger °83, a transfer
student from Drew University,
replaces senior co-captain Kirsten
Schubauer in the second slot.
Schubauer, who Ewan said,
“possesses nice deep strokes and
a good cross court shot,” drops

to third. ‘
In the fourth spot will be

sophomore Cindy Appel, who
gained experience and confidence
in summer tournaments. Senior
co-captain Janice Huber remains
in the fifth position. Huber won

and Ewan is “counting on that
point in almost every match.”

Laura Kirchstein, the only
freshman to break into the star-
ting lineup, will play in the final
singles spot. Ewan commented,
“Kirchstein is a slow starter but
she almost always comes on.”

The three doubles tandems
have yet to be determined, but
will be comprised of the top six
singles players, according to
Ewan. The remaining women
who will see action are junior
Kathy Riker, sophomore Jan
Balakian and freshmen Julie
Fischer, Susan St. Clair, Lisa
Smails and Ann Wilbur.

The Bisons open in Washing-
ton D.C. against Catholic Uni-
versity on Sunday. The match is
the. first ever between the
squads. Ewan is optimistic,
stating, “There is a positive atti-
tude on the team.” Huber con-
fidently adds, “I believe we're a
strong team with a lot of depth.”

Herd topples Slippery Ro

By STEVEN SKOLNICK and
MICHAEL SUAREZ

The playbook calls it the 421”
—a sweep to the right side. Last
Saturday against Slippery Rock
the “121” worked beautifully all
afternoon. With 4:21 remaining in
the second quarter, the Bison of-
fense executed this simple play
perfectly.

Quarterback Al Locey 83 took
the snap, faked left to his fullback
and handed off to Ken Jenkins
82. The junior workhorse fol-
lowed pulling weakside guard
Darren Ford ’81 closely, and as
the tandem found the seam
created by the offensive line,
Jenkins cut upfield and ac-
celerated through the lane. When
he hit open ground, all of
Memorial Stadium was on its feet
while Jenkins outran the final two
defenders on a 76-yard scoring
sprint.

The touchdown put the Bisons
in front 19-0 on their way toa 25-6
thrashing of the Rock. The score
was typical of Bucknell’s play as
they scored on four of their first
five possessions. Head Coach Bob
Curtis commented, ‘“‘We utilized
a ball control offense that was

vi L*

jya®

systematically designed to keep
the defense off the field.”

Bucknell kept the ball on the
ground, amassing 259 yards
rushing from Jenkins, Geoff
Gallo ’82 and Marshall Hall ’83.

The Bisons established
themselves early as they pound-
ed their way to the Rock one-yard
line on their first possession. With
a third-and-goal situation Locey
hit paydirt when he plunged over
the line on a QB keeper. Junior
Bill Grennon’s extra point was
good and Bucknell was on top,
74.

The Herd defense shut the Rock
down on the next series when
defensive back McKinley Norris
intercepted a Chuck Sirko aerial
and returned it two yards to the
Slippery Rock 33. Four plays
later Grennon booted a 44-yard
field goal to make the score 10-0.

The Bison defense continued to
thwart Slippery Rock’s offensive
efforts through most of the se-
cond quarter, totally stopping
their ground game. Curtis stated,
“The defense played well against
the run. The front four were very
aggressive and the linebacking

corps also did a good job against

Midway through the second

their own 34-yard line. Powered
by the running of Jenkins and
Hall, the Orange and Blue
marched deep into Rock ter-
ritory. The drive stalled, but
Grennon connected on his second

Bisons meet Brown

By STEVEN SKOLNICK and
MICHAEL SUAREZ

The Bisons will take to the road Saturday as they square off against
Brown University in Providence, R.I., at 1:30p.m.

The Bruins, favored to capture the Ivy League title in many pre-
season polls, will be trying to recover from a 45-17 loss to Yale at home
last Saturday. Brown rallied from a 24-6 deficit to cut the lead to 24-17
with seven minutes remaining before Yale exploded for three late
scores.

Bison Head Coach Bob Curtis commented, “It’s hard to evaluate
Brown’s true performance” because they had six turnovers and 10
penalties, but ‘“‘they are a very good offensive team.”

Leading Brown’s multiple I modified pro set offense is last year’s
All-Ivy League quarterback, Larry Carbone. Curtis remarked, ‘“‘We’ll
have a lot of trouble coping with him.” Carbone completed 19 of 30
passes for 220 yards in the loss to Yale.

Carbone’s favorite ball carrier is senior tailback Rick Villella who
needs 319 yards to become the all-time leading Bruin rusher.

Flanker Mitch Metz and tight end Steve Jordan should keep the
Bison defensive secondary busy all afternoon.

The Herd will have to keep constant pressure on Carbone in order to
win. Offensively, the Bisons must establish a running game early
against Brown’s 5-2 defense. Linebacker John Woodring and defensive
back Jeff Gradinger are players to watch on the Bruin defense.

The Bucknell offensive line will miss the play of left tackle John
Boemer ’82 who severely injured a knee in the victory over Slippery
Rock last Saturday.

Lock Haven defeats

women’s soccer, 4-0

The women’s soccer club suf-
fered a 4-0 defeat to Lock Haven
at home last Sunday, dropping
the Bison’s record to 0-2. The
Eagles are 1-0.

Lock Haven stole an in-bounds
pass early in the encounter and
quickly converted, and later in
the half upped the count to 2-0.
Despite changes in the Bucknell
lineup, the Eagles continued to
keep the pressure on. Per-
serverance paid off with a fast
break goal followed by another
off a scramble in front of the
Bison net.

Coach Gordon Udall ’83 said,
“No one played to their poten-
tial.” He added, ‘‘We had some
good scoring opportunities but we
just couldn’t capitalize.”

The Bisons travel to Princeton
today and Rutgers Saturday for
first-time encounters with both
teams.

Women’s XC places
sixth at Penn State

The women’s cross country
team opened their season last
Saturday with an unofficial sixth
place finish at the Penn State
Lady Lion Invitational tourna-
ment. Penn State was the unof-
ficial winner of the meet. The of-
ficial tabulations are not ex-
pected for 3 weeks according to
Coach Dianne Ware.

Kathy Mills, a 1980 graduate of
Penn State running as an in-
dependent, captured the 4.4 mile

race in 25:09.

Top Bison finishers were
sophomores Jo Burrell and Julie
Crossman, who tied for 36th place
in 29:18.

Other Bison runners on the ‘‘A”’
team were Laura Gaydos ’83
(38th), Karen Flannigan 84
(47th), co-captain Jean LeCates
g2 (49th), Nancy Nelson ’84
(52nd), and co-captain Linda Ac-
cettura ’82 (54th).

Although the Bisons are unac-
customed to running more than
the standard 3.1 mile race, Ware
was pleased with the per-
formances of the Bucknell har-
riers on the hilly Penn State
course.

The Bisons will run in an invita-
tional meet at Indiana University
of Pennsylvania on Saturday. “If
the team works together and runs
in a pack,” commented Ware,
“we should be competitive.”

early in the match but “‘a lack of
total concentration” hurt the
Sharks, according to Peter
Maier ’81, and the Knights pulled
away to win.

Franz quits Cosmos,
returns to Germany

Franz Beckenbauer, world
renowned German soccer player,
played his last game in the U.S.
as a New York Cosmo Wednes-
day night. He has signed a two-
year contract to play with Ham-
burg in the Bundesliga, a West
German League.

Beckenbauer, a two-time Euro-
pean Player of the Year, helped
guide the Cosmos to their third
North American Soccer League
championship in four years.

The Cosmos toppled the Fort
Lauderdale Strikers 3-0 on Sun-
day to capture the Soccer Bowl in
Washington’s R.F.K. Stadium.

Beckenbauer, known in Europe
as “Der Kaiser’ joined the
Cosmos in 1977 when he was ac-
quired from Bayern-Munich of
Germany, a team he captained.
He promptly made his mark in
the league later that year when

he was voted the N.A.S.L.’s Most
Valuable Player.

While with the Cosmos,
Beckenbauer was converted to
the midfield from his backfield
position of “‘libero’’—or sweeper,
so that Brazilian star Carlos
Alberto could play that position.

Beckenbauer was never really
happy playing there, however,
and told the New York Times
Monday “‘I always felt more com-
fortable as a sweeper.”

While Warner Communica-
tions, owners of the Cosmos in-
duced him to bring his elegant
style to the U.S. three years ago,
pressure from the Adidas spor-
ting goods firm of West Germany
convinced him to return.

Recently voted the most
popular person in West Germany,
the three-time captain of the
European World Cup Team told
the Times, ‘‘I am happy to leave
this country as a champion.”

Spikers lose first 4 matches;
Grieb sees improvement ahead

By JEFF CROSS

The women’s volleyball team
stumbled to an 04 start by losing
a pair of tri-matches this week.

Tuesday the Bisons traveled to
Franklin and Marshall where
they lost to the host Diplomats,
3-15, 14-16, 3-15. The win raised
F&M’s record to 2-1.

The spikers next challenged
powerful Delaware. The Blue
Hens were Division II regional
champions last season and went
to the NCAA championship tour-
nament. Coach Terrie Grieb
noted, “The girls felt we had
nothing to lose and everything to
gain.”

Although it was their first
match, Delaware’s skill and ex-
perience was obvious in the first
set as Bucknell fell 15-4.
However, the Bisons’ blocking
improved and the spikers jumped
out to an 11-6 lead in the second
set. At this point, the Bisons ‘‘fun-
damentally stopped talking and
hustling,” according to Grieb,
and Delaware rallied to take the
set 15-11.

The Bisons also started fast in

the third set, using dinks effec-
tively to gain an 8-5 lead.

On the verge of a comeback,
Grieb noticed, ‘‘We began to com-
mit mental errors such as two
people going for the same ball.”
Delaware took advantage and
overtook the Bisons, winning the
final set 15-8.

Grieb said, ‘‘We should have
won the second and third sets,”
but, ‘“‘the team played 85 percent
better than on Saturday so the
Delaware match was definitely a
moral victory for us.”

Delaware topped F&M in the
the third match of the tri-match.

Katie Hale ’83 played well as
setter while captain Susan
Bairstow ’81 and Ann Navasatka
’83 blocked well at the net, ac-
cording to Grieb.

On Saturday, the Bisons tra-
veled to Juniata where they lost
their opening match to Clarion
State, 11-15 and 7-15. Grieb com-
mented, ‘‘First game jitters were
a problem, but that’s not an ex-

cuse. We just didn’t move on the
court.”

The volleyballers were also
defeated by Juniata, losing 9-15
and 1-15. Grieb commented, “‘We
didn’t read and take advantage of
what their defense gave us. We
also didn’t use cross-court
spikes.”

Grieb praised Susan Atkinson
81 who “‘played the best games of
her life.”’ Alison Wellington 783
also played well, the coach said.

Juaniata beat Clarion, 2-0, in
the third match.

The spikers travel to Wash-
ington, D.C. Saturday where they
play Catholic University for the
first time ever. Grieb expects
Catholic to be ‘‘tough competition
since they have an established
program.”

The coach is optimistic that the
squad will improve, noting,
“We’ve shown better team play
and we're playing to the level of
our competition.”’

Harriers topple two more foes

By ROBBY STETZ
Depth was once again the key as the men’s
cross country team edged Rutgers, 26-33, and
Manhattan, 23-38, last Saturday in New York to
extend its unbeaten streak to 67 meets.

After placing only two runners in the first
seven positions, the Bison harriers took the next
six spots to decide the meet. Bob Peterson of
Manhattan placed first in 25:05 and was followed
by Bill Reifsnyder ’84 in 25:25. Steve Bigotto ’82
was sandwiched between three Rutgers runners
and placed fifth in 25:44.

At this point, the outcome of the race was still
in doubt. However, the next six racers all wore
orange and blue, and the Bisons’ six year streak
was safe. Mark Hulme ’83 and co-captain Rick
Sayre 82 tied for eighth place in 26:08. They
were followed by senior co-captains Mike
Debraggio and Jim O’Shea who tied for tenth in
26:15. Freshman Jeff Hines took twelfth in 26:20
while Glenn Gibney ’83 placed thirteenth in
26:22.

The Bisons showed the importance of running

in a pack. According to coach Art Gulden, ‘“‘Hav-
ing a runner finish in first place is important, but
not as important as keeping the pack together
and near the front.”

Gulden was also impressed with the three
Bison co-cptains, stating, “I was definitely pleas-
ed with the way they ran. They have improved
immensely.” All three have been hampered with
nagging injuries this season.

The harriers are idle until October 4 when they
host ECC rivals St. Joseph’s, Lehigh and Tem-
ple. St. Joseph’s is considered among the Bisons’
toughest challengers for the ECC title.

Despite the closeness of the first two meets,
Gulden remains confident. He comments,
“Many people are surprised that we haven’t
been dominating our opponents like we did last
year. I’m not distressed. We've had a tough early
schedule and our runners have not performed
anywhere near their potential. And yet, we’re
still unbeaten.”’

Booters top Gettysburg, 3-0;
are shut out by Lock Haven

By BOB DAVIS

“we're definitely the under-
dogs,” was the comment of men’s
soccer coach Craig Reynolds
prior to the Bisons’ 1-0 setback
against Lock Haven State College
at Lewisburg Tuesday night.

The loss, which dropped the
booters’ record to 1-1, was mark-
ed by a deliberate ball-control of-
fense on the part of the Eagles,

who are ranked first in Division -

Ill. Reynolds had described the
visitors as a “big, strong, quick,
offensive-minded squad,” and
added that the Bison’s would re-
quire a ‘‘tight man-to-man
defense and a quick counter to
pin Lock Haven’s backs down.”
The bulk of the first half was
played as Reynolds had dictated,

highlighted by good end-to-end
action but relatively few real
scoring threats. The Bison game
plan was effective in thwarting
the Eagle attack, but at the same
time prohibited Bucknell from
applying sustained pressure in
close.

A Lock Haven corner kick with
slightly more than 16 minutes in
the half resulted in the best scor-
ing opportunity by either team to
that point. The ball was chipped
high towards the Bucknell goal
and descended into a pack of
bodies before being cleared out to
the wing ina flurry of feet.

The Bison’s defense began to
get a little sloppy late in the half
and it almost cost them. Lock
Haven continued to apply

Water polo shooting

By DAVE KIRKPATRICK

Coach Dick Russell calls them
“The most talented team ever to
play at Bucknell.’’ Team
members’ tee-shirts proclaim,
“Awesometicity.”” They’re all
referring to the 1980 version of
the men’s water polo team.

The squad is fresh from a 28-2-1
record last spring that
culminated in a fifth place finish
at the NCAA Championship Tour-
nament in Long Beach, Califor-
nia. The Bisons’ fifth place finish
is the highest any team from the
East has ever placed in the
history of the tournament. The
University of California at Santa
Barbara won the title with UCLA
finishing second.

Bucknell also captured the
Eastern Championships for an
unprecedented third year in a
row.

Led by captain Scott Schulte
81, the Bisons will attempt to top
last season’s amazing finish.
Russell calls Schulte, ‘‘One of the
top water polo players ever pro-
duced in the East.” Last season,
Schulte scored 121 goals and was
selected as a second team All-
America, the only player from
the East to be so honored. After a

summer of intense training with
top players on the west coast,
Schulte, called ‘‘The Bomber”’ by
his teammates, will be set to take
on superstar status.

Tom Butler ’82 plays “the
hole,” a passing position, and Fr
the most improved player on the
team,” according to Russell.
Last season, Butler contributed
34 goals and 24 assists.

Mark Gensheimer ’81 handles
the inside water with skill. He us-
ed his power to score 74 goals and
51 assists last year. Two years
ago he left the broadcast booth to
join the Bisons in the pool and
eventually made the game-
saving interception which pro-
pelled Bucknell into their first
NCAA tournament.

Senior Peter Weiman is the
“heart of the squad,”’ commented
Russell. Weiman possesses one of
the most accurate and powerful
arms in the East, according to
the coach.

Tony Paxton ’81 is the return-
ing goaltender, whom Russell
calls “the very best in the East.”
Last season, Paxton stopped
almost 60 percent of the shots
fired his way.

pressure and managed a quick
shot that was ticketed for the cor-
ner, but goaltender Pete Puccia
81 made a tough stop to keep the
game scoreless.

Undaunted, the Eagles kept the
heat on and it finally paid off.
With 4:55 left in the half, Robby
Gould beat Puccia for what prov-
ed to be the game’s only tally.

The Bison’s best chance of the
half came on a corner kick with
nine seconds remaining, but the
effort fell short.

The opening moments of the se-
cond half revealed that the
Eagles were not content to sit on
a one-goal lead. They completely
dominated the first ten minutes
of play in the period, taking the
play to the Bisons, who were
anything but aggressive and
were consistently beaten to the
ball.

The momentum began to shift
about midway through the half,
however, as the Bison’s suddenly
came alive. The booters’ passing
started to click, resulting in some
fine thrusts by forwards Duncan
Lee ’83 and Pat Christ ’82, and by
sophomore mid-fielder Mark
Brotherton.

The Bison’s best opportunity
came with just under one minute
to play. Bucknell was awarded a
direct kick when Bill Hibbs of
Lock Haven drew a red card and
was ejected for flattening a Bison
player near midfield.

Following a quick exchange of
clearing boots, Brotherton poked
the ball between two defenders
for a breakaway, but the ball got
too far in front of him where it
was easily corralled by the Eagle
goaltender.

Prior to the game, Reynolds
noted that the team needed
“more width on our attack; we’re
pinching too much in the mid-
dle.” He added that they needed
to “finish” on scoring oppor-
tunities. This problem was ap-

for return to

Mark Corl ’81 is a sprinter on
the men’s swim team, but, ‘‘if he
learns to put that speed to use,
he’ll be making a solid contribu-
tion,” Russell said.

parently not resolved in time for
the Lock Haven match, and may
have been the difference in the
game.

The Bison’s started their
season off on the right foot by
shutting out Gettysburg, 3-0, in
Friday night’s home opener.

Reynolds felt “as good about
that game as I have about any
game for some time,” adding
that the team played ‘“‘pretty
darned good—they controlled the
game.”

It took the booters just 45
seconds to get on the board when
sophomore Paul Devlin took a
cross inside from teammate
Brotherton and drilled it behind
the Gettysburg goaltender for a 1-
0 Bison edge.

The second Bison strike came
well into the second half, when
Brian Hassinger ’81 connected
following a series of short passes

this weekend when they travel to
Providence to face host Brown
University, UCLA and MIT.
Russell sees the tournament as a
good barometer of the squad’s
development, although he is hesi-

from Devlin and senior Tom
Rotelli.

Brotherton registered the final
Bison goal on a feed from Devlin
several minutes later. Reynolds
said of the Bison offense, “It’s
nice to get three (goals) — it'll
win a lot of games for you.”

Junior Paul Green racked up
the shutout, playing in place of
regular goalie Puccia, who was
resting an injured finger.

Reynolds had decided to rest
Puccia, who had suffered a bone
chip and tendon damage to a
finger. A special brace allowed
him to play, but he had not had
enough time to adjust his play by
Friday’s contest.

The Bisons will seek to raise
their record to 2-1 this Saturday
when they travel to West Chester
for a 4 p.m. game with the
Rams.

Colloquy guest
shocks with
‘mercy killing’

By S.A. HABETZ
and MATT KARANIAN

The speaker of the American
Medical Association told a
University Center Forum Au-
dience Thursday night that he
prescribed a “minimum” of
medical treatment for his own
mother and allowed her to die
rather than take drastic
measures to save her life.

In the opening speech of ““The
New Morality of Life and Death”
— the fall colloquy here — Dr.
William Rial said he gave his
mother one-sixth the standard
dosage of penicillin for people
with pneumonia and that she died
soon afterward.

He said he made a moral deci-
sion to allow her to die in peace
rather than try ‘‘to fight death
with science.” He said his parent
had lost control of her bodily
functions and was “‘going senile.”

Rial said he delayed prescrib-
ing any medication until pressure
from staff members at his
hospital convinced him to give
her some penicillin.

She died soon after she was
given the minimal dosage, he
said.

The doctor explained his stand
on euthanasia during a lecture
entitled the ‘““AMA’s Stand on
Medical Ethics.”

Rial said he also broke an un-
written law of medical ethics
when he testified against another
doctor who he knew was prescrib-
ing quaaludes and speed
“without discretion.”

Fall Colloquy 1980, “The New Morality of Life and Death,”
began Thursday night with several film presentations and

William Rial speaks Thursday on the American

Medical Association’s stance on medical ethics.

Insaying he was ‘‘obligated”’ to
testify, Rial added he believed “‘a
sin of omission in testifying
against a colleague is as serious
asa sin of commission.”

He also said he refuses to issue
false letters of illness to workers
because they then would have no
way of knowing “I won’t lie when
it’s in (their) best interest.

“Physicians must tread the
thin wire of professional action
and social reality,” he said.

Asks for student activism

By GREG HAHN

In the first meeting of the Association of Bucknell Students this
semester, ABS President John Dzurinko ’81 outlined four items of con-
cern for his administration and called for student activism to help at-
tain specific goals.

A major topic of discussion was the newly-formed Committee on
Social Alternatives. Chaired by Assistant Dean of Student Affairs
Joseph Mammola, the group will investigate the origins and possible
effects of the stricter enforcement of the University alcohol policy.

The committee also plans to explore the possibility of using the
University Center’s vacant third floor as an area for student groups to
socialize in an alcohol-free environment.

Dzurinko also expressed the need for a committee of students, ad-
ministrators and members of the community to examine the Moore
Avenue and Route 15 intersection. A proposal to make the crossing
safer is needed, Dzurinko said. He added that engineering studies
should be made, such as one for an underground tunnel, which has
already been given a one-half million dollar price tag.

Dzurinko also called for a socially oriented curriculum, saying that
a student “‘shouldn’t be penalized through anxiety and frustration for
Jate curricular work when doing a student service.” He said that ‘“‘we
need a new concept of education, where the curriculum serves a
greater role in the community.”

He also encouraged members of the ABS Congress to become in-
volved in the Student Roundtable, composed of leaders from the
various campus organizations.

Dzurinko also said that the students—and the ABS in particular—
should have more involvement in the selection of commencement
speakers. Presently, President Dennis O’Brien chooses a faculty
member and a parent to address the students, and Dzurinko said he is
meeting with O’Brien Tuesday to determine whether more student in-
put can be incorporated.

Later in the meeting, Richard Pisano ’82 of the Finance Committee
informed the Congress of possible tuition increases next year. For
juniors, the figure could be $900 while other undergraduates might
have a $750 additional expense.

Marts garbage burning halts

as recycling policy reverses

By KEN WOLCKENHAUER

Incineration of garbage was
recently stopped in Marts Hall as
a result of a reversal in the
University’s policy on recycling.
The dust and pollution which
usually eminates from the
smokestack there has ceased.

In response tc complaints
from students, the Recycling
Club, and adverse publicity in the
Bucknellian last year, the
physical plant analyzed its waste
disposal policies from both a cost
and environmental point of view,
according to Superintendant of
Buildings Robert Millward.

Garbage collected on campus
in the past was burned either at
the physical plant or in Marts
Hall. Because office materials
from Marts and the library often
contained pollutants such as
plastics which adversely affect
air quality, these materials have
been rerouted from the in-
cinerators to an Allenwood land-
fill.

The significance of this
development, according to the

Recycling Club, is that this is the
first step toward a new Universi-
ty waste policy which emphasizes
conservation and environmental
protection as well as eventual
cost efficiency.

“We're really very pleased
with this change,’ noted
Millward. “We realized that we
had been paying someone to sit
by the burners while the garbage
burned, and all we have to do now
is pack it up and take it to the
landfill.”

Millward said he was also
pleased that the physical plant is
rto longer disturbing the com-
munity with black smoke and its
accompanying odors.

Incineration was considered
the cheapest, easiest and most
environmentally safe way to
dispose of the waste until recent-
ly, according to Millward. “After
all, the landfill has its limits,” he
said.

The change came because the
quantity being burned was
recognized as a “very significant
amount,” which could cause a

potential health hazard.

The administration has ex-
pressed concern, however, that
collection will not be done effec-

New report on bookstore filed

By DAVID HAWKINGS

An independent report by
University Bookstore liaison
Jackson Hill released this week
appears to have placated both the
store’s management and the
faculty committee that has been
working to make improvements
at the store.

The report both agrees with the
Bookstore Advisory Committee
that an increase is needed in the
stock of academic ‘‘trade books’”’
and supports the contentions of
Manager Warren Elze that the
store’s ‘‘emporium’’ must re-
main if the store is to survive
financially.

Hill — an associate professor of
music appointed in June to under-
take his own study of the opera-
tions at the University — said in
his 17-page report that “The

management’s perspective is ac-

tually far closer to the faculty’s
than most faculty would think.”

Hill’s suggestions differ most
from the report of the six faculty
advisory committee in asking
that only $10,000 be allocated for
the formation of an enlarged
stock of ‘‘quality” trade books
and classical records.

The report of the committee
made public Sept. 8 specified
$30,000 as the amount that should
be spent.

“That’s asking a bit much,”
Hill said in an interview Wednes-
day, adding that the larger
amount was equal to two begin-
ning faculty salaries here.

Hill said his job was to find an
“appropriate balance between a
realistic and appropriate way’’ to
run the bookstore.

“An assumption is that we are
doing this primarily for the

students,” he said. “A store
designed primarily for the facul-
ty would be a bigger mistake than
leaving things the way they are
now.”

In calling for an enlarged book
department — with a minimum
of space equal to what now exists
for non-textbook items at the
store — Hill said other books and
“fast-sell” items should not be
discontinued as a result.

“Tf Harold Robbins belongs in
the bookstore, then certainly
Shakespeare does too,”’ he said.

In one of the most strongly-
worded paragraphs of the
memorandum, Hill said “‘having
Monarch Notes on campus is
reprehensible’ and ‘‘should be
eliminated” from the store.

He likened them in the inter-
view to the pornographic
magazine Hustler, saying the

refusal to sell either would be a
statement ‘‘of taste, not cen-
sorship.”’

But the growing controversy
concerning the sale of study aids
at the store appeared to have no
easy resolution, with neither Elze
or the faculty members changing
their opinion and with no one ap-
parently knowing who would
make the final decision on the
matter.

Both Elze and Bookstore Ad-
visory Committee Chairman Bar-
bara Shailor praised the report,
which Shailor called ‘‘a fine com-
plement to the work we did.”

Elze said the Hill publication
was ‘‘an objective piece of
work,’’ but he reiterated his com-
ment that the committee’s report
was ‘‘not constructive or objec-
tive.”

Shailor said Elze’s remarks

JACKSON HILL

about parts of the group’s report
being ‘trash and nonsense” —
printed in last week’s Buck-
nellian — were ‘‘counterproduc-
tive,’ “not tactful’ and would
“not contribute to better com-
munication between the faculty
and the store.”

Ross solicits suggestions for
dining service improvements

By SUSAN MacDONALD

In an effort to solicit responses from students, the
University Dining Service, under the direction of
Henry (Hank) Ross, recently placed comment
cards on cafeteria tables.

Ross said he likes to hear student suggestions. “I
wish all the students would feel that way; we are
very receptive. Unfortunately,” he said, ‘“‘we didn’t
get too many good jokes.” However, there were
many requests for items such as low-calorie salad
dressings and fresh fruits.

Some of the comments did not concern the food,
but rather the lunch line crowds. One person sug-
gested only students with fast passes be allowed in
the cafeteria from 11:50 a.m. to 12:15p.m.

Another student said the cafeteria should be
opened at 11:15 a.m. as a way to eliminate the
crowds. Ross said he will post some of the many
suggestions he received on the bulletin board out-
side the cafeteria doors with his replies.

The ABS Dining Room Committee also offers a lot
of constructive criticism, Ross said. “It’s nice to
have students who are interested and who take time
to try new ideas,” he added.

The committee meets with Ross for about one
hour every other week ‘‘to just sit down, talk, and
decide which things should be changed. I really
wish I had more time to devote to that,” Ross said.

Members of the committee suggested placing
bread on the side tables as a way to avoid the bot-
tleneck of persons in line. Students also help plan
the special meals, and the comment card is student-
designed.

About 275 students work parttime in the cafeteria,

normally nine and a half hours a week. This year
they are working for pay, but in the past the work
was used in exchange for board. The switch was
made for several reasons, according to Ross.

As a paid position, the job can be included as part
of the Federal Work Study program. The change
also brings the Dining Service into line with other
paying jobs on campus. Student employees are re-
quired to take a full meal plan in the cafeteria,
however.

The dining service issued about 2200 meal tickets
this semester. The most popular plan is the 7-2 op-
tion, with which students eat two meals seven days
a week. Ross said that there has been little change
from last year in either lunch or dinner crowds.
They can almost always be predicted to within 75
students, he said.

“Breakfast, however, is up 200 to 250 more people
than last year,” Ross said. Attendance at late
meals, which are open to athletic teams, is up from
300 students last year to 450now. Greater participa-
tion in women’s athletics seems to have contributed
the most to this increase, Ross said.

The cafeteria does its best to provide a variety of
choices for the students, Ross said. Fish is available
every night, and the vegetarian meal plan is an op-
tion. Nearly 300 students have vegetarian meal
tickets.

Ross is hoping to have the vegetarian choice
placed on the computer for the next school year so
they would be printed on in the same manner as fast
passes are. Eventually he wants to offer the
vegetarian meal asa regular option on the menu.

ABS grants $9,700

to student organizations

The ABS Appropriations Committee announced Wednesday they
have awarded $9,700 in late and appealed appropriation requests to
seven student organizations.

The committee awarded 88 percent of the money requested by the
groups after a series of hearings at the University Center Sunday
night.

ABS Treasurer Pam Ecock ’82 announced the figures after receiv-
ing notification from University Controller Ellis Harley Wednesday
morning that the funds, derived from student activities fees included
in tuition, were well in excess of the amount appropriated.

Of the six student organizations requesting 1980-81 funds for the
first time, the Politics Club was the only group to be given all it re-
quested—an $800 stipend which will be used to help pay publishing
costs of the Medium of Exchange, a joint publication of the Politics
and Economics Clubs.

The Bucknellian—the only student organization to appeal its
\spring appropriation—received an additional $3975, which Editor Ken
Quaas ’82 said would be used primarily to offset an increase in printing
‘costs.

The Bucknell Dance Company was the hardest hit by the commit-
tee’s actions, receiving only $1115—or 63 percent—of the $1765 they
had requested to mount performances for this year.

The Bowling and Rifle Clubs received $540 and $360 for their
respective events, over 90 percent of what they had requested.

The Ice Hockey Club and Frisbee Club each received about 75 per-
cent of their total requests.

All other student organizations had been given appropriations
from the committee,after a weekend of hearings in May.

PHI BETA KAPPA LECTURE—Estelle Ramsey, professor of

Monday evening as this year's Phi Beta Kappa visiting

ditionally met stress with physical reaction, such as run-

tively, and added costs will en-
sue.

Millward said the paper bins on
campus are often overflowing,
and a professor complained that
it was inconvenient and a bother
to store large quantities of paper
or bring them to the physical
plant.

Although recycling has
previously been a voluntary ef-
fort, the University now seems to
be adopting it as a policy. Vice
President for Administration and
Finance John Zeller said that
despite his earlier skepticism
about costs, he will allow the
physical plant and the recycling
club to try this limited experi-
ment.

ABS president John Dzurinko
81 said, “The University has
recognized the serious aesthetic
problem and the disadvantage to
the entire community of not
recycling.”

He said the key to the success
of the program ‘“‘will be the inclu-
sion of custodians in the collec-
ting of materials and, in the long
run, the physical plant providing
for recycling.”

The Recycling Club has de-
tailed plans by which the Univer-
sity will adopt a full and efficient
waste disposal plan which will
focus on recycling.

First, the University’s paper
baler will be* renovated with
Recycling Club funds at a cost of
about $300. The machine will be
used in conjunction with the

League of Women Voters, who
are running a community recycl-
ing program led by Nora Elze,
assistant professor of physical
education here.

Second, the physical plant has
offered the two groups the use of
dumpsters not in service to aid in
the collection of recyclable
papers.

The Recycling Club has also
gained access to the Busser
Building on Market Street for use
as a headquarters. Elze worked
in collaboration with the club to
obtain the borough-owned
building which is now partly used
for glass recycling.

The goal of the club is to use
these developments to create a
system that will eventually lead
to the recycling of all paper. The
baler will save great amounts of
man power and make more
money.

The club currently bales paper
into small bundles by hand and is
paid $20 per ton for it by the
Staiman Bros. baling company of
Williamsport. It is then trucked
to a York recycling plant. With
the baler the club will be able to
get over $50 per ton.

Eventually they will pursue
their own contract with a recycl-
ing facility and receive direct
payments for the baled paper.

Bob Doms ’81, president of the
Recycling Club, said arrange-
ments will soon be made for col-
lection of paper from the two-
handed collectors the physical
plant will put in the administra-
tion buildings. He said the club
has 120 members now and should
be able to easily handle the
burden during the school year.

37 student groups participate
in Greek Weekend carnival

By MARY LISA MURGIANO

Greek Weekend was a “huge success”’ according
to Donn Zacune ’81, public relations officer for the
Interfraternity Council.

The sponsors of the events, the IFC and the
Panhellenic Council, are donating all proceeds from
the Weekend to charity. In excess of $2,000 was rais-
ed for the American Cancer Society in last Thurs-
day’s Swim-For-Cancer event.

Proceeds from other Greek Weekend activities
have not been tallied yet. The profits, however, will
be donated to the Listening Post, a counseling ser-
vice in the Lewisburg public school system. The
Listening Post employs several University
students.

According to Zacune, the weekend’s only problem
arose when a band, Alecstar, slated to perform at
the all campus party Saturday night, cancelled at 6
p.m. that evening. The IFC managed to engage a
band from Hazleton, White Water, on short notice.

There were no problems concerning the Universi-

Sectoberbest

ty’s new policy on alcoholic beverage consumption
on school property. Zacune said all alcohol was
served on private fraternity property.

More than 37 groups and organizations par-
ticipated in Greek Weekend Games Saturday. Of
them, Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority was the
overall winner. Kappa Delta Rho fraternity won the
volleyball competition, Phi Kappa Psi fraternity
won the frisbee throw and the 3rd Trax and 4th Har-
ris hall groups won the pyramid-building contest.
Other games which were not scored included tug-of-
war and earth ball.

Pi Beta Phi sorority won first prize in the banner
contest. The combined efforts of Phi Gamma Delta
fraternity and Beta Gamma sorority won second
place in that event.

As for next year’s Greek Weekend, Zacune said,
“Pl just make proposals and suggestions on how to
better organize it.”’ One suggestion that Zacune will
make is to have the games earlier in the semester,
before the study load increases.

Student groups work on

presidential

By MARY LISA MURGIANO

Student groups have been
working on the presidential cam-
paign here on campus and local-
ly. Groups campaigning for John
Anderson, Ronald Reagan and
Ed Clark, the Libertarian can-
didate have formed.

Reagan’s campaign on campus
is the most visible and organized

CAMPAIGN
UPDATE

to date and boasts a volunteer
force of 60-65 students. According
to Tom DeCain ’83, director of the
Bucknell College Republicans,
the group’s main job consists of
“finding out who’s voting for who
and persuading students to vote
for Reagan.”

DeCain, who worked at
Republican Headquarters as an
intern last January and attended
the National Convention in
Detroit said, “‘We have an en-
thusiastic bunch willing to put in
a lot of time.’”’ DeCain hopes that
“within the next few weeks’ his
group will be ‘‘out and working”
to get Reagan elected.

Anderson, the Independent
candidate for president, also has
a large following at Bucknell, but

campaigns

his campaign here lacks leader-
ship and unity.

Senior Bob Doms, who
previously coordinated the drive,
has stepped down from his posi-
tion and is looking for a succesor.
Doms noted that there are many
individuals currently working for
Anderson but there is no con-
certed group effort. ‘It’s difficult
to find leaders around here,”
Doms said.

He pointed out that much work
was done for the Anderson cam-
paign last semester, however.
Students circulated petitions to
get Anderson on the presidential
ballot and many contacted area
residents who were potential
Anderson supporters.

Ed Mastascusa ’84, is begin-
ning a drive for Libertarian can-
didate Ed Clark. Mastascusa,
who is the co-chairman of the
Northern Half of the 17th Con-

gressional District Libertarian.

Party, does not have widespread
support here, but had several
volunteers who worked over the
summer.

Mastascusa’s goal is to get
enough volunteers involved with
Clark’s campaign. “It would be
ideal to pass out between five and
10 thousand pieces of literature in
the area,”’ he noted.

There are no organized cam-
paign efforts for President Jim-
my Carter here at this time.

Senior gift drive begins with

publicity camp

By MADELON HENEHAN

The 1981 Senior Gift Drive is
under way, with its theme “We're
Building a Future.” The class of
1981 will begin its publicity cam-
paign for the fund drive next
week.

Officially, the 1981 drive will
begin on Oct. 14 with a kickoff
dinner in Larison Hall for approx-
imately 160 volunteers.

As in past years, senior
volunteers will solicit their fellow
classmates for a 10-year pledge
to the University. The money col-
lected during the decade will be
invested by the University’s in-
vestment counsellor, George
McGee.

At the end of the ninth year,
1990, a vote will be taken by the
class which will determine how
the money will be used.
Everyone donating to the fund
will be mailed a write-in ballot.
The donation will be presented at
the 1991 class reunion.

“It’s a nice way of saying
thank-you for all the good times
we've had here,” said Drive
Chairperson Jim Hollen ’81.

Since the program originated
in 1968, three class gifts have
been made. A total of $159,500
was collected for scholarships.

The main goal of the 1981 cam-
paign is to increase the percen-
tage of student participation over
last year, when 72 percent of the
seniors pledged. “‘We want to see
75 percent to 80 percent oi the

class involved,” said Hollen.

Other committee goals include
beating last year’s total pledge of
$102,000 and personally con-
tacting 100 percent of the class
before the drive’s end near
Thanksgiving.

The Senior Class Reunion Gift
Program is “prestigious” said
Hollen. In 1979, it received a
Special Merit Award presented
by the Council for Advancement
and Support of Education for

align next week

“Excellence in Programs and
Communications.”

Besides getting younger
classes involved in giving, the
program is noted for providing
“excellent training among young
alumni for future support in
capital and annual fund raising
campaigns,” Hollen said.

Colgate University and Dickin-
son, Lafayette, Lehigh and
Allegheny Colleges have all ex-
pressed interest in the prograin.

Turks protest to

stop British film

The Turkish embassy in Great
Britain is concerned about a new
film soon to be released by film-
makers there.

According to English sources,
the Turkish embassy has pro-
tested to the British Film Board
the proposed release of a film
called Gallipoli.

The film portrays events of the
unsuccessful British attempt to
invade the Turk mainland during
World War I. According to Turk
Officials, the film shows that
Turks behaved barbarically in
the course of the battle. The film
also refers to massacres the
Turks have committed over the
ages.

“For this reason, Ankara is in-
tervening to stop the showing of
the film,” said an official of the
Turkish embassy in London.

The GE plant the men entered

Daniel Berrigan was released

Dzurinko hopes to

hold town meetings

Lock Haven State College plans
to hold a ‘‘town meeting” on
topics of public concern this
week, and the ABS plans to bring
the concept here.

“What Lock Haven is doing is
important because they are
creating a sense of community in
the area,” said ABS President
John Dzurinko ’81. He said that
the participants will discuss pro-
blems, decide upon possibilities
to solve them, and offer a direc-
tion for effective action by the
community.

“We feel that all of these ideas
are important ones and we would
like Bucknell to start its own town
meetings,” Dzurinko said. He
mentioned the rapidly rising
Lewisburg tax rate as one major
concern.

Iraqi demonstrators
arrested in Danville

Five Iraqis were arrested in
Danville Monday and charged
with theft and criminal con-
spiracy after allegedly stealing
$140 from a service station there.

The Iraqi men were returning
home from an_anti-Iranian
demonstration at the Iranian em-
bassy in New York. They were en
route to Chicago and had stopped
in Danville for gasoline.

While at the gasoline station,
one of the men is alleged to have
removed money from a cash
drawer while a station attendant
filled the gas tank of his car.

Police apprehended the men
about two miles from the scene,
on Interstate 80. In addition to the
charges of theft and criminal con-
spiracy, one man was charged
with concealing offensive
weapons. He was carrying a
switchblade and an 18-inch
machete. He is being held in lieu
of $15,000 bail.

Accident victim’s
condition improves

Mary McNerney ’81, who was
struck by a car while crossing
Route 15 at Moore Avenue last
week, is still in the intensive care
unit of Geisinger Medical Center
in Danville. She is listed in
“serious’”’ condition, an improve-
ment over her condition of
“critical” late last week.

McNerney will probably re-
main in intensive care for
another week, according to
hospital officials. The full extent
of her injuries is not yet known.

John Zeller, vice president for
administration and finance, said
there is a need for additional
lighting at the intersection of
Route 15 and Moore Avenue. ‘‘I
have written a letter to the Penn-
sylvania Department of
Transportation and asked
whether they would permit the
University to install more
lighting at the intersection,’
Zeller said.

He also said the University
“would like to have a flashing
light in the south-bound lane on 15
in addition to the existing one in
the north-bound lane.”

The crossing signal for
pedestrians at the site of the acci-
dent was not working at the time
and has been repaired, according
to Major Robert Granley of the
East Buffalo Township Police
Department.

Screening begins
for security posts

Personnel Director Marion
Rose reports having received
“about 70” applications from per-
sons seeking to fill the two open-
ings in the security force here.

The vacancies on the security
force resulted when Vice Presi-
dent of Administration and
Finance, John Zeller, fired two
officers ‘‘for cause’ last week.
Zeller refused to comment fur-
ther on his reasons for discharg-
ing the two campus patrolmen.

University advertisement for
patrolmen calls for applicants
with ‘“‘a minimum of high school
or equivalent”’ schooling. It also
states ‘‘associate degree, armed
services, security and ‘safety
training’’ is preferred.

Physical Plant director John
Bell said he hopes to have a
Director of Security hired before
he fills the two vacant patrolman
positions. The new director would
replace the position left vacant
by Chief of Security Norman
Fine, who said he is retiring this
year.

Although applicants are being
screened now for both the direc-
tor and patrolman positions, Bell
would not comment as to when he
expects actual hiring to be com-
pleted. :

Cross: sideline prowler

By MARC ELLIOTT

You may have already seen her
this semester.

She prowls the sidelines in
Memorial Stadium on Saturday
afternoons.

Maybe you’ve noticed her
under the lights at a varsity soc-
cer game, or perhaps you’ve seen
a suspicious-looking person
wandering around the site of the
new computer center.

If you’ve noticed anyone mat-
ching these descriptions, then
you’ve probably seen Kate Cross

someone somewhere who wants a
picture of it.

Cross and her assistant Eileen
Jager put in 40 to 50 hours a week
shooting, developing and printing
their photographs, which find
their way into University public
relations pamphlets, Bucknell
World magazine and exhibits on
campus and in Lewisburg.

Cross first worked here as a lab
instructor of biology in 1978, after
attending Susquehanna Universi-
ty. Soon she began assisting in
the Audio-Visual department. “I

Cross is the official
photographer for the University’s
departments of Public Relations
and Media Services. This fall
marks her second semester as
the University’s top cameraper-
son, capturing sports and special
events on film.

It may at first sound like an
easy job, but Cross puts much
time into her efforts. ‘Last
semester I consistently pulled
one all-nighter a week, and have
so far this year, too,’’ said Cross.
“] just might be the most visible
person around because I’m at
almost every event on campus.”

Interaction and Diversity sponsors
discussion on alcohol policy changes

By TRICIA KENNEDY

Potential ramifications of the
University drinking policy were
among the major topics of discus-
sion at a meeting Sunday of
students and administration
leaders.

The meeting was sponsored by
Interaction and Diversity, and
was a forum for discussion bet-
ween Associate Director of
Residential Life Gerald Commer-
ford, Dean of Student Affairs
John Dunlop, ABS president John
‘Dzurinko ’81, members of the
committee and any student who
wished to attend.

Only three students attended
the meeting.

Dunlop said the much publiciz-
ed drinking policy is not entirely
new, but rather that there is now
a “new mode of enforcing’’ the
policy.

The need to ‘‘avoid liability for
University employees,’’ par-
ticularly residential directors
and resident assistants, is a
reason for stricter enforcement
of the alcohol policy, Dunlop said.

Dunlop said there has been
evidence of a ‘‘marked increase”’
of consumption of alcohol on
campus in recent years. The ad-
ministration sees drinking
becoming a ‘‘disproportionate
part of college life,” he said.

Part of the administration’s in-
tention in strictly enforcing the
alcohol policy is to encourage
students to develop a sense of
responsibility about their drink-
ing, according to Commerford.

“Bucknell has realized that
drinking is a way of life in our

society,” Commerford said, “‘but
what are you going to do to keep
from drinking yourself into trou-
ble?”

Dunlop and Commerford both
agreed there is a need for social
events on campus other than
those that feature alcohol. Sug-
gestions made by students at the
meeting included more study
breaks and ice cream parties,
dances and roller skating.

There was also a motion made
to open the third floor of the
University Center as a perma-
nent home for on-campus social

activities.

Such a center would help
students develop ‘‘a real sense of
community”’ that is lacking here,
Dzurinko said.

A committee is now being
formed to create social alter-
natives here. Dzurinko and
others emphasized the need for
students to have input into the
decisions of the committee. Stu-
dent groups should come up with
ideas for weekend and non-
weekend social functions,
Dzurinko said.

did a lot of passport pictures
there,”’ she said.

At the same time, Cross was
working as a free-lance
photographer for the Union Coun-
ty Journal. Her breakthrough in-
to full-time professional
photography occurred after a
football game against Boston
University last year.

There, Cross photographed
what she still calls her ‘favorite
shot,” featuring player Bruce
Keltie ’81 in mid-air. This picture
so impressed former Sports In-
formation Director Dennis
O’Shea that shortly afterward,
Cross was promoted to the posi-
tion of official University
photographer.

Since that time, little has
escaped Cross’ photographic eye.
An avid bicyclist, she has
photographed bicycle races,
horse races and even turtle
races.

A favorite subject is also
flowers, as she is motivated by
her biological studies — ‘‘that

tion;”” — she has also photo-
graphed hang-gliders and sky-
divers from the air. Cross calls
frisbee ‘ther favorite sport’ to
photograph, with football second.

Her photographic equipment is
basic — a 35-millimeter Vivitar,
wide-angle lens and a 200 or 300
millimeter lens for sports events.
“T rarely use special effects,”
Cross said. ‘‘My photos aren’t
pretty or artful — they’re useful.

ill, it’s a lot more fun to take
pictures than to develop them in
the darkroom.”

Part of the reason for this is the
“rather severe problem’’ in-
volved in sharing darkroom
facilities with University faculty
and student clubs. “It’s a big
fight for space — everyone wants
more room.’’ Cross is optimistic
about a proposed Media/Com-
munications center at the Univer-
sity, but adds “‘it’s still probably
five years or so away.”

A painter as well as a
photographer, Cross explained
the differing philosophies bet-
ween the two art forms: ‘In
photogrphy, everything is there
already. The situation presents
itself and you have a given time
to capture it. It’s very intense —
when it’s over, it’s gone. The
hardest thing to do is concen-
trate, you have to be just a pair of
eyes.””

One thing students can be sure
of is that little will escape Cross’
camera this semester.

“T think the best thing to take
pictures of is people,” said Cross.
“You can make friends with
anyone if you take their picture.”
So don’t be surprised if you see a
camera aimed at you some Satur-
day afternoon in Memorial
Stadium — it’s just Kate Cross,

Better than book money

The University Bookstore has become the target of some heavy
faculty fire. They contend that our bookstore isn’t; it is instead a
novelty drugstore — an emporium — the Rea and Derick of the
University Center.

To investigate these persistent accusations, President O’Brien ap-
pointed Jackson Hill as a faculty liaison as well as a six-member
faculty committee. Hill’s conclusions are interesting and construc-
tive while at the same time supportive of the committee’s critical
contention that the store is not the haven for knowledge they say it
should be.

While the bookstore is no library of classic literature, it is much
more than a showcase of shlock. It provides the everyday needs,
some of the extras and even some of the unwanted.

The Hill memorandum recommends that the bookstore increase
classical book and record offerings and deemphasize the high-
turnover novelty items by taking the former and placing them in the
eye-catching spots where the latter have been. This is fine. Hill also
recommends that $10,000 be invested in improving the ‘quality
book”’ selection — a more realistic sum than the $30,000 asked for by
the advisory committee.

While this suggestion is well-intentioned, we think it is misdirected
in priority. After a week of contemplating calculus, engineering or
Tolstoy, most students will not read a bookstore-bought copy of
Paradise Lost on the weekend. Forget it.

Why not put the $10,000 into the library? If a student is interested
in doing some ‘‘good”’ reading, surely he should be able to find what
he wants there. If he wants his own copy — and is willing to pay the
premium price of purchase — he can order anything through the
bookstore.

The concern for image and self-betterment should be directed not
at the bookstore, but at Bucknell’s most pressing need: the
establishment of social alternatives on campus not dependent on
alcohol — like Christy’s Gate. The $10,000 could also do much in this
direction. The quality of student life is more severely affected these
days by the confining social life than by an abundance of Snoopy
mugs at the bookstore.

Abroad support

From Harrisburg to Washington to Aix-en-Provence to Nepal, op-
portunities for off-campus academic credit abound. The University
itself organizes a program with its faculty almost every semester; it
also maintains ties both official and unofficial with a variety of other
programs both foreign and domestic.

Unfortunately, the University has been less than supportive of ef-
forts by both students and faculty to travel on Bucknell’s time, credit
and funds. Questions and objections by the administration about the
status of grades, credits, salaries, tuition and financial aid have
hampered a potential flourishing of a trend toward study elsewhere.

The establishment of a student, faculty and administration com-
mittee on off-campus study last year is a positive step; we hope they
succeed in solving the logistical problems put to it by the rest of the
University, and that the result will be a student body with a perspec-
tive enlightened by an international view.

No longer wasted

A reversal in the physical plant’s policies on waste disposal and
recycling deserves notice, for changes have been long in coming. No
longer will strolling students be subjected to the acrid smoke from
Marts Hall waste incineration operations. Now, the harmful
pollutants will be trucked to a safe landfill—at a savings.

The administration has also seen the merits of encouraging
recycling when cost efficient. In keeping with the ever-increasing
problem of dwindling resources, recycling is the first step in plan-
ning for the realities of the future. All that remains for the Recycling
Club and other concerned groups to accomplish is to instill the same
spirit in the average student, who could care less about throwing
away scrap paper.

More motivation for recycling— such as a special fund for recyc-
ling savings to be applied towards student activities and more
recycling bins, etc.—are clearly necessary.

Bookstore should continue catering to the students

By KRIS FORSYTHE

Warren Elze, manager of the
University Bookstore, is entirely
correct when he states that the
faculty ‘‘must realize this is a
bookstore and not a library,” as
he did in last week’s Bucknellian.
The bookstore does, of course,
sell books, hence the name.
However, once course books are
purchased, one cannot expect
students to be attracted se the

bookstore solely for ‘‘intellec-
tual’ reading material.

After being inundated by
engineering, calculus, political
theory and the myriad other
“quality” subjects of study, the
“serious” student needs a bit of
entertainment. The bookstore of-
fers a convenient and basically
well-stocked display of such
material.

When the committee refers to
“too much plain junk,” I do hope
it is not including science fiction
and bestsellers as targets of its
complaint. Many serious social
commentaries such as Brave
New World and 1984, have been
written by masters of science fic-
tion, and both were “‘best-
sellers.” It is not fair to condemn
a whole literary category —
“junk” is found in all disciplines,

even in highly intellectual ones.

The bookstore does not just
contain only course books and
best-sellers. There are many
books in many different fields:
biographies of famous people,
works by Freud and Fromm, and
writings on travel, cooking,
mechanics...the list, like the
selection, is rather extensive.

ningham as his executive assistant upon her graduation from Harvard
15 months ago.

After less than a year with Bendix, she was promoted to vice presi-
dent for corporate and public affairs, and last week she received the
controversial promotion to vice president of strategic planning.

Cunningham graduated from Wellesley College in 1973 and was an
assistant treasurer at Chase Manhattan Bank before attending
graduate school.

The career path seems to be that of a young corporate superstar—if
the employee was a man. The media coverage and intra-company in-
nuedo demonstrates that, despite claims of equality, young women
still face difficult obstacles in their climb up the corporate ladder.

Bucknell women should question interviewers about how their com-
pany really treats women. On the average, how long do women stay
with the company? What is the company’s record of promoting
women? What type of prejudices are women subject to in their com-
pany?

The answers to such questions should give the student an idea of
what to expect if they go to work for the firm. The interviewer may
give sincere answers, but they may answer with stereotyped, water-
cooler-type-joke lines.

On Monday, Cunningham asked for a leave of absence from her new
job, because she felt that her managerial effectiveness had been
diminished becalise of the publicity resulting from her promotion.
However, on Wednesday a committee of the Bendix board of directors
rejected her proposal and gave her their unanimous vote of con-
fidence. Hopefully a positive precedent has been set. Employees
should be judged solely on their job performance, not their sex or age.

professor is concerned about
their dishonest use, he or she
should be clever enough to ex-
amine students on material
learned only by reading the book
itself.

Finally, the committee might
take into consideration that even
if the bookstore did stock these
“quality” books, the students
would, in all likelihood, not buy
them. Face it, when one has had a
rough week, one would much
rather read a light, ‘“‘easy-
reader’ novel than The Grapes of
Wrath. If a “quality” book is
desired, one is more likely to bor-
row it from the library than buy it
from the bookstore. If a specific
book is desired, there is always
the ‘‘special order.”

Instead of a $30,000 financial
commitment to the bookstore,
why not give the money to the
library? In this way, a quality
book would be available to the en-
tire campus rather than only to
the one who buys the book, and
the bookstore could sell the less-
intellectual material so that
students would have a choice.

By not offering a variety of
material, it is quite possible that
students will reject the only
material offered as a matter of
principle, and thus defeat the en-
tire purpose of an ‘‘intellectual’’
atmosphere.

variety of experiences t

Jean-Claude Giffard of Deauville, France, is assisting French professors during
his year on campus. Giffard will be called upon to give a native's point of
view on the French language and culture.

Campus life is agreeable
to student from France

By SHARI HOLMES

An exchange system between Bucknell and the University of Caen has brought to
campus Jean-Claude Giffard, a native of France who makes his home in Deauville on the
English Channel.

At 24 years old, Giffard is in his fifth year of study in France and has two more years
remaining before he receives his Ph.D. While at Bucknell, he is not taking any courses
for credit, though he attends some ‘“‘just to have a look.” ;

His main responsibility is to assist the French professors with their classes. Working a
total of 14 hours a week, he helps with French 103, French 104, French 270 and leads a
class in conversational French. In these classes, Giffard presents the Frenchmen’s point
of view and opinions, which are useful in trying to understand French culture.

Having travelled extensively throughout Europe since the age of six, Giffard is no
novice at adjusting to different cultures. ‘I lived in London for two years and know the
British style of life. I’m used to changing from one culture to another.” Although he says
that Europe provides more different cultures and lifestyles in a smaller area than the
U.S. and his original plan was to study in Dublin, Giffard is “very glad it worked out this
way.”

Despite his former traveling experiences, Giffard describes America as a ‘‘new
world.”’ When asked if adjusting to the American lifestyle is difficult, he said, ‘I avoid
the thought that my own culture is the best.”

Giffard does, however, find many differences between American and French univer-
sities. The most noticeable was the age difference between him and the students here. In
France, the “universities” are strictly for graduate work. Here, he was surprised to find
undergraduates of a younger age than him.

Another surprise was the rigor of academics here. ‘To me, you're all working like
mad,” he said. Giffard says that courses here are far more structured than those in
France, and the emphasis professors place on attendance is also different. In France, a
student is not obliged to attend classes; the main emphasis is instead placed on passing
the exam at the end of the course.

One less than pleasant aspect of his stay on campus seems to be the cafeteria food.
When asked to compare it with his own in France, he paused a moment and said delicate-
ly, “It’s edible.”

Giffard’s plans include taking an active part in the French Club, and planning French
meals for club members and guests. He is also continuing his hobby of photography by
working for the L’Agenda.

Although he has not traveled around the U.S. as yet, Giffard is planning to visit Mon-
treal for Thanksgiving, and during the semester hopes to make trips to New York City.
Also planned for January is a trip through the southwest, including California. “It is best}
to see as much of a new country as one can,” he said.

Semester abroad gives a new

The students enrolled in the London semester
were sitting in a bar on the upper level of the Pan
American terminal at Kennedy International Air-
port in New York City. There were about 20 of us at
that point. Surveying the group, it occurred to me
that I only knew two of them. It was therefore odd to
consider that in the next four months I would get to
know the people accompanying me to England bet-
ter than anyone else I knew at Bucknell.

Initially, the notion of living in a small London
hotel with 30 of my fellow students had not been ap-
pealing. When I thought of living in Lewi8burg and
in a dorm yet another year, however, I knew it was
time for a change.

My judgment proved correct; it was impossible
not to form a deep attachment to the people I shared
my semester abroad with. The closeness that
developed between the inhabitants of the
Sutherland Hotel proved to be the best aspect of
what turned out to be the most liberal educational
experience of my life.

Last semester’s program was one of a number of-
fered for studying abroad. Dennis Baumwoll and
Karl Patten, associate professors of English, led the
group.

Immediately after arriving, we began to settle in-
to a routine. Classes were held on Tuesday, Wednes-
day and Thursday, which left the remaining four
days free for studying. Of course, there were many
times when we’d put aside the books and venture
about the streets of the city. It was impossible to
become bored

“The education we got was not so much from the
books and classes, but more from just being there.
Taking everything London had to offer, and
everything we had to offer each other, we learned so
much more,’’ is what junior Sylvia Sukop says of
her semester abroad.

With an average of 300 different films and 100 dif-
ferent plays available each week, the ennui that
sometimes overtakes students in Lewisburg was
non-existent. Months could be spent just wandering
through the open markets and historical sites wat-
ching and conversing with different people of Lon-
don, eccentrics included.

“A streetcleaner told us that Princess Anne was

Abroad deadline draws near

ee

WALTER ODRONIC

A

By ANNE PAVUK

For those students who are
thinking of spending a semester
abroad or in Washington, now is
the time to act. Walter Odronic,
director of overseas studies, has
expressed concern that students
don’t “‘plan enough in advance to
spend a semester abroad.”

The fall deadline is Oct. 15 and
each student must have the ap-
proval of the. university in the
country in which he is interested
in addition to approval here.

The criteria by which students
are chosen for the program are
two-fold. First, a student should
arrange for an interview as soon
as possible with Odronic. He then
will be given three forms to fill
out, including personal data, a
statement of purpose and an ap-

proval or recommendation form
to be completed by a professor.

A committee comprised of
Odronic, John Pyper, associate
dean of the College of Arts and
Sciences; Robert Chambers,
dean of the College of Arts and
Sciences; John Murphy,
associate professor of English;
Alian Grundstrom, chairman of
linquistics and French; Susan
Fischer, assistant professor of
Spanish, and student represen-
tative David Hawkings ’82
evaluate the academic merit of
each program proposal, and
decide if other universities’
abroad programs, as well as
some non-traditional student
created programs, can be given
credit at Bucknell. The commit-
tee is also responsible for the ac-

creditation of University spon-
sored programs.

The study abroad program in-
cludes most countries around the
world. Odronic emphasizes that
this is not an exchange program,
as all of the universities abroad
are American. Nevertheless,
students whose classes will be
taught in English must still have
at least an elementary knowledge
of the language of the country
they are visiting. Odronic strong-
ly advises two semesters of a
foreign language at Bucknell in
preparation for going abroad.

The program is open to first
semester seniors and juniors who
may go overseas for one
semester or the entire year, and
to second semester sophomores if
they are language majors.

Going to France combines sightseeing
with academic and cultural instruction

By ALLISON ABOUCHAR

For the past five years, students here have been visiting France
for three weeks in January. This program was first begun as a
preparation for students majoring in French to live abroad second
semester, but has since broadened to include others as well.

“This program was primarily designed for French majors who
will study in France second semester, but any other students are
encouraged and welcome to come,” Professor Allen Grundstrom of
French and linguistics said. In the last two years, many non-majors
have attended.

Grundstrom continued, ‘These are people who have had some in-
terest in France, and they often choose to study the language when
they return because the trip makes it become more real.”

Travel arrangements, mapped out by the university, are in-
viting: the attractions of Paris, Versailles, Fontain Bleau and
Cathedral Chartres were all visited last year. Avignon and Aix-en-
Provence, the sites of the two Bucknell sponsored programs, were
on the itinerary as well. Recently, another University program for
second semester has been established in Paris.

This year, Marianna Mustacchi, director of the University’s
French program, and 25 students will take the trip. The $1,100 rate
includes hotels, breakfast, and all transportation — a bargain in
this day of inflation.

According to Rick Orth ’82, who spent last semester studying in
Aix-en-Provence, his experience in January was beneficial even
though he had been to France before.

“The January Program gave me the chance to orient myself with
the cities as well as warm up my French,” he said.

Grundstrom said the program allows students a fair amount of
free time, with scheduling of one major activity per day. ‘‘We’ve
had a fairly successful balance between organized and free time,”
he explained.

During free time, students attended movies, theater and
discotheques. These activities, both faculty and students agree,
provided valuable glimpses of French culture as well as the op-
portunity to practice the language.

Orth said he found it interesting that while visiting tourist attrac-
tions so many natives responded in English when he spoke to them.
He said this was because ‘“‘they like the opportunity to practice
English, not that they are snobby.”

Other students have similarly favorable reports of the people of
France. ‘‘They’re just like anyone else. Once you get to know them,
they’re very nice,” said Meredy Weir, ’82, who spent last semester
on the Avignon program. During this program, classes are con-
ducted entirely in French.

“The all-French classes were excellent. They help give a French
perspective and provide students good accents to follow,” said
Weir. The other programs, Aix-en-Provence and Paris, have
classes conducted in English as well.

Orth said that his university experience in France was not as
academically challenging as Bucknell, but he voiced an opinion
shared by many who have studied overseas. ‘‘Overall, with an
abroad experience, academics are secondary. I learned more
about myself, life, and another culture.”

Counseling service messages: he

By TODDG. BUCHHOLZ

I didn’t receive any letters in
my mail box this week. Even the
“What’s Happening” folks don’t
write anymore.

The Bucknell Counseling Ser-
vice, however, sent me a
brochure describing their new
telephone counseling system.
Everyone received a copy. It’s in-
triguing. You can use the service
to help solve problems ranging
from sexual to familial or just to
obtain information on a variety of
personal topics.

The discussions are prerecord-
ed and numbered. To listen to a
tape, just call 3788 and ask for the
appropriate number.

Although the idea of imper-
sonal, sterile tapes about per-

times to get an impression of how
the system works. On one of the

OPINIONS

I encourage students to use the
service. Even if you don’t have
any specific questions, some of
the tapes are entertaining. They
are a viable alternative to frater-
nity parties. Some problems in
the system are foreseeable,
however. And humorous or tragic
situations could develop.

For instance, the service is on-
ly open for certain hours. You can
be suicidal between 9 and 5, but
after that, you’ll have to settle for
physical intimacy. And there is
potential for purely technical dif-
ficulties.

I called a few days ago. I won’t
tell you for which number. A
woman answered:

“Good morning,
canI...”

Counseline,

A tape interrupted: ‘‘Sorry,
Counseline is not in operation
right now...”

The woman retorted: “That’s
not true, don’t listen to that.”

The tape continued. Both the
live woman and the prerecorded
woman kept talking to me. Final-
ly, I was able to listen to tape
number 74, which mediated the
debate between the two.

What will happen if Counseline
is overloaded, perhaps during ex-
am week when depression, ten-
sion and grief surpass the com-
mon cold in popularity? Those
poor counselors manning the
phones and tapes:

“Marge, get this guy the
depression tape.”

“J thought he was the gay one.”

“Just a minute Marge, I'll ask.
‘Sir, are you the suicide or the

he’s the drunkard.”

“But I gave the boozer tape to
that girl. Why didn’t she tell me it
wasn’t the right one?”

“Marge, she’s the girl who
can’t say no.”

“Hey, some guy just called for
the phone number of the girl who
can’t say no.”

The idea of telephone tapes is
fascinating and seminal. Maybe
the counseling service could
publish a top 10 list each week.
My vote goes to number 491,
suicidal crisis. A group of people
scream into the phone:

“DON’T DO IT!! WHAT ARE

Art professor Lasansky
opens at Center Gallery

By WILLIAM WALZ

Eighteen works of art in cast bronze,
steel and terra cotta will be featured in an
exhibit in the Center Gallery. They are re-
cent works of William Lasansky, sculptor
and professor of art at the University.
Lasansky also plans to display the
photographs of nine clay models for future
translation into bronze or stone sculpture.

In 20 years, the artist’s sculpture has
progressed from realistic in-the-round por-
traits and figures, such as his imposing
“&] Cid” on horseback, to more abstract
and figurative sculpture, characterized by
seemingly pliable sheets and shields about
a realistic face. His more recent cast
bronze sculpture is figurative in imagery,
much of it bearing the influence of his
previous forged and welded work: the
bronze appears layered or bent like sheets
of steel.

The technique of relief, which he
employs, offers a visual surprise and an in-
‘sight into form as well as a thematic state-
ment. From the front the sculpture ap-
pears swelling with form to create an illu-
sion of mass, while a view from behind
often exposes the hollowness of the piece.

Thematically, this technique suggests
the shallowness of the visage and the
discrepancy between what is shown to us
and what is there. It could be understood to
symbolize man’s tendency to disguise or
mislead for defense or retreat. One
realizes the superficial nature of the hard
armor and can look from the inside out to
be reminded of the humanity behind the
armor.

Although his metal sculpture tended
toward relief, an acute sense of depth was
maintained, particularly in the facial area
where the sheets cast strong shadows and
created pockets and pouches inviting the
eye to explore. Most recently, Lasansky’s
interests have moved to the surface where
he has concentrated on patination, texture

Bucky’s Place

will premier

and composition. Many plaques in this
show bear witness to these more graphic
interests.

Much of Lasansky’s artwork represents
‘figures with drawn, dejected, even
distorted faces. They are beleaguered by
their very garments; thick rainwear, op-
pressive suits of armor with chingards and
visors applied in patches nearly smother
them. Taking refuge in these metal sheets,
only their faces are exposed, reluctantly, it
seems, since they never look out with in-
terest. Some have retreated further — into
sleep.

It seems Lasansky has sculpted
characters of a nation having lost a war.
There is a prisoner of war in chains, evena
young girl in a helmet, but most of his
figures are exhausted refugees conveying
a strong sense of isolation and loneliness.

Less obvious is an underlying sense of
primitive ritual in Lasansky’s work. His
“Stella” portrays a helmeted face and
hand protruding upward from an altar-like
box in gesture of pagan worship. Raised
patterns are repeated symmetrically on
the altar piece suggesting further its
ritualistic undertones. ‘Plague IX,” de-
picting a warrior’s face, has a head-piece
with stripes painted for the rite of war or
worship. Lasansky’s helmets do not seem
strong enough for combat, the impression
is that these are masks or disguises for
mock battles of ritual. His “Helmet” is a
striking mask of no military value; one
rather expects it to be worn in a dance
around ‘‘Stella.””

The artist’s fascination with lost civiliza-
tion and the past influence some of his
earlier works, but visits to Central
America and a trip in 1972 to Maya Indian
sites in Mexico have focused his interest
from the medieval to the Mayan. The In-
dian influence on his work lies deeper than
imagery and detail, and he seems to have
a Mayan sense.

William Lasansky, professor of art at the University, examines his sculpture
“Diana and Muffin” just after placing it in the Center Gallery. Lasansky's
works will be exhibited in the Gallery until Oct. 29.

The intriguing ‘(Garden Column”
presents Eve’s temptation of Adam as a
relief sculpted into a column and capped
with a serpent whispering into her ear. The
Mayan culture’s influence goes beyond
Eve’s flattened Indian nose. It is in the
ominous presence of the tropical snake —
the only fully-Sculpted element of the piece
— that their civilization is symbolized.

Lasansky is currently at work on a
granite piece remotely resembling an an-

vil but looking somehow very Mayan.
Without employing telltale facial features
or symbols, he is summoning through form
something almost impossibly elusive —
the essence of Mayan sculpture.

Lasansky’s work will be shown through
Oct. 29, with an opening reception tonight
from 6 to 8 p.m. The Center Gallery in the
University Center is open from 12:30-4:30

By ROBIN MEREDITH

Marguerite Miller, Lewisburg resident, joined
the University faculty this fall when her classes
in the Suzuki method of violin instruction were
incorporated into the curriculum. The Suzuki
method, subtitled ‘‘the mother tongue method,”
is based on the theory that a child can learn to
play any instrument as soon as he can unders-
tand his native language provided he learns ear-
ly enough, usually at age two or three.

Having taught children in the area for the past
four years, Miller proposed last spring that the
program be adopted in the fall to provide a
teaching situation for music education majors,
who will observe how each new student starts
out, using video tape sessions to record the
year’s progress. The first of these sessions will
begin next week with Cathy Miller ’82 narrating.

Miller expressed the opinion that her program,
consisting of 24 private students, would probably
benefit from the move.

“The number of students I can teach cannot
expand unless I have an assistant. I meet with
each student three times a week for half an hour,
two of the sessions being private and one a group
class so they can learn to play musically with
others.’’ The sessions take up most of her time,
although she already has one assistant working
with her this semester.

The opportunity, according to Miller, could en-
courage more music education majors to enter
the field because teaching the Suzuki method is a
full time occupation.

‘“‘With the teaching situation the way it is, ma- «
jors rieed: new and innovative ways to use their ©

training,” Miller said.
She says she can foresee university students

helping with and eventually taking over some of

her classes, allowing her to oversee the project
as a whole. She would like to set up a teacher
training program, possibly attending a training
session next summer to prepare herself. Miller
also envisions a summer institute to train Suzuki
teachers that would attract more people to the
campus and introduce them to the music depart-
ment.

“The method is really popular in many
places,” she said, ‘“‘and is readily catching on in
this area, looking at the increase in students over
the past years that have heard strictly through
word of mouth. I do no advertising.”

Teaching string classes in the public schools,
she spent much of the lesson time undoing
mistakes the children practiced during the week.
By including the family in the lessons many of
those errors do not occur.

The structure of the program requires that
mothers attend each session with their children,
so that when practicing is done at home they can
repeat the instructions of the teacher. Because
the children first learn by hearing the pieces
played correctly on a record and not by reading
music, family time must be spent listening to
these recordings.

The family participation provides an environ-
ment for the children that not only fosters
musical skill but also social skill that molds the
character of the youngsters. Their parents claim
to have few disciplinary problems and assert
that the children are better prepared to follow
directions, be neat and do their schoolwork.

The founder of the Suzuki method describes its
purpose as “not to turn out prodigies or virtuosi,
though some do become that, but just to turn out
noble kind of people who have an appreciation
of the arts through music.”

Brunch at the Trencherman
always a valiant experience

By DAVID HAWKINGS

The tradition of going out for
Sunday brunch has grown fast
and strong in New York,
Philadelphia, Washington D.C.
and Lewisburg.

While the herd of students here
continues to assemble for the
crowded ritual of mass-produced
Eggs Benedict in Roy Grier, a
small but persistent group ven-
tures outside the University.
Most go to places like Perkin’s
Pancake House on Route 15, but
the far better bet - and better buy
- seems consistently to be The
Valiant Trencherman on North
2nd Street.

The point of eating out of ‘“‘the

caf’’ seems to be simply to get off
campus for an hour or two, to
remove oneself from _ the
pressures of collegiate time and
place and to enjoy the food while
away.
On Sunday, there is no public
place in town more relaxed than
the Trencherman. Ironically and
unfortunately, this quality of at-
mosphere also introduces a Bohe-
mian quality of almost com-
pulsive laxity to the brunch that
often obscures both the quality of
the food and the very reason for
getting away.

During the week, the two 32-
year-old owners, David Graham
and Jan Muzyczka, offer a menu
of fish, chicken, quiche and
vegetarian dishes at both lunch
and dinner that are generally
well prepared and well served
while offering a refreshingly uni-
que culinary option to this part of
the world.

The list of brunchtime edibles
is also as non-traditional as can
be imagined; it is hard to offer a
brunch buffet without eggs or
pancakes, but at the Trencner-
man they offer neither, and
neither is missed. What is missed
is the sense that the owners have
been offering brunch each Sun-
day since their restaurant opened
in September 1978.

Tasty as most of the food is, the
preparation and presentation is
never more than casual, and is
often closer to sloppy. The small
room wherein the spread is layed
out looks like brunch is just end-
ing no matter how early in the

day you arrive. (Serving hours
Sundays are 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.)
Coffee is usually spilled and not
cleaned up, bagel and doughnut
crumbs are everywhere and
spoons and knives covered with
cream cheese and fruit butter lie
haphazardly in and around
various bowls and plates. Despite
the appearance of the Valiant
Trencherman as a kitchen used
by a family of 14, the quality of
the food is generally fine and
echos in its freshness and variety
the amiable qualities of the week-
day restaurant.

There are three price items for
brunch at the Trencherman. For
$2 — which the management calls
‘‘Humble”’ — patrons may choose
from a dozen different kinds of
bagels served with the aforemen-
tioned fruit butters and creamed
cheese, a variety of doughnuts
from Keeley’s Bakery in Lewis-
burg, a selection of flavored cof-
fees and teas and three different
fruit juices.

At this level of the three-tiered
brunch structure the spread is at
its least unique and enjoyable.
While the fruit butters — apricot,
raspberry and apple are the
regulars — the coffees and the
teas offer flavors not found often
on the local pallet, the bagels im-
ported from Baltimore definitely
taste as if they have been travel-
ing a while, though toasting cures
this ailment, and the juice is con-
sistently watery.

As with most restaurants,

things get better the more you
pay. ‘‘Modest”’ brunchers sample
from the $2 table plus a selection
of Farmers Market-bought
cheeses and vegetables, home-
made sticky buns and — the
meal’s highlight — an excep-
tionally fresh and well-blended
fruit salad. All this for $3 is a
bargain...

...but, if you’re willing to spend
an extra dollar, the Trencher-
man’s list of offerings really
takes off. After taking from the
“Humble’”’ and ‘‘Modest”’ tables,
“Valiant” customers arrive at a
table laden with a crock of onion
soup, fresh smoked salmon,
creamed herring, two types of
homemade quiche and a home-
made cassata (a Spanish pastry
made with cottage cheese and
orange rind).

This is the table to linger at on
Sundays in Lewisburg. While the
quiche tends toward greasiness,
it is tasty, and both the herring
and the salmon will cure any case
of the munchies when piled on a
bagel — no matter how rubbery.

Graham and Muzyczka could
not be more friendly and — by
their count — brunch could hard-
ly be more popular. Bagels are
consumed at the rate of 55 dozen
each Sunday, and people stay
well into the afternoon reading
the Sunday papers spread around
the two dining rooms. All
Bucknellians should linger there
at least once.

9 oO
Women s soccer club Co-coach Louise Ferretti °82

drops two matches

The women’s soccer club drop-
ped a pair of close games this
weekend in New Brunswick, N.J.,
losing 4-2 at Princeton and 2-1 in
overtime at Rutgers.

The Bisons fell behind
Princeton 2-0 in the first half on
Friday. They allowed a third
Tiger goal early in the second
half, before making a comeback.
Bucknell twice tallied on
scrambles in front of the
Princeton net following corner
kicks by JoAnne Horvath ’83, ac-
cording to senior Mary Child,
who served with Beth Conboy ’81
as player-coach for the trip. The
Tigers then registered a fourth
goal to send the Bisons to their
fourth straight defeat.

Against Rutgers on Saturday,
Bucknell played ‘“‘by far the best
game we've played this year,”
according to Child.

The game was lost on a Scarlet
Knight penalty shot with only one
minute remaining in the over-
time session. Carol Duncan ’82
scored the lone Bison marker on
a penalty kick.

Coach Pete Puccia ’81 stated,
“The team is starting to solidify
going into the meat of the
season.”

UltimateW omen win

$ debut at Lock Haven

The women’s ultimate frisbee
club defeated Lock Haven, 12-10,
on Saturday to successfully open
their fall campaign.

The Bucknell Ultimate Women
trailed 8-4 at halftime because we
“choked when we got near their
goal line,” according to Sheila

said she delivered an “‘inspira-
tional pep talk” during intermis-
sion and then ‘we got our
adrenalin going.’ The Ultimate
Women surrendered two more
goals at the start of the second
half but then scored eight
straight themselves to pull out
the victory.

Ferretti praised the play of
Becky Burns ’81 as ‘‘controller”’
and Christie Wholey ’83, who
“made outstanding plays
throughout the game.”

The next contest for the
Ultimate Women will be Oct. 25
when they host Lock Haven,
University of Virginia and
Glassboro State.

Bayo, ‘‘were impatient and con-
stantly throwing passes away.”
The game was knotted at 19
before Bucknell rallied to score
the final two goals to up their
record to 3-4.

Bayo praised the play of Chris
Liska ’84, Geoff Gigon ’82 and Fid
Speer ’80.

The Mudsharks host Penn
State, University of Virginia,
Hershey Frisbee Club and
Washington, D.C. Frisbee Club in
a round robin tournament on the
Bucknell West fields Saturday.

In a weekend of mixed success,
the men’s ultimate frisbee club
was outclassed by Glassboro
State, 25-7, but edged the Trenton
Disc Devils, 21-19 in Mercerville,
N.J.

Against Glassboro State, the
defending national champions,
the Mudsharks quickly fell
behind and trailed 15-2 by the end
of the first half. According to
team member Mel Bayo ’81, the
Mudsharks were “pretty in-
timidated because ‘Boro is so
good’.”” The ’Sharks improved
somewhat in the second half, be-
ing outscored only 10-5. Bayo
commented, ‘‘The rookies played
well’ in the losing cause.

In the second game, Trenton,
21-9 losers to Bucknell two weeks
ago, gave the Mudsharks pro-
blems before succumbing 21-19.
The ’Sharks were “clearly the
better team,” but, according to

heavyweight boxing title Thurs-
day night in Las Vegas, losing to
Larry Holmes on a technical
knockout after ten rounds.

Angelo Dundee, Ali’s trainer,
stopped the scheduled 15-round
fight after witnessing the self-
proclaimed ‘greatest’ being
punished while losing all ten
rounds.

From the start, Holmes was the
aggressor, landing hooks and
jabs as Ali constantly covered up
while throwing few punches. Ali
finally started to punch in the
sixth but Holmes continued to ap-
ply pressure and won the round in
a flurry of blows.

Holmes weakened Ali with
several hard shots in the ninth
and continued to assault his now
defenseless opponent in the tenth.
Ali’s eyes were puffed con-
siderably as Holmes landed pun-
ches at will when Dundee stopped
the contest.

Polo battles powerful UCLA

From POLO, page 20

The Bruins slowly wore down
the Bisons in the third quarter
with a counter-attacking offense.
In addition, Schulte remarked,
“They used more of their bench
than we did because they have
more depth.’’ The fast pace took
its toll, and UCLA outscored
Bucknell 2-1 in each of the last
two quarters to emerge vic-
torious.

Nevertheless, the game was
viewed as a moral victory by the

Bison players. Weiman com-
mented, ‘To play this well early
in the season does a great deal for
our confidence,” while Schulte
added, ‘‘We were in the game the
whole time.”

Paxton finished with 12 saves,
while Weiman and Gensheimer
had two goals apiece. Schulte and
Butler added solo goals.

Schulte, who has scored 401
goals in the last three seasons,
was held to a mere three shots by
UCLA. He commented, “They

The Bisons completed the tour-

The varsity field hockey team
captured its first match of the

Betsy Doyle ’82 made nine
saves and “probably played the
best game she’s had,” according
to Starr. Red Raider goaltender
Jenny Bueton registered seven
saves.

completed a sweep of the Red
Raiders by winning 1-0 on
freshman Linda Ferguson’s se-
cond half goal. The Bucknell J.V.
now sports a 1-2-1 ledger.

The loss to Ithaca, now 3-0, was
actually ‘‘a better played game
by us’ than the Colgate match,
remarked Starr. The Bombers’
Margaret Pilling scored the
game’s only goal in the second
half on a shot ‘‘Doyle could have
saved,” according to Starr. Doyle
made 14 saves as the Bisons were
outshot 22-11. Paula Majeski of
Ithaca had only to save two shots.
The Bombers also took 22 corners
to seven for Bucknell.

Thursday, the Bisons hosted
Susquehanna, a team Bucknell
defeated 2-0 last season. The divi-
sion III Crusaders have nine
starters returning.

Saturday, the field hockey
team travels to Philadelphia to
face LaSalle, the division II
regional champions last year.
Starr expects ‘‘a very close
game,’”’ as the Explorers are

team’s first victory of the season Monday. Betsy Doyle ‘82 “just as good as Ithaca and Col-

made nine saves to shut out the Red Raiders, 1-0.

Herd plays explosive Davidson [ gycxyett

has been intercepted only twice.

By ARTHUR BROCKWAY
The Herd will battle Davidson Saturday at
Richardson Field in Davidson, N.C. The Wildcats’
2-1 record includes a 56-3 rout of Southwestern last
Saturday, a 27-20 loss at Lafayette on Sept. 20 anda
season opening victory over Springfield.

The Bisons have won their previous four
meetings. Last fall, the Herd scored a 33-0 victory at
Memorial Stadium as Ken Jenkins ’82, Paul D’Alioa
80 and Hassen Abdellah 80: all rushed for over 100
yards.

Davidson has a potent offense that leads the
NCAA Division I-AA in scoring (39.8 points per
game), rushing (306 yards per game) and total of-
fense (505 yards per game).

Junior fullback Ray Sinclair is the national leader
in rushing, with 477 yards in three games, and scor-
ing, with seven touchdowns. Junior quarterback
Brian Whitmore is first nationally in passing effi-
ciency (62 percent) and fourth in total offense with
598 yards. He has thrown six touchdown passes and

gate.”

Other offensive threats are halfback Mickey
Dillon, who scored three touchdowns against
Southwestern, and speedy tight end James Jones,
who has caught 11 passes for 235 yards thus far.

The Wildcats play a 5-2 defensive alignment that
is “sound, with no major strengths,” according to
Bison quarterback Al Locey ’83. The one standout is
250 lb. noseguard Sven Pederson.

The Bisons expect ‘‘some stacks and stunting, but
not too much blitzing,’’ remarked Locey. The
Wildcats rotate defensive backs, so Locey hopes to
“beat them deep when we catch the weak man in
their rotation.”

Davidson’s defense is “‘little, fast and likes to
gang tackle”’ according to tri-captain Dave Hibbard
81. The Wildcats will attempt to intimidate the
Herd, but Locey is confident of a third straight vic-
tory, stating, ‘‘We finally found out we can do it
(last Saturday against Brown),”’ so “‘things should
go well if we can keep our cool.”

All-Blacks lose, 6-3

By JEFF McCONNELL
The Carlisle Old Gaelics spoiled the fall debut of Bucknell’s rugby
club as they edged the All-Blacks, 6-3, on Saturday. The All-Blacks,
Eastern Pennsylvania Rugby Union division B champions a year ago,
were outscored but not outplayed by the experienced Old Gaelics, who
were making their fourth outing of the year.

The All-Blacks’ strong defensive performance in the scoreless
first half proved to their arch rivals that they are a team to be reckon-
ed with. Many times, Carlisle pushed inside Bucknell’s 25-yard line,
only to have their scoring threats nullified. The All-Blacks regained
field position by taking several important five-yard scrums.

Bucknell’s first scoring chance came early in the second half when

senior Steve Dixon’s surprise drop kick from 25 yards failed to clear
the uprights.

The Gaelics came right back and scored the only try of the game
ona breakaway to take the lead, 4-0. The conversion was successful,
putting Carlisle in front by 6-0.

The All-Blacks rallied and pushed deep into Gaelic territory. Dix-

on scored Bucknell’s first points of the season by capitalizing on a
penalty kick to close the gap to 6-3.

However, time expired before the All-Blacks mounted another
threat, and Carlisle was victorious.

Good teamwork and several outstanding individual performances
contributed to the quality of the All-Blacks’ play. Scrum half Bob
Rockwell ’83 and John Lester ’81 at second row performed well in their
first-ever rugby test. Veterans Bill Charlton ’81, Don DeAngelo ’81 and
Mike Yorio ’83 also turned in stalwart performances.

“It wasn’t pretty, but it’s a win,” were Coach
Craig Reynolds’ words to the soccer team following
Tuesday night’s 3-1 victory over Susquehanna. The
contest enabled the Bisons to boost their record to

3-1.

The teams ended what Reynolds termed a
“scary” first half deadlocked at one goal apiece.
The Bisons played well in the opening period, con-
trolling the tempo of the game, but failed to connect
on their many scoring opportunities.

Meanwhile, the defense was keeping the
Crusaders handcuffed by allowing them only one
real scoring threat, but Susquehanna was able to
make that chance count, putting a header past
goalie Pete Puccia ’81 for a 1-0 lead.

The advantage was short-lived, however, as the
booters’ persistence paid off with a goal from
sophomore Steve Goldenring. ‘‘It was important for
us to score before the half,” noted Reynolds, adding
that “‘it prevented them from coming out and sitting
on the lead.”

The second half was characterized by sloppy play
on the part of the Bisons, who rallied long enough to
put two more goals on the board.

The game-winner came on a header by midfielder
Mark Brotherton ’83 after an indirect kick had been
awarded. From about 40 yards out, Fritz Shaak ’81
chipped the ball high toward the goal where
Brotherton directed it past the Crusader netminder.

An insurance goal followed minutes later when
Pat Christ ’82 took a pass from senior Tom Rotelli,
beat the Susquehanna defender for a breakaway
and deposited the ball in the Crusader goal.

Although he was happy with the victory, Reynolds
was concerned with his team’s play. ‘‘We could’ve
had more than three goals—we missed six good
scoring opportunities. Someone’s going to start ask- -
ing why we aren’t putting the ball in the net when we
have the chance. We might be pressing too much.”

The win had followed a 1-1 tie at West Chester last
Saturday. The scenario in the first half there was
much the same as in Tuesday’s game.

The booters dominated the opening period,
receiving little pressure from the Rams. Bucknell
opened the scoring at about the 20 minute mark
when Brotherton drilled a low shot toward the op-
posite post to beat the Ram goaltender.

The second half proved different as West Chester
came out fighting. “They were pumped and we
were flat—we were outplayed,” commented
Reynolds.

“TI don’t like to make excuses,”’ said Reynolds,
‘but the officials broke up the tempo of the game.
They gave West Chester every opportunity.”
Reynolds also noted that the game became very
physical due to the interruptions and that “things
got out of control.”

The Rams then benefitted from a bizarre series of
events that resulted in the tying goal. The show
began with an obstruction call against Rotelli, giv-
ing a free kick to West Chester. Then, in what
Reynolds described as ‘‘the worst thing I’ve ever
seen as coach,”’ the official “misplaced the ball by
25 feet.””

The ensuing play saw the Ram’s shot ruffle the
net behind Puccia.

“It would’have been very difficult to score if the
ball had been placed correctly,” stated Reynolds,
contending that the goal had resulted from the im-
proved angle afforded the Rams by the official’s in-
correct placement.

Reynolds cited lack of offensive production as
contributing to Bucknell’s problems: ‘You can’t
win a lot of games on one goal.”

The booters square off against Rutgers at home
Saturday at 1:00 p.m. and then travel to Penn State
Tuesday.

“Rutgers is a real tough team,” remarked
Reynolds. ‘‘We’ll need one of our best games of the
year to win. My biggest concern is getting our
strongest unit healthy and ready to play.”

The Bisons were bothered by injuries in their last
two games, with several starters playing at less
than 100 percent. Shaak, Rotelli and juniors John
Krupka and Bob Brown are hampered by ‘“‘muscle
pulls, sore feet, hyperextensions—nothing serious,”
according to Reynolds.

Reynolds also intends to work on offense by in-
corporating more game simulation into practices,
noting that ‘‘We must increase our scoring percen-
tage. We move the ball well but we have to take it
one step further.”’

“We'll have to play better against Rutgers than
we have in our last two games,” he concluded.

Troubles continue for Spikers

By JEANNE MINAHAN

Sent home in defeat this week
by both Mansfield State and
Catholic University, the women’s
volleyball team watched their
record sink to 1-6. A home ad-
vantage proved less dismal for
the Bisons, however, as they
stunned Susquehanna for their
first victory, sweeping the
Crusaders in three sets.

On Wednesday, the spikers
gave talented Mansfield a battle
before losing, 4-15, 15-6, 1-15, 11-
15. Mansfield was ‘very strong,
since they’ve had the same group
of competitors for three years
now,” said Coach Terrie Grieb.
The Bisons’ serving improved,
but their execution wasn’t good,
according to Grieb.

The Bisons captured their first
win of the season by dominating
Susquehanna University 3-0 on
Monday in Davis Gym. The
Bisons have now defeated the
Crusaders for three consecutive
years.

In the first game of the match,
anxiety arose when Susquehanna

However, the squad came back
with a sustained effort, scoring
the next 15 points to win the first
game, 15-4. They followed with
15-2 and 15-6 scores to take the
match.

Freshman Kathy Eckert
“overwhelmed them with her
blocks, spikes and serve,” ac-
cording to Grieb. Grieb also
praised the excellent play of Ann
Novasatka °83, senior captain
Susan Bairstow. Jeanne
Groeneveld ’83 was also com-
mended for her many spikes and
dinks.

OF LEWISBURG

By BRIAN FETTERHOFF
The women’s tennis team concluded a grueling
three day series of matches on Tuesday by
defeating Franklin and Marshall to raise their
record to 2-1. The squad opened the season on Sun-
day with a victory over Catholic University but lost
to Colgate on Monday.

Against F&M, the Bisons won four of six singles
matches and swept the three doubles contests to
earn a 7-2 victory.

Patty Koch ’83 began the rout with a 6-0, 6-2
triumph over Mary Haverstock in first singles.
Sarah Kreiger ’83 toppled Susan Ridge in second
singles, 6-1, 6-2, while co-captain Kirsten Schubauer
’81 captured the third point by downing Sue Tolve,
7-5, 6-4. Barbara Kiel then won the first Diplomat
point by conquering Cindy Appel ’83, 6-2, 6-3.

On the remaining singles matches, co-captain
Janis Huber ’81 captured the fifth position by win-
ning a close match, 6-7, 6-4, 7-6, while Laura Kirch-
stein ’84 was defeated in the final spot, 4-6, 3-4.

In doubles matches, Krieger and Ann Wilbur ’84

was particularly encouraging
because the team had just return-
ed from Washington, D.C. where
they lost to a tough Catholic
University squad on Sunday.

With a 12-6 lead in the first
game, the Bisons missed seven
chances to win, and they lost 22-
20, 15-2 and 15-8.

Although Novasatka and senior
Nina Kaminsky performed well,
Grieb attributed the loss to “a
lack of hustle and poor serve
reception.” Bucknell will have
another shot at the Cardinals
when they travel to the LaSalle
Tournament Oct. 31 in
Philadelphia.

Herd upsets Brown as Jenkins stars

a

The defense continued to thwart Brown’s
offensive efforts, as linebacker Pat Paro
’81 jumped on a Carbone fumble to turn the
ball back over to the offense.

The Herd drove to the Bruin 20, where a
holding penalty set them back to the 34-
yard line. The drive looked to have stalled
as Bucknell faced a third-and-26 situation,
but Jenkins came through again. Al Locey
83 dropped back as Jenkins cut across the

Ken Jenkins ‘82 recorded his sixth career 100-yard game Saturday against
Brown to become the 12th leading all-time Bison rusher with 1,170 yards.

By STEVEN SKOLNICK and
MICHAEL SUAREZ

Led by an outstanding performance by
Ken Jenkins ’82, who rushed 27 times for
192 yards and scored two touchdowns, the
Bisons whipped Brown University, 28-20
last Saturday in Providence, R.I. Jenkins’
efforts earned him ECAC Division I-AA Of-
fensive Player of the Week honors.

Head Coach Bob Curtis called the win ‘“‘a

Meanwhile, Brown scored on an 80-yard
march when fullback Steve Curtin drove
two yards over right guard to hit the end
zone and put Brown on top, 7-0.

The Herd offense was frustrated and
when the defensive crew took the field they
had no intention of staying there long. One
play later the offense was back in charge
as defensive back Doug Smoot ’82 in-
tercepted a Larry Carbone pass on the

Four plays later Jenkins headed for an open spot near
the sideline. As a Brown defender lunged at him, Jenkins
sprinted 47 yards into the endzone, leaving a trail of Bruin

defenders inhis wake.

great team victory,” as the entire
Bucknell squad gave an inspired per-
formance to topple the favored Bruins.

From every indication in the first
quarter, it looked to be a long afternoon for
Bucknell. The Bisons had recovered a
Brown fumble on the opening kickoff but
couldn’t put any points on the board as
sophomore Bill Grennon’s 28-yard field
goal missed the mark.

On the next series, Bucknell pieced
together a sustained 11-play march that
brought them into Brown territory, but
again the drive sputtered.

to the wire before iosing.

Bison 33-yard line.

This time the Bison offense went to work
behind the powerful backfield duo of
Jenkins and Marshall Hall ’83. The tandem
ran the Herd down to the Brown 3 where
they faced a fourth-and-two situation. The
call went to right halfback Hall, who
crashed his way over left guard to the one-
yard line.

Bucknell had a first down and four plays
to hit pay dirt. They only needed one at-

and raced 36 yards for the score. The point
after put Bucknell ahead, 14-7.

But the Bruins had no intentions of quit-
ting, and when Brown’s Tim Rualk return-
ed junior Ken Durr’s punt after the next
series 81 yards for a Brown score, the
game was even once again.

On Bucknell’s next possession, Locey
was intercepted and the ball was returned
to the Bison 35. The Bruins offense looked
to be on the move again.

However, the Herd defense refused to
bow, and the Bruins lost seven yards on
their next possession, mainly due to a sack
by Dave Hibbard ’81.

Forty-two yards and 49 seconds later the
Herd tallied their third touchdown of the
half on junior Rich Passerotti’s spec-
tacular reception of a Locey aerial.

Brown could do nothing in the remaining

eight seconds and the Herd went into the
locker room confident and ahead.

The third quarter was a classic defen-
sive battle as the Herd held Brown to just
23 yards. Early in the fourth quarter, the
Bisons missed a scoring opportunity, when
Grennon’s 41-yard field goal attempt was
wide.

The Bisons allowed the Bruins only one
first down before forcing yet another punt.
Four plays later Jenkins headed for an
open spot near the sideline. Just before he
reached the hole, however, three pursuing
Bruin defenders filled the gap. As one
lunged at him, Jenkins backed up and
reversed his field, leaving a trail of Bruin
defenders in his wake. He sprinted 47
yards to the left corner of the end zone.
Grennon’s kick made the score Bucknell
28, Brown 14.

The Bruins scored with 13 seconds left in
the contest to close the gap to 28-20, but
time expired and a jubilant Curtis was car-
ried off the field on the shoulders of his
players.

Polo impressive at
Brown Tournament

By DAVE KIRKPATRICK

PROVIDENCE, R.I. — The
men’s water polo team “probably
played the best we’ve ever played
as a unit,” according to captain
Scott Schulte ’81, in winning two
of three games at the Brown
Tournament last weekend. The
Bisons edged. Brown, 6-5, then
lost to powerful UCLA, 8-6, before
trouncing MIT, 18-5.

The season opener against
Brown on Friday night marked
the Bisons’ first appearance in a
longer 30-meter pool. Despite the
unfamiliar pool and playing in
front of a large Brown audience,
the Bisons charged to a 5-1 lead
after three quarters. However,
Brown stormed back with four
goals in the final quarter to tie the
score.

The Bisons regained their com-
posure at this point, and Tom
Butler ’82 scored his second goal
of the game to send the Brown
fans home disappointed. Scoring
once apiece were Schulte, seniors
Mark Gensheimer and Marc Corl

and junior Dave Inglefield.
Goalie Tony Paxton was outstan-
ding while making 10 saves.

The Bisons’ next challenge was
mighty UCLA on Saturday morn-
ing. The Bruins defeated
Bucknell, 17-7, in last year’s
NCAA championships on their
way to asecond place finish.

Surprisingly, it was the Bisons
who took charge early in the
match, and Peter Weiman, ’81,
gave Bucknell a 1-0 lead midway
through the quarter. Paxton was
sparkling in the nets, and with the
help of three UCLA shots that hit
the post, the Bisons fought and
scrapped to hold the lead to the
end of the quarter.

In the second quarter, UCLA
started to establish itself more on
offense and the result was four
Bruin goals. Bucknell kept pace,
however, by scoring three goals
to end the half at 4-4. Schulte
commented, ‘‘We took advantage
of six on five situations well.”’

Southside Johnny performs Saturday in Davis Gymnasium.
The Bucknell Concert Committee sponsored his appearance
and considers the concert a success. Attended by record
number of Bucknell students, it reversed a trend for
concerts here that were attended by mostly non-Bucknell
students.

Record crowd attends a
‘successful’ concert here

By KEN QUAAS

An estimated 1,900 Bucknell students in attendance at the
Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes concert Saturday night in
Davis Gymnasium was “easily a record,” according to Rich
Schaberg ’81, assistant chairman of the Bucknell Concert Commit-
tee.

“Tt was the most successful show we’ve ever had in the sense of
drawing Bucknellians together,” he said.

The concert committee ‘‘will be within $500 of breaking even”’ ac-
cording to Chris Petermann ’81, chairman of the organization. The
committee has ‘‘no current plans for future concerts because right
now the market is incredibly dry,”” Petermann said.

He added that there are fewer bands touring at this time than
before because of the energy crisis, and particularly, the high cost
of fuel. The committee also has what he called “considerable range
limitations.” These “limitations” include the small capacity poten-
tial—3,200—of Davis Gym and committee finances.

“we were lucky to get Southside,” Petermann said. “He was
very inexpensive (a $7,500 talent fee for the band plus a $2,500 sum
for the crew) and he’s currently touring colleges in this area
because that’s where he thinks his fans are.”

Touring small colleges is a ‘“‘thing of the past’’ for most bands, ac-
cording to Schaberg. He said bands lose money playing to smaller
crowds because of ‘modern exorbitant expenses.”

Student group struggles
to recover use of funds

By KEN WOLCKENHAUER

A controversy over the ap-
propriation of more than $4,000
has the members of the Recyc-
ling Club engaged in a struggle
with its former advisor,
Mechanical Engineering Pro-
fessor Charles Coder.

The money, earned by the club
for between 1972 and 1979, has
been locked in a savings account
by Coder, the club’s trustee.

Coder said the money, amoun-
ting to $4,633, will be saved and
used as a scholarship fund which,
he said, was the original intent of
the recycling effort.

The account is under his and
University Treasurer Robert
Shimer’s names.

According to Dean of Student
Affairs John Dunlop, ‘‘Our policy
has been to respect the goals
determined by the original
members of a group such as the
Recycling Club. We are relying
on Professor Coder’s word on
those goals since he was one of
the founders.”

Dunlop said the University
tries to protect the interests of
groups that are formed with
specific goals. Unless the univer-

sity finds strong evidence con-
trary, they would honor those
goals, he said.

Dunlop said if the Recycling
Club wishes, it can have the ABS
petition for a review of policy.
The review, he said, would be
given to determine what the
club’s funds were and whether
the present members are entitled
to control it.

“We would rather not engage in
areview,”’ Dunlop said, however.
“We're not sure what kind of an
effect that will have on other
clubs.”

Recycling Club President Bob
Doms ’81 said it was Coder’s idea
and never the official intent of the
club’s members to provide a
scholarship fund. He said the
money belongs to the club and its
use should be at the club’s discre-
tion.

Doms said the group would use
the funds from the account for
which Coder is a trustee to pursue
the club’s present goals, in-
cluding the renovation or pur-
chase of a paper baling machine.

Baling recycled paper enables
it to be resold at a much higher
price than paper not machine-

CHARLES CODER

baled, Doms said.

In 1979, Coder resigned from
his advisory post to the club.
Coder said he left not because of
any hardships but because of
pressures elsewhere in the
mechanical engineering depart-
ment.

Pew Trust donates $250,000 for computer center

By DAVID HAWKINGS

The Pew Memorial Trust has donated
$250,000 to the campaign for improved
computer facilities here, putting the drive
for the $2.8 million it will take to complete
the project past the halfway point.

University President Dennis O’Brien an-
nounced the gift — received as a cashier’s
check in a letter Sept. 22 — at the monthly
faculty meeting Monday.

The donation is the largest in the cam-
paign since the Fairchild Foundation gave
the $1 million in May 1979 that started the
computer improvement plans.

The University has now collected or had
pledged to it $1.7 million, according to
Jerome Rackoff, the University’s

specialist in soliciting funds from founda-
tions and the federal government. Besides
the Fairchild Foundation, other major
supporters of the project have been the
Merrill Trust, Western Electric Co. and
the Booth Ferris Foundation.

O’Brien said he hopes to finish the cam-
paign by the end of the academic year.

He and Vice President for University
Relations John Ferguson met with Pew
Trust President Robert Smith as part of
the application for the gift.

The University did not ask the Pew Trust
—founded by former Sun Oil Co. executive
J. Howard Pew — for any specific amount
of money, Rackoff said. They did not know
the amount of the gift until the cashier’s

check arrived in O’Brien’s mail three
weeks ago, he said.

“The Pew Trust has been a steady and
firm supporter of the University,” O’Brien
said, citing recent gifts of $200,000 to the
Sports/Recreation Center campaign anda
donation of $100,000 for an electron
microscope.

The trust is the second largest philan-
thropic organization in the country in
terms of amount donated annually.

The gift may be used to finance any of
the three projects underway involving the
computer center: the construction of the
new building adjacent to the Dana
Engineering Building, the purchase of new
computer hardware system or the

transferral of all information from the pre-
sent computer to the machine that is to be
purchased.

“A few more gifts like this and we will be
all set,” O’Brien told the faculty.

The announcement of the gift was the
highlight of an otherwise uneventful 45-
minute faculty meeting.

After hearing reports from the five stan-
ding faculty committees, however, the 75
faculty members present heard a presen-
tation from Commputer Center Director
Jon Eschinger, who said there are ‘‘more
than 7200 faculty programs in our system,
and we don’t know why many of them are
there or what they are.”

Library’s growing pains cause

stacks to fill student lounge

By TRICIA KENNEDY

The second floor student lounge of the Ellen Clark
Bertrand Library has been replaced with book
stacks, because of the library’s lack of ‘‘adequate
floor space,’ according to University Librarian
George Jenks.

The lounge was one of the few rooms in the library
where smoking, eating, and drinking were not pro-
hibited.

Vending machines for snacks and hot beverages
were located adjacent to the room, but since con-
sumption of food was permitted only in the lounge,
the machines were removed Wednesday.

Jenks said the Kress Gallery — adjacent to the
former lounge — may also be converted to a storage
area for the overflow of books and reference
materials unless another location for the material is
found.

The conversion of the rooms stems from the
library’s “‘need of expansion,” Jenks said. The pre-
sent library facility is ‘“‘not suitable today in terms
of space needs,” he added.

The Library Facilities Planning Committee,
formed in 1978, has been working on plans to expand
the library. The function of the committee—which is
chaired by Vice President for Administration and
Finance John Zeller—is to take suggestions concer-
ning the library from the campus community and to
make recommendations to the University, ac-
cording to Jenks.

A report presented at a committee meeting in

Photo—Eileen Jager
ANTI-NUKE RALLY—L.A. Williams of Wilkes-Barre, a mem-
ber of the Eco-Coalition group there, entertains demonstra-

March 1979 said the library contained 66,100 square
feet of floor space. Projections at that time in-
dicated that another 83,200 square feet—more than
double the floor space available now—will have to
be added in order to meet the library’s needs by
1984.

The additional space would allow for growth in
bookshelf space, seating and study areas, and office
space, according to the report.

New facilities suggested in the report included
storage lockers, a computer terminal, a theses
area, and a “late study room’’ which would be kept
open after the library’s normal closing time.

No actual plans for such expansion have yet been
drawn up, Jenks said, adding that the construction
of the new computer center here will put off any ac-
tion regarding the library for at least one year.

No meetings have been scheduled for the library
planning committee yet this year, Jenks said.

Members of the committee include Professor of
Spanish Mills Edgerton; Associate Professor of
Biology, Richard Ellis; Professor of Sociology,
John Kendrick, and Professor of History, Mark
Neuman. ~

Also on the committee are Physical Plant Direc-
tor John Bell, Director of Media Services Robert
Dunkerly, Assistant Director of the Computer
Center John Eschinger, and Assistant Librarian
Nancy Weyant.

Amy Jordan ’81, Allen Haines ’81 and Jenks are
also on the committee.

Bookshelves now fill the room that served as the student
lounge until last semester. A lack of adequate floor space
prompted the move, according to library officials.

Food co-op started by students

By CATHY NAGEL

Students for a Cooperative
Future — a student food
cooperative that hopes to offer a
viable alternative to eating in the
University’s cafeteria — has
been soliciting new members this
week in the University Center
Mall.

The group was formed last
spring under direction of Gene
Spagnoli ’80 as a way for students
to obtain nutritional foods
through means other than the
cafeteria plan.

The program is offered again
this year by a new coordinator,
Lynn Jenkins ’82. Karen
Michelsen ’82, Betsy Shrier ’81
and ABS President John
Dzurinko ’81 are serving as co-
coordinators.

The table in the mall has at-
tracted 37 people to sign up for
participation in the cooperative,
according to Shrier. Since most of
these people will be buying food
for an entire apartment, the total
number of students she said will
be using the system this year will
be between 50 and 60. ,

Each week, participants in the
co-op will be given a form listing
non-perishable food items, from
which orders may be placed.

The order forms will then be
tallied and a collective order will
be made to local participating
stores. Six area food stores have
agreed to let the co-op purchase

large quantities of goods at dis-
counted prices of ten to forty per-
cent.

When the order is returned, all
members are expected to
separate and distribute the
ordered items. Members are also
responsible for the bookkeeping
of the program. Each partici-
pant’s responsibilities change on
a weekly basis.

~

The group will be using the

Taylor Street House basement
temporarily as a distribution
headquarters for the co-op.
Jenkins said if a room with kit-
chen facilities can be leased the
group will be able to do its own
baking.

Although the food co-op might
draw students away from the
University Dining Service, Direc-
tor Henry (Hank) Ross has told
the coordinators the group might
be allowed to buy some food
items through the cafeteria.

Members will be expected to
help pay the operating costs.
There will be either an initial fee
of about $19, or a slight food tax of
1 or 2 percent on the items,
Jenkins said.

Food selection during the first
few weeks will include natural
foods, such as grains, flours,
cereals, canned goods, dried
fruits, bean and alfalfa sprouts,
breads, and cheeses. Jenkins ex-
pressed hope that the food selec-

LYNN JENKINS

tion will eventually include meat,
fresh fruits and fresh vegetables.

Those who participated in the
cooperative last year estimated
that buying food as part of the co-
op cost $5 to $10 less per week
than buying a meal ticket, ac-
cording to Jenkins.

The group hopes that if the
cooperative is successful this
year, it will be able to join with
the Lewisburg Food Cooperative.
A union of the groups would help
in strengthening ties between the
community and the University,
Jenkins said.

Student Life committee seeks ideas

tors during Saturday's anti-nuclear rally in Berwick. A
nuclear-generated power plant is under construction in
Berwick, and is now 75 percent complete. A drive was
held here last week to gain support for the rally from
students. According to an organizer, only ten students from
Bucknell attended the demonstration, but the size of the
crowd in Berwick was estimated to have been 200-250
persons. The rally was held on the property of the plant,

with the permission of Pennsylvania Power and Light Co.

The Student Life Committee, a recently revived
branch of the ABS, is now exploring avenues for the
diversification of social life on campus.

The committee is concerned with ‘‘any aspects of
Bucknell life that are not academic or financial,”
according to Chairman Janice Meuller ’83.

She said the committee depends upon continuous
feedback from the students ‘“‘to decide which issues
and problems are in need of attention.”

Recent suggestions, according to Meuller, have
indicated a concern about a lack of ‘‘social diversi-

ty” here. Alternatives to the fraternity social life
have been explored, and some—like Christy’s
Gate—have been successful, she said.

Ten students serve on the committee in addition
to Meuller. The committee is planning orientation
programs for transfer students, and will provide
assistance to the University Counseling Service in
the administering of a psychological survey for
students next semester.

Meuller said the committee has ‘‘absolute
dependence’”’ on student feedback for it to be mean-
ingful.

Recycling fund contested| Fraternity bomb scare closes
street and forces evacuation

From RECYCLING, page 1

The funds in the club’s treasury
have remained under his control,
however.

“Tt’s a matter of principle. I
wouldn’t want us to go back on
our word. I support the scholar-
* ship alternative. We will be doing
something good for the communi-
ty as well as supporting the
recycling effort,”’ Coder said.

Although the club opened a new
account under its new advisor,
assistant professor of physics
Jeffrey Bowen, Coder has not
relinquished control of the funds.

The group said it needs the
money from Coder’s account to
pursue its present goals, in-
cluding baling its own paper to
sell at a higher price.

Doms said he is prepared to in-
itiate legal action with the sup-
port of the club. He said Coder
“Jost involvement in the club long
ago. He is looking for just his. so-
called promises to the town,”

Doms, who will graduate in
May, said “‘after I graduate, time
won’t be a_ bother—I’ll do
anything I can to get the money.”

The club has no constitution or
by-laws specifying goals and
aims. Records have been kept of
the minutes of meetings, letters,
and reports dating back to 1973,
however. Club objectives were

not set until 1975, when the group
was faced with declining paper
prices because of the economic
recession.

The club possessed $1,500 at
that time and was asked to list
priorities about the utilization of
that money.

According to the minutes of the
officer’s meeting on Feb. 22, 1975
— which Doms made available to
the Bucknellian — goals were
proposed in priority order. It was
proposed that the club’s first
priority be the ‘expansion of the
program, using funds to buy
equipment and materials deemed
necessary and beneficial for the
program.”

Proposed as a second priority

_ was a “pledge of money to sup-

port the production of the
Bucknell Environmental News.”

A “scholarship and/or other
alternatives” was suggested as
the third—and lowest—priority of
the club.

However, some records of
minutes have been lost, Coder
said, and there is no physical
evidence the proposal was passed
by the general membership.

Doms said he spoke to three
past presidents of the club and
they told him the goals as pro-
posed at that meeting by the club
members were passed.

BISON ALUMNI

By MATT KARANIAN

A bomb threat was received at the PhiGamma
Delta fraternity house at 12:50 a.m. Thursday
warning that a party in progress at the fraternity
“was going to blow up,” according to Lewisburg
Police Chief Donald Heiter.

Police evacuated 80 people afrom the building
after the threat was made by an anonymous
telephone caller. Police have no leads or
suspects in the case.

Heiter said Lewisburg police received a call
for assistance from Fiji president Steve
Papariello ’81 at 12:57 a.m. Papariello said Fiji
member Dave Marren ’83 received the bomb
threat when he answered the house phone.

Marren informed Papariello of the threat, and
Papariello said he “took a couple of minutes to
decide whether it was a prank or real.”

He said he then decided ‘‘to be safe,” and sum-
moned police a few minutes after the threat was
made.

Police arrived ‘“‘a minute or two later,”
Papariello said. Heiter said he closed Universi-
ty Ave. — the street on which the fraternity is

located — from Barton St. to Malcom St.
Police searched the fraternity for explosive
devices but found nothing and gave up the search

-at 2:30 a.m.

Although he was not using “special equip-
ment,” Heiter said he could have identified a
bomb.

If an explosive device had been found, Heiter
said he would have ‘‘cleared the whole block,”
and notified a “bomb disposal unit and demoli-
tion team.”

Although no bomb was found, Heiter said he
told fraternity members at the time that he could
not ‘guarantee’ there was no bomb. He
estimated 40-60 people re-entered the building.
The others who were evacuated, most of whom
had been attending a party the fraternity was
sponsoring, left the area.

Bucknell security officers also responded to
the call for assistance from the fraternity.

Papariello said he had “no idea” who might
have phoned the bomb scare. “I guess it was just
a prank. Somebody must have gotten a kick out
of it.””

Zeller said he wrote to the
Pennsylvania Department of

questing permission for the
University to pay for and install
more lighting and an additional
flashing warning light.

He is also seeking to establish
an agreement with the East Buf-

tersection and to catch persons
who “run the light.”

PennDOT has yet to reply to
Zeller’s inquiry. Zeller said the
University has ‘‘no other plans at
this time” for insuring safety at
the intersection.

Zeller said the possibility of
constructing a tunnel or bridge
was raised ‘“‘a couple of years
ago,”’ and was found to be pro-
hibitively expensive.

“There is also the problem with
security — muggings could occur
in a tunnel, and a bridge would
have to meet requirements for

Zeller’s request to PennDOT
came on the heels of an accident

calling for greater safety
measures at the intersection.

CounseLine has 185 listeners
of tapes about social problems

By MADELON HENEHAN

CounseLine, the University telephone counselling
and referral service, has received 185 inquiries
since its reintroduction Sept. 26.

CounseLine, initiated by the Counseling Service
and the Office of Residential Life, provides 54 taped
messages dealing with social problems. The
messages may be heard by phoning ona special line
and requesting a desired topic. The messages are
run 7to9 minutes long each.

Located in the Counseling Service office in the
Botany Building, CounseLine phones are manned
by the counseling staff during their office hours and
by upperclass volunteers after hours. If the lines
are not in operation when a person calls, an answer-
ing machine provides a phone number to call in case
of emergency.

Counseline began its operations in September
1978 after investing $325 in Self-Help tapes from the
University of Texas, counseling service. According

to Arlene Hoyt of the service, the rationale behind
the program is “to reach students and to let them
know there are people on campus interested in their
personal and psychological well being.”’

Almost 600 calls were answered in 1978, but the
number of calls decreased in following years. Hoyt
said reasons for the decline included, ‘‘understaff-
ing” and the program’s “not being in people’s
minds.”

Although total calls are tabulated, there is no way
of estimating the actual number of students who use
the phone, Hoyt said. “But 35 to 40 percent of the
students will have some contact with the Counseling
service in the four years they are here,” she added.

CounseLine does not operate after 6 p.m.
weekends. Hoyt said she would “‘love to see” hours
extended. “I’d like coverage, but it’s hard to find
students to answer the phones,” she said.

Nurse’s absence has
women’s group mad

By MATT KARANIAN

The Women’s Concern Group is
initiating a petition calling for the
temporary placement of a
woman nurse or doctor on the stu-
dent medical services staff.

The staff now consists entirely
of men, and the women’s group is
seeking to have a woman serve in
addition to the men as a
gynecological practitioner.

Rozalyn Yannaccone, a nurse
practitioner in gynecology,
served as the medical service’s
only female practitioner from
September 1978 until June. She is
now on a maternity leave of
absence and she will not return to
work until Feb. 1.

There are no women now on the
staff, and the Women’s Concern
Group wants to see a woman
hired “‘at least temporarily”’ ac-
cording to group spokesman Don-
na Spinweber ’81.

University Medical Director
Dr. Joseph Weightman said there
are no plans to fill her post as
practitioner. Although Weight-
man said he ‘‘appreciates having
a nurse of feminine gender for
girls,” he said the male doctors
have been ‘doing it for years”
and are ‘competent profes-
sionals.”

Weightman said the dispensary
can take care of any medical pro-
blems women have. Although
“individuals prefer the same
gender”’ for medical matters, itis
“all a part of their work”’ for the
male doctors, he said.

The medical services can func-
tion properly in dealing with
emergencies until Yannaccone
returns from her leave Feb. 1.,

“Weightman said. “‘Illnesses are

taken care of” and birth control
counseling is still provided, he

se

said.

Weightman said he has heard
no complaints from students
because of Yannaccone’s tem-
porary leave. ‘‘Students may say
‘Oh I wish she were here,’ but
there have been no problems,”
the medical director said.

Spinweber said women here do
not feel comfortable with the
male doctors.

Yannaccone said she provides
the same services as the male
doctors at the dispensary. “If
someone needs an exam they can
still get it,” she said.

“T guess what the women really
miss is someone to talk to when
they have problems. Most of my
time was spent answering ques-
tions and giving advice ”

Yannaccone was hired two
years ago following persistent
complaints from undergraduate
women that a female was needed
on the medical staff and the
subsequent reccommendation to
that effect by a student and facul-
ty committee.

FM power increase delay over

By NANCY McMANUS

After a delay caused by a prolonged
engineering study, University radio station
WVBU has accepted a proposal from Radio
Systems Inc. to purchase $23,000 of equipment
necessary to increase its power.

_ The FM station will be increasing its power
to 456.8 watts stereo by the start of the spring
semester, according to Station Manager Liz
Hawley ’80.

The Federal Communications Commission
ruled in 1979 that 10-watt educational stations
must increase their power to at least 100
watts, or be forced off the air. WVBU filed
with the FCC for a power increase in June,
1979, and received a construction permit from
the Commission to increase its power to 11,169
watts June 12. A power increase of this
magnitude would have enabled the station to
be heard as far as Williamspost.

The station was also granted permission to
move its tower from its present location on
the roof of Roberts Hall to a tower owned by a
local radio station WTCG on Armor Road in
Lewisburg.

These plans, however, were contingent
upon a National Telecommunications In-
formation Administration grant of $30,000.
The NTIA did not make any of the funds

ilable.

Without the NTIA grant, the radio station
could not afford to increase its power to the
originally proposed wattage. WVBU is
therefore in the process of revising its ap-
plication to the FCC for a modified power in-
crease.

WVBU is also seeking to transfer its tower
site to the roof of the power house at the
Physical Plant building, rather than to a site
provided by WTGC.

Hawley said this amendment was to be
resubmitted to the FCC this week.

Before WVBU was able to draft a new pro-
posal to the FCC, a new engineering study had
to be completed. The study was required by
the FCC to demonstrate that the increase in
power would not interfere with the broadcast
signals of nearby stations.

Last year, Ed Perry, a consulting engineer
from Rombury, Mass., contracted with
WVBU to complete the engineering study,
which he promised to complete by March. His
consulting firm was exceptionally busy,
however, and maps for the study were not
completed until last month. This six month
delay of the results of the engineering study
caused WVBU’s delay in increasing its power.

Although it may be a matter of months
before WVBU hears from the FCC on its new
amendment to increase to 456.8 watts, there is

no forseeable cause for further delay, ac-
cording to FM Program Director Jay
Cresswell ’81. Cresswell said the FCC will
most likely approve the revision since it calls
for less of an overall power increase than the
originally planned increase.

The proposal from Radio Systems was ac-
cepted Friday after a meeting attended by
John Zeller, Jerry Rackoff, John Dunlop,
Dean of Student Affairs, Roland King, WVBU
station advisor, and the station’s Board of
Directors.

WVBU will be purchasing equipment in-
cluding a 40-foot tower, a transmitter, an
emergency broadcasting system encoder,
and a stereo monitor. A new console has
already been ordered, and will be installed
during fall break. The rest of the equipment is
hoped to be installed in January, Hawley said.

The ABS has loaned WVBU $24,000 to pur-
chase the new equipment. WVBU plans to
repay $7,000 in installments of $1,400 for a
period of five years. An additional $1,000 will
be repaid to the ABS after five years to cover
the cost of the consulting firm

Hawley said one third of the amount WVBU
is to repay the ABS has already been raised
through fund drives.

The station is not required to repay the
$15,000 balance of t ‘

lecture by

By STEVE GARFINKEL

Comprehensive economic sanc-
tions against South Africa are not
likely to be productive, according
to Professor and Chairman of the
Department of Political Science
Newell Stultz of Brown Universi-
ty.
He spoke to an audience of 75
persons in the University Center
Forum Tuesday night as a guest
of the annual James Gathings
Lectureship in International
Relations.

Stultz’s hour-long presentation,
“Thinking About South Africa: A
Reexamination of Some Maxims
and Axioms,’’ drew heavily from
a 1964 article by Philip Mason, he
said.

Mason’s article, an effort
describg the ‘lines of policy”
that the United States and Great
Britain should take regarding
aparthied in South Africa,
presented some axioms—
postulations of foreign policy—
regarded as true, and some
maxims—policy prescriptions—
based on these axioms.

Stultz described and explained
each maxim. The U.S. and Bri-
tain prefer friendship in dealing
with South Africa, and are deter-
mined to see the “‘graceful retire-
ment” of the government of
South Africa, he said.

The U.S. and Britain should ex-
plicitly state this as their goal,
Stultz said. Mason’s article also
advocated a minimum amount of

O’Brien to

By GREG HAHN

University President Dennis
O’Brien will meet in New York
City Wednesday with the creator
of the Sullivan principles.

The principles—a standard of
corporate conduct designed to
safeguard and promote the
welfare of South African blacks
in employment, housing, educa-
tion and health— are a key ele-
ment in the University’s tentative
plan for selective divestiture of
University holdings of companies
that have subsidiaries in South
Africa.

O’Brien was invited to attend a
meeting with the Rev. Leon
Sullivan by a group of college
presidents including Swarthmore
College president Theodore
Friend. He said he is not sure of
the specific agenda,

The University’s board of
trustees voted in December 1979
to boycott companies which did
not follow the Sullivan guidelines
as a protest against South
African apartheid.

A committee of trustees
chaired by John P. Swanson of
Tenafly, N.J. is in the process of
determining which of the com-
panies in which the University
has holdings follows the Sullivan
principles.

Despite dwindling member-
ship, the Bucknell Alliance
Against Aparthied (BAAA) is ac-
tively seeking total divesture of
University stocks in corporations
with affiliates in the Republic of
South Africa.

Two years ago, the BAAA had
support of 100 more students and

Brown U.

bloodshed in South Africa during
the change of government.

“South Africa is the world’s
business” and the United Nations
must develop a policy which ex-
emplifies this stance, Stutz told
the mixed audience of students
and faculty. Mason’s axioms also
included an assertion that in-
dependent internal revolution in
South Africa is not likely to be
successful.

The ‘former Nixon administra-
tion stance” on this was that the
whites of South Africa are there
to stay, and effective change can
be reached only through ‘them,
Stultz said.

“The South African govern-
ment will not fail through
weakness,” and direct armed in-
tervention in South Africa is not
advisable, Stultz said, as South
Africa is now a formidable
power. Prosperity will not be an
acceptable type of compensation
for or lead to an end of aparthied
in South Africa, he said.

Economic sanctions or naval
blockades of South Africa are
likely to cause resentment from
neighboring countries in the
region, since trade would be in-
terrupted at other points and thus
affecting other countries, Stultz
said.

Stultz continued his recounting
of Mason’s axioms by stating that
general sanctions are unlikely to
be successful without the par-
ticipation and support of the U.S.

meet with

faculty members, but less than a
dozen students and faculty are
active with the organization to-
day.

The BAAA has set a short-
range goal of educating the
Bucknell community about apar-
theid. The group does not believe
selective divesture to be the right
move.

BAAA co-coordinator Carolyn
Berner ’81 said the Sullivan Prin-
ciples are not specific enough and
do not provide for any voting
privileges or participation in the
government. She said the prin-

and Britain. In this case, he said,
these two countries would have to
consult with other nations who do
not possess United Nations veto
power, such as Japan and West
Germany.

Since South Africa has diver-
sified the nations with which she
trades, there are many practical
difficulties in coordinating a
trade embargo with ‘‘a high level
of effectiveness,’’ he said.

Multinational corporations can
“easily avoid” the constraints
placed upon them by govern-
ments, Stultz said, and therefore
a trade embargo is unlikely to be
very effective in combating apar-
thied, according to his recounting
of Mason’s article.

Stultz explained five alter-
natives which, in light of Mason’s
maxims and axioms, would pro-
mote ‘‘democracy in South Africa
without bloodshed.”’

A comprehensive economic
sanction is an alternative that
likely will not take place, Stultz
said. The U.S. and Britain are too
economically tied to South Africa
to simply divest all interests in
that country, he said. Trade is
especially important to Britain,
for it controls one-third of the
total investments in South Africa.
The value of South African in-
vestments have increased three
and one-half times. This explains
why countries that deal with
South Africa refuse to vote for
sanctions, while those who are

Sullivan Principles’

ciples have not been effective and
blames the vagueness of the
rating system for this.

Masato Aoki ’82, another BAAA
co-coordinator, said there is ‘‘ex-
treme” racial segregation and
rule by the minority in South
Africa. He described cir-
cumstances where blacks — who
comprise nearly three-fourths of
the population—are prohibited
from voting and are limited to
menial jobs by the white ruling
class.

Iran attacks ships;
men flee as 20 die

Iranians holed up in the oil
seaport of Khurramshahr have
shelled, and reportedly sunk, five
foreign cargo ships anchored off
the shore, according to survivors
of the incident who managed to
swim to the Iraqi shore.

These sources believe that as
many as 20 crew members may
have been killed in the attack. 120
sailors and officers, some wound-
ed, made it to shore on the Iraqi
side of the waterway in which the
cargo vessels were anchored.

Some of the ships were in the

becoming the second member of

charges stemming from that in-
vestigation.

A 12-man jury took only four

with taking the first installment
on a $100,000 bribe in return for

Pennsylvania and its 27 electoral

Carter won the state with the
third most electoral votes in 1976,
and he has the additional ad-
vantage that Democrats out-
number Republicans here by
733,000. But a Time survey gave
the former California governor a
17 percent lead over the presi-

No emergency yet
from low river level

Low water levels in the Sus-

caused an emergency situation

Richard Cairo, secretary to the
Susquehanna River Basin Com-
mission, which has regulatory
control over the basin. ‘‘The pro-
blems lie with the small towns
which are dependent on small
reservoirs,”’ he said.

The commission monitors river
levels, and if it reaches drought
levels, they ‘will take whatever
action necessary to relieve it,”
Cairo said.

The commission can take
emergency action, such as water
rationing or diversion, only after
holding a public hearing in the af-

‘New Morality’ subject of Fall colloquy

~~ Photo—John Staudinger
TURNAU LECTURES—Roger Turnau, executive director of the
Susquehanna Valley Health Care Consortium, addresses an
early evening audience in the University Lounge of the Uni-
versity Center Friday with a lecture titled “Ethical Problems
in the Governmental Regulation of Health Care.” Turnau’s
talk focuséd on the problem of medical regulations forcing the
“rationing” of health care services.

By MARY LISA MURGIANO

Four guest lecturers spoke Friday on the
Dehumanization of Death and Ethical Problems in
Government Regulation of Health Care as part of
Fall Colloquy, ‘““The New Morality of Life and
Death.”

Dr. George Mallory, a Lewisburg pediatrician;
Alan ‘Lumpkin, Chaplain at Geisinger Medical
Center, and Mark Bauer, a student at the University
of Pennsylvania School of Medicine and a member
of the Medical Ethics Society there spoke on death
in the 1980s and the attitudinal, technological and
social changes toward death which have recently
arisen.

The lecture was presented to a sparse audience in
the University Center Forum.

According to Dr. Mallory, “Death is destiny,
universal, solitary and compulsory.” Certain facts
about death are and will remain the same, but other
aspects of it change. Mallory said death was natural
and personal in the 19th century—an individual died
at home, surrounded by family.

Conversely, Mallory said that in the 20th century
death is vastly different as the modern hospital has
become the site for death; a place where family
members are ‘“‘removed.” Mallory said death has
become ‘‘a by-product of technological progress,”
primarily because it can be postponed with today’s
technology.

Along with these concrete changes, Mallory said

formation sources and lack of openness about the

Panel probes death ‘Dehumanization’

there are attitudinal changes about death. Doctors
have become more open in telling patients they are
dying.

While Bauer expressed concern over the solitude
of death and the difficulty of facing it, he defended
the physician who did not become emotionally in-
volved ina patient’s death.

Although he agreed with Mallory that ‘‘someone”’
has to help reconcile a patient and his family to the
facts of death, he maintained that it was not the job
of the doctor.

“There is very little room for philosophical or
emotional development in the training of physi-
cians. We are overloaded with information and time
commitments. It’s impossible to spend that extra
hour talking to the patient,” Bauer said.

Lumpkin then offered his definition of
dehumanization to the audience and built his argu-
ment around that. According to Lumpkin,

“Dehumanization is isolation.”

“We must treat the person with the disease,”
Lumpkin said, “rather than the disease that’s got
the person.’’

and how long you'll stay,” said Grace Monaco, a

Washington attorney, speaking Saturday in the

University Center Forum before a crowd of twenty
sons.

Her lecture, “The Legal Aspects of Death,
Euthanasia, and Unproven Methods of Cancer
Treatment,” was one of the concluding lectures of
the Fall ’80 Colloquy: “The New Morality of Life
and Death.”

Monaco, president of the Candlelighters’ Founda-
tion for parents with children who have cancer,
became interested in health laws when her
daughter died from leukemia at the age of 4. She has
received awards for her work in pediatric cancer
and is a member of a special council for the
American Cancer Society.

Monaco said there is a contrast between the drug
approval process and the unproven methods of
cancer treatment. ‘The purpose of the drug ap-
proval process is to provide quality information
which will permit people to make intelligent deci-

underpinnings of the way things work.”

Monaco cited the 1979 Supreme Court Case of .
Rutherford vs. the United States in which the :
Supreme Court promulgated that the terminally ill ,

had as much right to the protection of food and drug

laws as anyone else. Recognizing the right for a pa-
tient to refuse treatment, it affirmed that a patient

lacks the constitutional right to choose an inefficient ;

drug for treatment.

Louise Knight, a local attorney and University ad-
junct professor, said the increased difficulty in
defining death is a result of the emergence of organ
transplants. Medical technology has abrogated the
common law, which states that ‘“‘anyone having cir-
culation and respiration is alive.”

“There is no agreement on euthanasia, the act of
killing for reasons of mercy,” she said:

The California Natural Death Act, Knight said,
“has made the decision making process easier.” It
allows an individual to express in writing whether
or not be wants his life artificially extended when
the time comes.

Pulling the purse strings

Remember when you were young and Aunt Ella gave you some
money or you earned a few cents somehow? Wasn’t it frustrating if
Mom wouldn’t let you buy that candy bar, the way you wanted to?

The Recycling Club has a bank account of $4,633 comprising its
earnings from 1972-79. Bob Doms ’81, president of the club, wants to
use the money in part to bale the paper to be recycled for a better
sale price. With the increased funds earned from this innovation, the
club could expand its objectives.

Presently, the recycling effort on campus is severely hindered
by a lack of collection boxes, student awareness, and administration
concern and support. There is no organized effort for aluminum
reclamation. Instead of making money, the University pays to have

. its many recyclables towed away toa landfill.

$4,633 could do a lot for the Recycling Club and their badly need-
ed efforts here — but Professor Charles Coder, club advisor until
last year, tenaciously refuses to allow the club access to the money it
has earned. The funds are in an account under his name and he says
he will not allow them to be used for anything other than a scholar-
ship.

Doms says that the use of the money should be left to the club’s
discretion. He is right.

Student organizations are not meant to be controlled by their ad-
visors. Nor their past advisors. The money earned by the Recycling
Club does not belong to Coder.

This is college — not kids and candy bars. The issue is not
whether Coder’s designations for the money are more worthy than
the intentions of the Recycling Club. The fact is that Coder and the

University are overstepping their bounds. Bu ckn ellian

Alumni, Volvos, argyles, & patches

By SCOTT BUCHHOLZ

The “Welcome Home Bucknellians” banner over
Moore Avenue alerts all members of the Bucknell
community of this weekend’s extravaganza known
as Homecoming. In fleets of Volvos alumni travel
great distances to their alma mater, Universitas
Bucknellensis. Throughout the United States, from
Scarsdale to Chevy Chase, the urge to return to
one’s collegiate home beckons.

What can be said of these former inhabitants of
Kress, Roberts, Swartz and Larison? Why do they
return to Bucknell? Surely a receding hairline and a
bit of a paunch around the midsection are nothing to
show off. But when you think of it, most alumni
probably display the same characteristics.

Radical alumni would have us think that
Homecoming is a plot by capitalists in the Universi-
ty fund raising office toincrease annual giving. This
may be true, but do we really need another park
bench?

Probably the most interesting thing about
Homecoming is learning that clothing styles do not
change much after graduation. The way our alumni
wear their clothes is a bit different. The mono-
grammed sweaters are still in. However, the alum-
ni bring us a new fixation, patches. I can’t decide if
this innovation is a result of age or style.

Patches are a very common item in the wardrobe
of former Bucknellians, whetber on corduroy,
jackets or wool sweaters. I have even noticed pat-
ches on Bucknell’s favorite sock, the argyle.

There is also the biggest patch of all—the patch-
work pants that remind me of walking bed quilts. To
see an alumnus in that costume makes me wish it
were summer.

But enough about these collegiate forms of dress,
the purpose of which is to relate to times past. There
is more to the alumni than the outward appearance
they bring back to Bucknell. They carry minds full
of memories of fraternity parties and football
games. Their stories are retold and retold and...

The alumni trying to prove themselves against
undergraduates in events such as swimming, soc-
cer and beer drinking has to be seen to be believed.
Unfortunately for the undergraduates and their
egos, it is often unbelievable.

And so the spectacle will occur this weekend.
Besides Bucky’s Place, the parade and football
game, we will be treated to an open-air fashion show
of traditional collegiate styles, including patches,
anda look at this year’s new Volvos.

They have returned.

Election casualties:
language, rhetoric

By ERIC HOERNER

Faced with three dubious choices in this year’s Presidential elec-
tion, it is doubtful that American voters will elect a winner Nov. 4. The
new dimension of a third candidate means there will be two official
losers on Election Day. Two non-candidate losers have emerged
already however: the English language and logical rhetoric.

Political campaigns are often mass exercises in hyperbole, but this
year the abuses are especially blatant. For example, on Tuesday in
Chicago President Carter told a crowd, ‘‘You’ll have to determine
whether America will be unified or, if I lose the election, whether
America will be separated, black from white, Jew from Christian,
North from South, or rural from urban.”

On military policy Carter claims that Reagan would “‘lead our coun-
try into war.”’

Ronald Reagan responded to the remarks by saying that Carter’s at-
tacks had reached a “point of paranoia’’ and called him a “badly
misinformed and predjudiced man.”

He did not ask for a personal apology, but called for Carter to
apologize to the American people.

This response was reserved considering the severity of Carter’s
remarks. It would be easy to make a list of Reagan’s outrageous and
impractical statements.

Both candidates are guilty of using the usual campaign exaggera-
tions. But Carter’s extreme remarks transcend hyperbole and demean
the office of the President. Carter should concentrate more on his own
record rather than personally attacking his opponent.

Johnny and Ellen were tantalizing and deafening

By TODD G. BUCHHOLZ

My right ear is starting to hear
again. It went on strike for a
week to protest the sound levels it
was subjected to during the
Southside Johnny concert Satur-
day night.

At the next concert, I'll know
not to sit on the floor close to the
speakers. Benjamin Franklin
said, “experience is the hardest
school, but fools will learn in no
other.”

Ben was right. I learned my
lesson.

As for the concert, it was an ap-
parent success. And the Concert
Committee achieved its goal of
starting the year with a winner.

I was most impressed, though,
with Southside’s personal ap-
pearance. How many performers
still wear white shirts and black
ties? Had I known the concert

was a formal affair, I would have
dressed a little better.

The fact that Southside—in a fit
of artistic inspiration—ripped off

clean-cut, neat and well-dressed.

In fact, when I first saw him, I
thought he was a high school kid
applying for admission to
Bucknell. Maybe the Davis Gym
stage is one of the admission’s

tour stops.

Southside’s singing was pretty
good, too. Frankly, I didn’t know
what he said most of the time, but
he sounded as if he had a decent
voice.

The Asbury Jukes were ex-
emplary. The brass and sax-
ophone sections added a lot of en-

My favorite group, though, was
the audience. Nearly 2500 people
sitting on one another’s laps in a

be crushed,”’ he said.

So far so good. But when Ellen
Shipley came on stage, everyone
jumped to their feet and crept
forward, closer to the stage. Five
minutes later, when students
wanted to sit down again, the
gym floor seemed to have
shrunk.

You had to revert to the fetal
position to find a piece of the
floor. Most people managed, ex-
cept for the two in front of me
who didn’t sit down quickly
enough. They looked around like
the losers in a game of musical
chairs. There was absolutely no
room left.

Soon the pelting began.
Students who couldn’t see
through the two people standing

threw paper at them. Scientific
types created supersonic
transport planes out of their pro-
grams. The two looked like the
targets of a kamikaze mission.

Finally, they crawled over the
crowd and escaped.

Throughout this whole sordid
escapade, Ellen continued to
charm and tantalize. If you
thought Southside was dressed by
Halston, or at least Calvin Klein,
consider Ellen. Her jeans were so
tight she had to hunch over like
an anthropoid.

She was a philosopher too,
screaming things like: ‘‘You’ve
gotta make a promise to yourself
and keep it—no matter what!
And it gets rough! Uh-huh,
Doobee UH-huh!” She was a real
Aristotle—or at least an O’Brien.

Bucknell’s OK; Ivy's

By DAVID HAWKINGS

What is going on in the Ivy
League schools, those bastions of
academic freedom, enormous en-
dowments and century-old tradi-
tions?

A close reading of the New
York Times, this newspaper and
even ‘“What’s Happening” has
revealed some interesting anec-
dotes that should prove beyond a
shadow of a doubt that—even if
the rumor about Bucknell being
asked to join the Ivy League was

To the Editor:

Why is it that so many well-
intentioned and highly moral peo-
ple think that the end justifies the
means? Why do the single-issue
proponents so often act in conflict
with the very principles they en-
dorse?

Acase in point is the writing in
chalk on the pillars of Coleman
Hall or Marts Hall by the anti-
nuke supporters. Do they really
think that promotes their cause?
Aren’t they concerned about the
aesthetic aspects of their en-
vironment?

People who write on buildings
are nerds, however commend-
dable their purpose.

true—we should never accept the
offer.

At Princeton, the new female
students were asked recently to
recount in as explicit detail as
they could their most intimate
sexual experiences — and on
Princeton stationery as well. The
school actually has a center for
the study of human sexuality, but
the staff there knew nothing
about the questions that were
asked on the center’s forged let-
terhead.

Nobody else seems to either.
Local printers, students and
faculty questioned as part of a
“fullscale inquiry” by the ad-
ministration are silent ... and so
now are most of the freshman
women when asked to tell the
school anything more personal
than their name.

At Yale, the physical plant peo-
ple decided to fix some leaky
faucets, a few disheveled roofs
and some faulty old wiring — to
the tune of $4 million. It must be
nice to have that kind of money to
do the things our Physical Plant
appears to do for free. No one is
saying their work is free, but
have you ever heard of John Bell
announcing he was spending
twice the cost of the new com-
puter center on things like broken
windows and faulty jukeboxes in
the Bison?

Along the same lines, Cornell
has announced the formation ofa
program in environmental

sciences with more money back-
ing it than we receive in annua:
giving. Our fledging program in
that discipline — long in the mak-
ing and constantly strapped for
funds — could operate com-
fortably for 10 years on that
specialized endowment in Ithaca.

Dartmouth continues to be
name conscious. Just concluding
a controversy concerning the
traditional Indian mascot (it was
decided the symbol implied a
racial slur), the Hanover campus
is now embroiled in a dispute
about a second student
newspaper’s desire to use the
word ‘‘Dartmouth’”’ in its name.

Both controversies would seem
moot here. If anyone were to
criticize the use of the locally ex-
tinct bison, it would have been
when the beast died long ago. As
for the emergence of a second
paper here...

Columbia’s new president,
Michael Sovern, was in-
naugurated Sunday with more
fanfare that at the coronations of
most of the world’s heads of
state. There were more schools
represented in academic regalia
than we have faculty. Perhaps
that is because Sovern walked
behind a marshal carrying a 50-
pound ceremonial mace of
authority. Dennis O’Brien gets

Brown has been in the local

Harvard remains conspicuous

All the rumors about
Bucknell’s asking or being asked

have always been false. For bet-

For all the money, age and

Bucknell’s humbleness on all
counts puts it in a class by itself.

Homecoming 80

Unique bands and floats
highlight annual parade

By SUSAN MACDONALD

Billed as the most spectacular ever by
the Homecoming Committee, the 1980
Homecoming Parade will feature mar-
ching, dixieland and kitchen bands, the
Bison Chips and barbershop music, twelve
floats, golf carts, as well as a variety of
clowns, jugglers, and unicyclists.

The parade begins Saturday at 10:30
a.m. at the Lewisburg High School and will
proceed up Market Street to Third Street,
then up Moore Avenue through campus.

One of the highlights of the parade will
be the debut of the Roy Grier Botswick Kit-
chen Band. Membership was open to all
the cafeteria workers, who will be mar-
ching to their beat of pots, pans and other
kitchen utensils. However, the Bostwick
Band is not the only kitchen band to be ap-
pearing in the parade. The New Columbia

tie
The

For a switch in musical tastes, there will
also be a Dixieland band playing songs like
“Hello Dolly,’’ “When the Saints Go Mar-
ching In,” and “Basin Street Blues.”
Members of the Dixieland Band include
Scott Armacost ’82 on trumpet; Rick Focke
’80, trombone; Joe Fantuzzi ’80, piano;
Bob Ritter ’83, drums; Assistant Professor
of Philosophy Richard Brockhaus on tuba,
and Mark Krauss, ’74, with clarinet.

The Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity’s
kazoo band will only be appearing ‘‘if the
float falls through,”’ said float chairman
Sam Niness ’82. The float theme is ‘‘Score
on the Leopards”’ and will feature a Bison
crushing or running over the Lafayette
leopard.

Alpha Chi Omega sorority and Delta Up-
silon fraternity are combining their talents
for another of the floats. Gordie Stetz ’83

ison Marching Band is slated to perform at halftime Saturday. With

them will be appearing alumni members of the band

Senior Citizen’s Home Band makes use of
similar instruments, but with one major
difference. All of their members are more
than 70 years old and will be riding on a
flatbed truck.

More traditional music will be provided
by the Bison Marching Band, the
Lewisburg High School Band and the
Bucknell Alumni Band. The Alumni Band
has more than 90 members returning to
play, notably Vice President for Ad-
ministration and Finance John Zeller ’41
on the cymbals.

Dave Maahr, the 1975 PGA champion
and an ABC Sports commentator, will be
in the parade as part of the celebration
honoring the Golf Club’s 50th anniversary.
In addition, the alumni who initiated the
club will be riding through in golf carts.

Associate Professor of Japanese Studies
James Pusey will not be appearing in any
of the bands, but his music will still be
prominent—he’ll only be playing the
bagpipes. Pusey got involved in the parade
only by chance. One of the Homecoming
Committee members spotted the ‘‘Support
Your Local Piper” bumper sticker on the
back of his car and left a message for him
to join. If the weather cooperates, Pusey
plans to wear a kilt and full regalia.

will be sitting on top of a Bison lancing a
leopard ‘‘a stuffed leopard, not a real
one.”

Kappa Kappa’ Gamma sorority and
Sigma Chi fraternity are working together
on a “Cook the Cats” float. They plan to
have ‘‘a pot with a cat coming out, an open
recipe book, and the Bison mascot throw-
ing things at the cat,” said Ann Taggert
’82, head of the committee.

Beta Gamma sorority and Tau Kappa
Epsilon fraternity’s theme is ‘‘Knock the
Spots Off the Leopards.”

Many of the groups were experiencing
difficulties in getting flatbed trucks, but
entries are expected from fifteen
sororities and fraternities and several
freshman hall groups.

Concern and Action also plans to enter a
float and are decorating their van with
“possibly the six foot Earth ball,” said
Homecoming chairperson Ginny Bagley
81.

Cap and Dagger members will be ap-
pearing in the parade dressed as street
players and clowns. In addition, they will
be having a float showing scenes from the
first three of the season’s plays: ‘‘Tar-
tuffe,” ‘Vanities,’ and ‘‘A Funny Thing
Happened on the Way to the Forum.”

Initiated by the General Alumni Association, the first Homecom-
ing Weekend was held in 1921. That year the festivities attracted a
record crowd of 4,000 to Bucknell. The popularity of Homecoming
has grown steadily in the years since, and so have the variety of ac-
tivities.

In the early days of hazing and “Hell Week,’’ Homecoming
weekend frequently contributed to the misery of the freshman
male.

Committed to wearing small hats called “dinks,” black ties and
black socks during weekdays from September to Thanksgiving,
Homecoming of 40 years ago offered a chance for freshmen to
escape these degrading uniforms.

In the annual ‘‘Freshman-Sophomore Scrap” supervised by the

Homecoming Weekend frequently contribut-
ed to the misery of the freshman male.

Student-Faculty Congress, freshmen had 10 minutes to shimmy up

a well-guarded, greased pole in an attempt to capture the
sophomore class colors. If the attempt was successful, they were
free to doff their dinks.

To escape the black socks and ties, the freshmen had to battle the
sophomores in a five-minute “tug-of-war” contest. These unof-
ficial contests added to the excitement prior to the annual
Homecoming football game. ,

Throughout the 20s, alumni dinners and alumni-student
assemblies were the primary focus of nighttime social activity. In
1933, Bucknellians returned to their alma mater to play ina golf
tournament, cheer around a bonfire and watch a Bucknell-Temple
soccer game.

Fraternity-sponsored dances were the rage that year, although
there was also an all-campus dance. Of course, a strict midnight
curfew was in operation for the women and professors and their
wives chaperoned all social functions. se

Homecoming Parade started in 1937. Fraternities
and sororities participateu in float competitions and local mer-
chants decorated their store windows in an attempt to capture first
place, which was awarded by the Torch and Scroll Honor Society, a
forerunner of the Mortar Board Honor Society of today.

World War II brought a change for those who were able to return.
In deference to the war effort, festivities were toned down. In 1942,
the parade was cancelled because of shortages of supplies. That
same year, Sigma Alpha Mu sponsored a “war stamp dance”’
which required each couple to buy a 25-cent stamp at the door.

In 1948, the parade was also cancelled, but this time it was fora
less than patriotic reason. The Bucknellian explained on Sept. 30
there would be no parade “inasmuch as Some of the frater-
nities and sororities are unwilling to devote time to such a project
in addition to the regular weekend activities.”

In 1955, Bucknell had its first Homecoming Queen. Each can-
didate rode on a float in the parade. Faculty wives had the honor of
choosing the winner on the basis of attractiveness and poise. The
queen and her court then waved to the crowd during the halftime of
the football game.

The tradition of Homecoming Queen continued throughout the
1960s, though the selection process was modified and she was
elected by the student body. Faculty and administrators nominated
four young women, who were each pictured and written up the the
Bucknellian. Students then voted for their favorite. Not
until 1974 were the Homecoming hostsand hostesses of today in-
itiated.

The student newspaper’s coverage of Homecoming has has also
evolved throughout the years. In the early forties the Bucknellian
served mainly as an information sheet to alumni during Homecom-
ing. Marriages, engagements, births and deaths were all dutifully
recorded.

In 1960, the Bucknellian featured a special Homecoming “color-
ing book page,”’ depicting such characters as ‘‘the Ivy League stu-
dent,” the ‘penniless parents of the college student,”’ and “the
wealthy returning alumni.”

High school aged children of returning alumni were welcomed to
Homecoming 1967 by a meeting with the admissions staff to discuss
college admissions procedures. Children of alumni are still granted
interviews during Homecoming if they think they may be in-
terested in attending Bucknell. -

The passing of nearly 60 years has not dimmed the attractions of
Homecoming Weekend or, at least to the returning alumni, their
alma mater. Graduates of the classes of 1927 through 1980 will be
here this weekend to get a few glimpses of Bucknell and remember
their college years.

The 1955 winner of the Homecoming float contest
paraded up Moore Avenue, urging the Bisons to
defeat Colgate. This year the entries will have
themes dealing with archrival Lafayette.

Petermann, Schaberg discuss
pursuit and hiring of bands

By KEN QUAAS

“It’s anti-climactic for us,” Chris Petermann
81, chairman of the Concert Committee, said in
reference to the live performance of the band his
committee had signed.

In an interview with the Bucknellian Monday
night, Petermann and Rich Schaberg ’81, the com-
mittee’s assistant chairman, described the
mechanics and considerations involved in schedul-
ing a concert here.

The two days before the concert are “the most
hectic,” according to Petermann. “You don’t
sleep much Friday night worrying that something
— anything — will go wrong.”

These final days are when ‘we get to see the
results of a lot of hard work,” Petermann said.

The chairman begins his committee’s search for
performers by phone, contacting the committee’s
two liaisons with the professional music business,
Monarch Entertainment and Harris Goldberg Con-
cert Ideas, both of New York City.

“J call them and they give me a list of
availabilities and fees. They know our capabilities
and limitations, both financially and with the gym,
and tell us who we can’t have right off the bat,”
Petermann said.

From this narrowed list, the committee then
votes on which band they think would be most ap-
propriate for performance here.

“When we choose, we can’t just look at the
Bucknell community, because we have to rely on
good sales in the surrounding area as well. We have
to come as close as we can to selling our 3,200
capacity,’’ Petermann said.

According to Schaberg, a band can be popular
with students here but still not be ‘‘economically
feasible” for consideration by the committee. He
cited as an example the Renaissance concert of
April 1977, which drew a crowd of 1,400 Bucknellians
but still lost money.

“We were considering the Talking Heads before
Southside,’ Petermann said, “‘but we didn’t feel
they were worth it monetarily (the group charges a
$10,000 talent fee) or on audience appeal.”

“Coordinating the musical tastes of students here
and people in the local area isn’t always easy,”
Schaberg added.

When the committee decides on a group, contract
negotiations are the next — and most lengthy — pro-
cess.

“We get a contract and immediately cross out
what we can’t afford or provide. Then we talk,”
Schaberg said.

Both Petermann and Schaberg said that many of
the demands the bands and their road crews make
are ‘‘very specific” and can “‘border on the eccen-
tric.”

An example Schaberg cited was the Van Halen
group, which has a clause in its contract demanding
the provision of two pounds of M&Ms in the dressing
rooms — with all the brown ones removed. He did
not know the reason.

Both committee members agreed that the best
part of their job is the opportunity for an inside view
of the music industry.

“The life of the roadie is most interesting,” Peter-
mann said. “They pick up and travel from one town
to the next — it’s a romanticized existence.”

From COMMITTEE, page i

Schaberg agreed with Petermann’s
statement in a Bucknellian interview Mon-
day that Southside Johnny is “fan-
conscious,” and gave this as the main
reason the band was ‘“‘as easily accessible
to us as it was.”

Schaberg said the drawbacks of Davis
Gym are many when trying to schedule a
concert. “It’s not a good place to hear a
concert acoustically, and it gets too hot.”

Petermann said putting chairs on the
floor to make the audience more com-
fortable reduces seating capacity by 1,000
and to make enough money to pay most
bands the committee must try to sell out
the 3,200 seating capacity of the gym.

Southside Johnny’s Tour Director, Jim
Butterfield, called Davis Gym “half a
trash can,” according to Schaberg. “The
roadies for Southside got here Friday mor-

ning, took one look at the place and rolled
their eyes,’’ he said.

Other drawbacks of the gym prohibiting
certain bands from playing here include
the relatively small 40-foot stage and the
inability of the gym’s electrical system to
accommodate the power of high-voltage
amplifiers, Schaberg said.

He said the concert committee had to
borrow an extra generator from the
Physical Plant to handle Southside’s light
show.

The band had recently cancelled an ap-
pearance in upstate New York because the
concert hall there did not have the proper
electrical facilities, Schaberg said.

Petermann and Schaberg said they were
“very happy” with the performance of
both Southside Johnny and his warmup
act, Ellen Shipley. Southside was ‘“‘the
smoothest band we’ve ever worked with,”
Petermann said.

Ellen Shipley, above and right, captivated the audience Saturday as a warm-up
act for Southside Johnny. Shipley’s attire and sinuous movements kept the
male portion of the crowd attentive, while her rich vocal quality could not fail
to impress all listening.

Southside plays to appreciative crowd

Performance gave Bucknellians just what they
wanted to hear from the ever-popular group

By DAVID O’CONNELL and ERIC HOERNER

A clean-cut Southside Johnny, along with his
Asbury Jukes, took the stage before a rowdy Davis
Gym crowd of 2,400 Saturday night.

In a busy night for Asbury Park, N.J. musi-
cians—Bruce Springsteen, one of Southside’s best
friends, launched his world-wide tour at the Univer-
sity of Michigan, quelling the abounding rumors
that he would make an unannounced appearance at
Bucknell—the group performed a wide selection of
songs long popular among Southside’s fans.

The popularity of the group on the East Coast
made the concert committee’s choice nearly ideal.
For all of the 90-minute show, including four en-
cores, most of the crowd remained on their feet
clapping, singing along and even dancing.

A majority of the evening’s selections were from
the group’s third album, Hearts of Stone, including
the opening number, ‘‘I Played the Fool’’ featuring
an electrifying baritone sax solo by Ed Minion.

The energetic and animated movements of the
Miami Horns in “I’m So Anxious” warmed the
crowd even more as the five brass players rocked,
dipped and exuded pure energy, both when playing
and during the rests. As in all their numbers, the
Jukes put out a maximum effort to please the crowd
and this number saw excellent solo work by
guitarists Joel Gramolini and Billy Rush.

The Jukes followed with ‘“‘Got to Get You Off My
Mind” and an even better showcasing of the in-
dividual talents of the Jukes. Rick Gazda’s brassy
trumpet solo was succeeded by an extraordinary
show of virtuosity as two saxophones were played at
once, and Richie “‘La Bamba”’ Rosenberg presented
a powerful trombone solo. Overall the number
reflected the blues style characteristic of early
Southside Johnny efforts.

Two songs from Hearts of Stone—‘‘This Time
Baby’s Gone for Good”’ and the ever-popular ‘‘Talk
to Me,” written by Bruce Springsteen—were follow-
ed by ‘“‘Long Distance,” chosen by Southside as a
mellow contrast to the hard-driving ‘Talk to Me.”
One of only two songs from the group’s latest
album, Love is a Sacrifice, released in June, it is a
typical Southside ballad, quite lyrical, yet in the
slightly more polished style of his last two albums.

Gramolini was featured again on guitar and
vocals in the next number, “‘Broke Down Piece of
Man,” and gave an excellent performance of a song
recorded before he joined the Jukes for their fourth
album. A selection from that 1979 disc, The Jukes,
was next heard. This song, the energetic ‘‘Vertigo,””
featured brass in one of the section’s better per-
formances of the evening.

“Love on the Wrong Side of Town,” another Spr-
ingsteen product, slowed the pace down by
representing what Southside termed ‘‘the only sad
song of the night.” He then led the group is a
showcase performance of “Restless Heart,” cur-

rently climbing the singles charts, which was the
other song from the Jukes’ new album.

Undoubtedly, many fans wondered why the two
other popular cuts from Love is a Sacrifice were not
played. Both “On the Beach” and “Love is a
Sacrifice’ were East Coast hits all summer and
would have provided a familiar sound for recent
Southside converts.

Springsteen’s ‘‘I Got the Fever,” from the Jukes’

first album, provided the most bluesy sounds of the,

evening as Southside moaned on the harmonica, a
musical medium in which he is quite adept. Satur-
day’s rendition contained more ‘soul’ than the early
album version, mainly because of a harp solo and
the mournful strains of Rosenberg’s trombone.

For most of the evening the guitars were over-
shadowed by the powerful Miami Horns, trademark
of the Jukes sound, however in ‘Trapped Again”
the ideal blend was achieved, providing one of the
better listening experiences of the concert.

After mentioning to the audience the pitiful lack
of quality professional sports teams in New Jersey
and a brief attempt to play the National Anthem,
Southside launched into ‘I Don’t Want to go Home,”
the title cut from the group’s debut album.

Next came the song everyone had been waiting
for, Bucknell’s weekend alma mater, ‘We're
Havin’ a Party.”’ In this, the last number of the con-
cert, the crowd’s excitement rose to the highest
pitch of the evening.

Southside obliged the unabating demands of the
audience with his first encore, “All I Want is
Everything,” and with an interesting medley of
Rolling Stones numbers played Southside Johnny
style. A third encore featured “La Bamba”
Rosenberg on piano and the concert’s appendices
ended with the title cut from Hearts of Stone.

In contrast to the average untested warm-up
band, Saturday’s bill included RCA recording ar-
tists Ellen Shipley and the Numbers, a surprisingly
professional East Coast act.

The fetching Shipley caught the attention of the
male audience with her revealing attire and won the
musical respect of all with her rich vocals. The
Brooklyn born-and-bred singer/composer was
equally adept at red-hot, hard-driving rockers and
slow ballads. Although Saturday was her first date
as warm-up act for the Jukes, one would wonder
why Southside didn’t call Shipley on stage to sing
the duet ballad ‘“You Mean So Much to Me.”

From a student standpoint, aside from the ever
bothersome Davis Gym atmosphere, Saturday’:
concert could not have been better. The choice 0
groups guaranteed the concert’s success giver
Bucknell’s East Coast demographic composition.
and as with every Southside concert, the fans were
the group’s main consideration. The Jukes aimed tc
please and the crowd responded accordingly, mak-
ing Saturday’s a most memorable concert.

‘Joni’ touching

but too preachy

By ALLISON ABOUCHAR

The movie Joni, now showing at
the Campus Theater, is the
touching story of a young woman
fighting to put her life back
together after a tragic swimming
accident leaves her paralyzed
from the shoulders down.

Joni Eareckson, who plays
herself, does an admirable job of
making the audience feel the
mental pain she faces. Her even-
tual spiritual fulfillment is the
dominant message. The ending,
however, resembles a crusade,
which makes one wonder just
how “‘preachy”’ the film was in-
tended to be. For the non-
Christian, this may be a sour note
in an otherwise harmonious film.

Overall, the portrayal lacks
realism. While the story line is
good, it packs the beginnings of
too many ideas into two hours
without carrying enough of them
through.to conclusions.

fluence over Joni’s decision to
become a Christian. It is this sort
of inconsistency that detracts
from the enjoyment of the movie.

The film, however, provides a
fresh approach to personal han-
dicaps by delving into Joni’s
spiritual life and carefully
molding the aspect of her
physical rehabilitation around
this core. Joni searches for faith
and a reason to stay alive, and
the movie effectively depicts her
finding of these things through
her commitment to Christianity.

Katherine De Hetre, playing
Joni’s sister Jay, is compas-
sionate and supportive without
getting syrupy, while Joni’s room
mates in the rehabilitation center
add a comic touch to the other-
wise heavy film.

While Joni may have technical
difficulties, it is most assuredly
worth seeing. It leaves an inspir-
ing religious message behind that
may be taken to heart by Chris-
tian viewers or glossed over by
those who are not.

Fitzwilliam Quartet
plays final concert

By AMY FORTGANG

The Fitzwilliam String Quartet demonstrated once again in their
concert Monday night why they are considered the foremost inter-
preters of Shostakovich.

Each of the four pieces performed was well-interpreted and played.
The Haydn, in particular, which can easily be played mechanically
because of the style and time period in which it was written, was
presented with a meticulous attention to depth of feeling.

The most intense emotions conveyed, though, were those trans-
mitted by the Shostakovich String Quartet No. 8.

Rooke Chapel was less full than during previous performances, and
the number of professors, administration and locals was much greater
than the number of students. It was a far cry from the Quartet’s Sept.
14 performance, for which the hall was packed with equal numbers of
students and non-students.

The logical deduction made from this observation is that for the first
concert there was not as much academic pressure on students as there
is now; thus it was easier for students to take time away from their
studies.

This noticeable lack brought to the performance a chill air that has
never before been present at a Fitzwilliam presentation. Part of the
reason for the missing rapport between audience and performers was
the lack of the usual communication between these two elements
before or during the concert.

Music may be the universal language, but when supplemented with
a spoken word of friendship it can go so much farther.

Christopher Rowland, violinist and the generally acknowledged
spokesman for the group, must have sensed this same thing for—just
‘before they began the Shostakovich—he rose to address the audience.

“For many of our concerts,” he said, ‘‘there is this barrier. We ar-
rive, dress up in these funny clothes, perform and sneak out the next
day with our suitcases. We have never felt that here and that’s what a
relationship is all about, not having these barriers.”

He thanked the people with whom the four members of the quartet
were staying and Jim Hammerlee—who he called “the ringleader of
the bunch’’—before issuing an invitation to ‘any of you who happen to
be in England” to stop by and see them perform in York.

The group then went on to play the eighth quartet and, after the in-
termission, the lyrical Borodin Quartet No. 1. This quartet is a well-
crafted and finely interwoven piece with delicate intricacies laced
throughout that the Fitzwilliam showed to its fullest advantage.

Rowland’s instrument was still somewhat tinny in the upper
registers and he had a little trouble keeping his strings in tune during
the Borodin, but overall the concert was of the caliber that the local
concert-going public has come to expect from the Quartet. No matter
how it may have started out, the concert still had that special
something that comes from personal contact between the audience
and the performers.

The Sem Gems rehearse outside the Music and Art Building. The group has
been practicing since the beginning of the semester.

Art class pursues imaginative project

If you have been accosted by a
student bearing a tape-recorder
and asking the question, ‘“What
do you feel is the political impact
of art at Bucknell?’’, then you are
part of an innovative project
undertaken by John McCluskey,
lecturer in art, and 19 students in
his Elements of Art class.

The idea came to McCluskey as
way to teach art through the ex-
ploration of its different media
and will be brought to fruition by
the time students leave for
midsemester break.

Each of the students is being
asked to interview between six
and 10 people and to record both
the conversation and the length of
walkway covered during it. This
data will next be translated into
colors and transferred onto an in-
terpretive map of the University
the class has prepared.

The resulting piece of “art”
will serve two major purposes,
McCluskey said. It will provide
the campus with an interesting
exhibit item in the University
Center mall and it will be
a basis for class discussion on the
true essence of art. McCluskey
hopes that the project will pro-
voke students to ask the question,
“What is art?”

McCluskey said art is a per-
sonal experience and thus the
hopes harbored by some for a
universal definition of art can
never be realized.

Art, McCluskey said, must be a
revolt—and dissatisfaction and
creative urge are prerequisites to
creating it. Not that merely by
wanting to do so one can become
an artist, but the talent necessary
can come from the desire to
create, he said.

Of course, he added, there are
people who are talented yet not
artists.

Whether the project taken up
by his class will result in a work
of art or not remains to be seen.
Whatever the final conclusion on
that point, the students—and
perhaps some of the viewers of
their creation — will be left with
their own opinions on the
criterion ofart- --~- "77 "*

® "Sem Gems are singing
after two years’ silence

By AMY KENNEDY

The Sem Gems, female counterparts of
the Bison Chips, have been reorganized
after a two-year absence.

Seniors may remember a group of four
girls called Four on the Floor — or More on
the Floor after the quartet expanded to
eight members — that formed in the fall of

B 1977. Karen Levine ’81, singing lead in the
new group, and Jill Stranko ’81, baritone,
joined together with Kristen Olsen ’81,
tenor, and Melissa Bodine ’81, bass, to at-
tempt the revival of the Sem Gems.

Levine and Stranko, the group’s only
original members, auditioned and were
accepted at the time Four on the Floor
became More on the Floor in the second
semester of their freshman year.

The name Sem Gems followed soon after
and came from an old Bucknell collo-
quialism referring to a time when the
downhill dormitories comprised a
women’s seminary. Sem Gems became
the term commonly used to describe
women living in this wall-enclosed area.

The original Sem Gems consisted of
eight girls who sang together, and with the
Bison Chips, at Tailgate Luncheons and

alumni functions. The demise of the group
came in Levine and Stranko’s sophomore
year, when the other six members of the
octet graduated.

The four seniors who make up the pre-
sent quartet decided it would be “‘fun to get
the old music back together again,” ac-
cording to Levine, and resurrected the
Sem Gems. They will make their debut in
the Homecoming Parade and will be
singing all semester at University func-
tions. Parents’ Weekend they will provide
entertainment for those dining in the
cafeteria.

The Sem Gems have no specific plans to
perform with the Bison Chips as yet, but
are enthusiastic about singing with them
again. There is no competition between the
two groups, according to Levine, rather,
they complement each other.

Auditions for new members will be held
in the spring so that the group will not
dissolve away when the present members
graduate in June. The Sem Gems hope to
teach the “proteges”’ all their music and to
train them in blending their voices. They
are determined to keep up the tradition
this time.

Walker touring Pa.

with one man show

Almost everyone on campus
has watched a travelling per-
former arrive here, unpack his
wares and props from a small
bag seemingly unable to hold all
that comes out of it, present his
modest theatrical or acrobatic
production and continue on his

way.

The thought of where he came
from — or where he might go
next — and why he is doing what
he is sometimes enters the mind,
but it is quickly dispelled by the
hectic class and social schedule.
It never occurs to the casual
observer at the uphill side of the
University Center on a warm day
when a minstrel is here that — on
another campus — a Bucknell
professor may be doing the same
thing.

1980 ‘L’Agenda’ providing

memories, filled with creativity

By KRIS FORSYTHE
The 1980 L’Agenda, ready for distribution this
weekend, is in all respects a welcomed success, pro-
ving that Editor Bill Lorenz 80 and his staff
recovered nicely from the L’Agenda fiasco of 1979 to
produce a well-organized and highly entertaining
yearbook.

Although the preface states that “The ‘Bucknell
Experience’ is difficult to capture in mere words
and pictures,” the 1980 L’Agenda goes on to do just
that. Perhaps one of the nicest touches is the
balance of senior and underclass photos. Unlike
many yearbook candids, no one person is seen on an
inordinate number of pages. There is also a good
representation of both ‘‘Greek” and independent
lifestyles, and the various shots do a good job of il-
lustrating the attraction of these alternatives.

Another commendable aspect of the yearbook is
the extensive coverage of campus events. The arts
section, including Cap and Dagger productions,
student-organized rock groups, Colloquy, concerts
and Celebration of the Arts, receives the attention,
so often missing, worthy of its importance.

Likewise, the activities section includes major
student organizations found on campus, usually ac-
companied by a brief descriptive paragraph about
the individual activity. The senior section contain-
ing the graduation pictures and the faculty section
are both well done and basically complete. These
two sections are not as innovative as other sections,
though their natures do not allow for much expres-
sion of creativity.

The sports section is one of the best to appear in
the L’Agenda. Besides more-than-adequate
coverage of all sporting events, including frisbee,
the section includes high-quality action shots and
complete team composites.

Student life is another outstanding section. By
interspersing events appealing to the entire cam-
pus, such as Greek Weekend, Homecoming ’79,
Halloween and January happenings, the yearbook
staff provides an excellent memoir for all students,
not only the graduates. There are parts geared
especially toward the class of ’80, such as gradua-
tion and the transcript of the speech made by
Michael Cohen and Rob Middlebrook at the Presi-
dent’s Dinner.

In addition to its fine layout and the superb
quality of the photography, the L’Agenda is often
highly original in its creative impulses. A subsec-
tion of student life depicting various glimpses of stu-
dying abroad is one of these imaginative outbursts
and, through illustration of familiar off-campus
scenes, the class of ’80—as well as those ’81, ’82, and
g3—have a pictorial remembrance of those
“special” places that provide often much-needed
escapes from campus.

The artwork throughout the book, especially the
figures on the “‘What’s Happening”’ graphic, is con-
sistently neat and amusing, while the color photos
are extraordinarily well done—the two-page spread
showing the change in seasons in the Academic
Quad is stunning.

The only improvements for the yearbook might
be the listing of team members’ names and the in-
clusion of hall and fraternity/sorority group shots.
Aside from a few minor spelling mistakes and some
white splotches on senior portraits, the book is
technically flawless; excellent layout, no picture
duplication, except for continuity, and no misnamed
graduation pictures.

1980 L’Agenda with complete coverage,
outstanding organization and high-quality photos is
an excellent tribute to the class of 1980.

Yearbook distribution dates are set

Water polo Ist in tournament

By DAVE KIRKPATRICK

“When we control our intensity, there aren’t
many teams we can’t beat,’”’ commented goaltender
Tony Paxton ’81, after the water polo team captured
first place honors in a field of eight teams at the
Slippery Rock Tournament Sunday. Bucknell raised
its record to 7-1 and outscored the opposition 86-15
en route to winning the two-day tournament.

“Fast breaks were definitely the key,” according
to Mark Cori ’81, to the Bisons marching unscathed
through their early tournament opponents.
Bucknell demolished Indiana University (Pa.) 18-1,
Millersburg State, 18-4 and Cornell, 17-2. Bucknell
was so dominant that their starting team played on-
ly the first half against each of these opponents.

In the semi-finals, Bucknell never broke stride,
dispatching Penn State by a convincing 19-2 final.

To fuel their high scoring attack, the Bisons effec-
tively used a counter-attacking offense structured
around the concept of the fast break in basketball
which utilizes the team-speed advantage the Bisons
have over many of their opponents. Scott Shulte ’81
was the high scorer for the Bisons, pumping home
24 goals, while Tom Butler ’82 contributed 15 goals
and 19 assists and senior Mark Gensheimer tallied
11 times in the tournament.

In the finals, the Bisons ran into a fired up Slip-

pery Rock team bent on upsetting awe-inspiring
Bucknell. The first half of the title game featured
tight checking by the Rock, and nervous play from
the Bisons and the halftime score stood at 5-5. Gen-
sheimer ’81 rallied the Bisons in the second half and
when the spray had cleared, Bucknell had a 14-6 vic-
tory as well as the tourney championship.

Gensheimer finished the game with six goals,
while Scott Shulte ’81 added three and Corl and
Butler connected on two apiece.

Two positive developments occurring during the
weekend were the emergence of the counter-attack
and the experience gained by the substitutes, senior
Chris Layton, sophomores Mike Hoffman, John
Simone, Jeff Payne, Dan Goss and Dave Ferguson,
and freshman Scott Mutschler. All received exten-
sive playing time and valuable game experience.

The Bisons play in the Mid-Atlantic League Tour-
nament at Cornell Saturday and Sunday, where
they will face much of the same competition they
handled with such ease last weekend. The contests
count toward league standings, which eventually
decide the qualifiers for the Eastern Champion-
ships. The Bisons’ only home tournament is Oct. 17,
where the competition will include the New York
Athletic Club, a perennial Eastern power and rival
‘of the Bisons.

Gridder offense stalls in 21-13 loss to Davidson

By STEVEN SKOLNICK and
MICHAEL SUAREZ

After the Bisons’ poor per-
formance in losing 21-13 to David-
son Saturday, Head Coach Bob
Curtis remarked, “It was a
pressure packed game _ that
should have been a win for us. We
didn’t execute; we didn’t win.”

The afternoon started quite dif-
ferently, however, as the Herd
dominated in the early going.

After halting the Wildcats on
their first series, the Bisons
drove 55 yards in six plays for the
opening score. An 18-yard
touchdown pass from quarter-
back Al Locey ’83 to freshman
split end Dave Kucera had the
Bisons on the board with just 4:35
gone in the first quarter. Junior
Bill Grennon’s conversion was no
good, a mistake which eventually
became ‘‘super critical’ ac-
cording to Curtis.

The Wildcats were able to gain
only 20 yards on their next
possession and the Herd offense
began their subsequent drive
from their own 32.

It'only took eight plays for the
Bisons to hit paydirt a second
time. An 18-yard strike from
Locey to tight end Rich Passerot-
ti ’82, followed two plays later by
a Locey touchdown toss to Ken
Jenkins ’82, highlighted the drive.
This time, Grennon split the posts
to give the Herd a 13-0 lead.

The second quarter began
more ominously for the Herd as
Grennon’s 49-yard field goal at-
tempt fell just a few feet short of
the crossbar.

Four minutes later Locey
threw the first of three intercep-
tions he gave up during the after-
noon.

The Wildcats then put together
their only scoring drive of the
first half, amassing 48 yards in
eight plays. An 18-yard screen
pass and 20-yard draw up the
middle did most of the damage.

When Jenkins was stripped of
the ball by a Davidson defender
on the next Herd series, the
Wildcats had excellent field posi-
tion on their own 48-yard line.

However, a Doug Smoot ’82 in-
terception in his own endzone
stopped the Wildcat drive in the
closing seconds of the half and
sent the Herd to the locker room
with its six-point lead intact.

The third quarter began slowly
as neither team was able to gain
a first down. Midway through the
quarter, Davidson marched 55
yards in nine plays to tie the
score. The point after touchdown
was good and the Bisons found
themselves behind by a 14-13
score. The conversion missed
earlier sat heavily in the Bisons’
minds.

Jenkins returned the Davidson

called Sinclair ‘“‘the best back

kickoff 34 yards and ‘almost
broke it for a touchdown,” Curtis
said.

Just two plays later Locey
fumbled a bad snap from center
and the Wildcats recovered on
the Bucknell 34-yard line.

On the third play of the Wildcat
series, Smoot pulled down his
second interception of the after-
noon, by making what Curtis
called ‘‘a super defensive play.”
Smoot is tied for second in the
ECAC division I-AA with four in-
terceptions in as many games.

An incredible series of ex-
changes followed with two Locey
passes being intercepted with
McKinley Norris ’81 stealing one
back for the Bisons in between.
The second Locey interception
was a “‘badly underthrown ball,”’
that would have been ‘‘a sure
touchdown if it had been on the
mark,” stated Curtis.

Davidson had little trouble
scoring its third touchdown mid-
way through the fourth quarter,
as they used 11 plays to drive 38
yards for the final score.

The Bisons’ final two drives
ended in failure, indicative of an
offensive performance which net-
ted only three first downs in the
second half and 12 for the game.

Overall, the Bison defense

Lafayette invades on Saturday

By STEVEN SKOLNICK
and MICHAEL SUAREZ

The Bisons return to Memorial Stadium Saturday
to face Lafayette in the 58th renewal of Bucknell’s
oldest rivalry. The Homecoming contest kicks off at
1:30 pm.

With a 1-3 record, the Leopards’ offense has been
struggling. All their touchdowns for the season
came during their only win, a 27-20 decision over
Davidson on Sept. 20. Lafayette has lost to Maine,
Columbia and Central Connecticut.

Head Coach Neil Putnam’s charges utilize a new-
ly modified wing T formation on offense. Tailback

Ed Rogusky and fullback Roger Curylo are the
leading rushers, averaging four yards per carry
apiece. Splitting the quarterbacking chores will be
Mark Lenchmanck and Hal Hocking. Split end Jim
Flanagan leads the receiving corps with 12 catches
for 155 yards over four games.

Injuries may hamper the Herd’s effort to gain
their third victory as starting inside linebackers
Alvin Depew ’81 and Pat Paro ’82 will both be
unavailable for action. Left tackle John Boehmer is
still out, while right guard Al Wehrhahn ’81 is listed
as questionable for the contest.

played well, limiting the Wildcat
offense, which averaged over 500
yards and 39 points per game to
just 263 yards and 21 points. The
Wildcats’ outstanding fullback
Ray Sinclair accounted for most
of the Davidson offense, gaining
140 yards in 31 carries. Curtis

we’ve seen in some time.”’

In the final analysis, the Bison
offense couldn’t come through
when it had to. Curtis summar-
ized, ‘‘when the pressure was ap-
plied, we didn’t have the maturi-
ty to put it all together.”

record to 0-5.

Friday, October 10, 1980

The Nittany Lions “totally
dominated the game,” said coach
Pete Puccia ’81, who added, “We
were beaten soundly in every
aspect.” Penn State players
receive athletic scholarships and
are one of the top five squads in
the country, according to Puccia.
Goaltender Jean Schoenlank ’84
was “outstanding,” Puccia said,
in making 21 saves against the
Nittany Lion onslaught.

Bear Bryant wins
300th career game

Three football coaching
milestones were reached Satur-
day during NCAA action.

Paul ‘Bear’ Bryant reached
the 300-victory plateau as
Alabama crushed Kentucky 45-0.
Bryant trails only Amos Alonzo
Stagg, with 314 coaching trium-
phs, and Pop Warner, with 313.
Bryant has a 35-year combined
record of 300-77-16.

The Crimson Tide led Kentucky
only 14-0 at the half, but scored
three touchdowns in a span of 2
minutes, 20 seconds in the fourth
quarter to pull away. Halfback
Linnie Patrick was the sparkplug
in setting up touchdowns with
runs of 60 and 38 yards and also
scoring on a 1-yard dive.

Alabama has won 25 con-
secutive games and is in quest of
an unprecedented third straight
national championship. The
Crimson Tide is ranked first in
both AP and UPI polls with a
perfect 4-0 record. Second ranked
Southern California has won 23

one more win to capture their

York 3-2 Thursday and 7-2
Wednesday to gain a 2-0 series

A two-run triple by Willie

Willie Randolph was thrown out
at the plate by a Wilson to George
Brett to Darrel Porter relay.

Lary Gura survived 10 New

Astros, Phillies tied

Houston defeated Philadelphia
7-4 in 10 innings Wednesday night
to even their playoff series at one

Dave Bergman’s two run triple

Andujar then induced Mike
Schmidt, the home run champion
of the major leagues, to fly out on
a 3-and-0 pitch to end the Phillies’
threat in the bottom of the inning.
Philadelphia wasted 14 hits in the
loss.

The Phillies captured game one
3-1 as 24-game winner Steve
Carlton and ace reliever Tug
McGraw limited the Astros to
seven hits. Greg Luzinski sup-
plied the decisive runs with a
seventh-inning home run with
Pete Rose on base. The win was

Volleyball team finds winning
formula with pair of victories

By JEFF CROSS

The volleyball team gave
strong performances in winning
two consecutive matches this
week to raise their record to 3-7.
The spikers bested
Elizabethtown, 3-0, and Lock
Haven, 3-1, after bowing to York,
3-1.

In blanking Elizabethtown
Wednesday, the Bisons
“completely out-hustled” their
opponents, according to coach
Terrie Grieb, by winning 15-5,15-
11, 15-6. She added, ‘‘They had a
lot of height but when you’re that
big, you just can’t move.”

Grieb cited Jeanne Groeneveld
’83 as “‘the all-around best player
with her spikes and net play’’ and
Carolyn Weeks ’82, who ‘“‘had the
best game she’s had yet. Her
serve reception was outstan-

Women’s X-country wins first

By BRIAN FETTERHOFF
By placing five runners in the top 10 places, the
women’s cross country team outraced both
Bloomsburg and Lock Haven to win the Mansfield
Invitational meet Saturday. The Bisons edged
Bloomsburg, 27-29, while out-distancing Lock
Haven, 20-41.

Lock Haven’s Vickie Smith captured first place in
21:09, with Lauren Meymaris of Bloomsburg second
in 21:21. Jo Burrell ’83 was the top Bucknell finisher,
placing third in 21:40, while Laura Gaydos ’83 was
right behind in 21:44. Judy Olson ’84 managed a
sixth place finish (21:47), with Julie Crossman ’83
ninth (22:15), and Karen Flanagan ’84 10th (22:18).

On Sept. 27, the Bucknell ‘A’ squad placed fifth in
a 15 team field at the Indiana (Pa.) Invitational
meet. Host Indiana University captured first place
with 60 points, just edging out Slippery Rock (64
points) and Army (65 points). The Bucknell ‘A’
team managed a 149 total while the Bucknell ‘B’

squad finished eighth with a 274 score.

Kathy Warlow of West Virginia University ‘A’
completed the 3.1 mile course first in 18:43. Juniata
Vetter of Slippery Rock and Sheila Fleming of In-
diana ‘A’ were the only other runners to break 19

18:59, respectively.

ding.’”’ The coach also praised
captain Susan Bairstow ’81, for a
great serving game, as well as
Katie Eckert ’84, for her powerful
spikes and fine net play.

The Bisons defeated Lock
Haven in a road match Monday,
15-6, 9-15, 15-8, 16-14. Grieb was
pleased with the team’s improv-
ed serving and serve reception,
but added, ‘‘We still do not have
the killer instinct.”

Katie Hale ’83 “had the best
game in her Bucknell career,”
against the Eagles, commented
the coach. Bairstow, Eckert and
Susan Atkinson ’81 ‘‘dominated
the net, blocking a lot of spikes,”

stated Grieb, while Nina Kamin-
sky ’81 made outstanding sets.

The spikers lost a home en-
counter with York Saturday, fall-
ing 9-15, 15-4, 14-16, 7-15. The
Bisons led 9-0 in the first game
and 12-2 in the second but lost
both leads because ‘“‘We were not
aggressive at all,’ remarked
Grieb.

The Bison junior varsity rallied
to beat Lock Haven Monday, 11-
15, 15-12, 15-0, behind the ex-
cellent play of Denise Cohen ’83.

6-1 in first singles. Sarah Krieger
’83 defeated Jane Kaufman, 6-1,
6-4, and Kirsten Schubauer ’81
topped Debbie Orendoerff, 6-0,
6-3, in second and third singles
respectively.

Cindy Appel ’83 edged Ellen
Williams, 6-4, 6-4, but
Bloomsburg avoided a shutout
when Debbie Gundrum squeezed
by Janis Huber ’81, 7-6, 7-6. Laura
Kirschstein ’84 captured the sixth
singles slot with a close 6-4, 7-5
win over Linda Becker.

The Bisons swept the doubles,
as Krieger and Huber defeated
Hnatin and Williams, 6-3, 6-3,
Koch and Appel rallied to top
Kaufman and Orendoerff, 6-3, 3-6,
6-3 and Schubauer and Kirsch-
stein put away Gundrum and
Becker, 6-2, 6-3.

Co-captain Huber is pleased
with the team’s progress, stating,

“This is our toughest schedule
ever, but I’m really pleased
we’ve only lost one match.” She
added, ‘‘We have a lot of depth
and can usually pull through a lot

of matches in our doubles.”

SPORTS VIEWPOINT

NHL forecast: six top challengers

By JEFF CROSS

Though baseball is on every-
one’s mind and football has
begun, the National Hockey
League begins action this week
with 20 teams trying to unseat the
New York Islanders as league
champions. I offer my predic-
tions for the top teams for the up-
coming season.

Although repeating as cham-
pions is always more difficult
than winning the first title, the
Islanders have the ingredients to
capture a second Stanley Cup
crown. They still have steady
goaltending, a solid defense and
depth at the forward positions.

Dennis Potvin, Bryan Trottier

and Mike Bossy are the names in
the spotlight, but the rugged
players like Bob Nystrom, Clark
Gillies and Bob Lorimer make
the Islanders tough to beat.

Montreal, Stanley Cup cham-
pions from 1976 to 1979, is anxious
to regain a position in the finals
after being eliminated in the
quarterfinals last year. With
abundant talent at both forward
and defensive positions, only in-
juries and suspect goaltending
will prevent the Canadiens from
challenging the Islanders for top
laurels.

Buffalo boasts the Vezina
Trophy-winning goaltending duo
of Don Edwards and Bob Sauve,

one of the top defenses in the
league and a potent scoring at-
tack. The Sabres finished second
in the overall points standings
last year under the magic of Scot-
ty Bowman as general manager.
They need only more aggressive-
ness to make a serious run for the
title.

Philadelphia lost in the finals
last year after winning the
regular-season points race. The
Flyers, who are packed with hard
workers, feature a potent offense,
stingy goaltending and the in-
spirational leadership of Bobby
Clarke. Only an unsteady defen-
sive crew will keep the Flyers
from championship contention.

Boston, with new coach Gerry
Cheevers, has a strong defense
led by Ray Borque, last year’s
rookie of the year, and Brad
Park. The Bruins are loaded with
scrappers, but age may have
caught up with Jean Ratelle and
Don Marcotte, among others. The
goaltending of Rogie Vachon—
who is attempting to regain his
old form—and the untested Jim
Craig will determine how high
Boston finishes.

Minnesota, a very young
squad, was the surprise of the
NHL last year by reaching the
semifinals after knocking off
Montreal. A potent offense and
solid goaltending give the North
Stars bright hope for the coming
season.

Mudsharks finish 2nd to UVa

By DAN PICARDI

The men’s ultimate frisbee
team finished second in a field of
six teams in a round-robin tour-
nament at Bucknell last
weekend, losing only to the
University of Virginia by a 15-12
decision in the finals. The Mud-

sharks defeated Penn State and
the Lycoming, Hershey, and
Washington D.C. frisbee clubs to
reach the championship.

In the first contest, the Mud-
sharks totally outclassed Penn
State in winning 13-4. Bucknell
defeated Penn State 19-5 four

weeks ago.

The Mudsharks’ second match,
against Washington D.C. was
much tougher. Down 11-6 at one
point the ’Sharks reeled off nine
unanswered goals capitalizing on
turnovers to win 15-12.

Saturday’s final game saw the
Mudsharks demolish the Hershey
frisbee club by a 26-10 verdict.

Sunday Bucknell captured its
fourth match to gain the finals by
defeating Lycoming 23-8.

The finals against the Universi-
ty of Virginia, the only other
undefeated team, proved to be
the most exciting match of the
weekend. The Mudsharks got off
to a shaky start, but managed to
stay close. With five minutes left
in the game the ’Sharks closed to
within a goal, but then their pass-
ing game broke down and turn-
overs were converted into
Virginia goals, leaving the final
score 15-12.

final game,”’ said team member
Peter Maier ’81, adding “‘overall
the team worked well together.”

Hockey splits pair of games

By JAN BALAKIAN

LaSalle trounced the varsity
field hockey team 5-0 Saturday,
just two days after the Bisons
captured their second con-
secutive match with a 40
whitewash at home against Sus-
quehanna.

LaSalle’s ‘‘exceptional per-
formance,” combined with the
Bisons’ ‘‘inability to move to and
keep possession of the ball,” were
the deciding factors, according to
coach Sally Starr. The Explorers
defeated the Bisons only 3-2 last
season, but ‘‘They fired too many
strong shots from too close in”
that could only have been stopped
by “miraculous saves” on the
part of goalie Betsy Doyle "82, ac-
cording to Starr.

LaSalle jumped to a quick
start, scoring after one and one
half minutes had elapsed and led
4-0 by halftime. Starr remarked,
“The ease with which they scored
the first goal caught our kids off
balance.”

Starr complimented the Bisons
on their persistence, noting, “We
could easily have given up in the
second half”’ but, ‘‘we got the ball
a lot more on attack and had a
few more scoring corners.” The
game was actually closer than
the final score indicated, as both
teams are ‘equally talented,”
Starr said. The loss dropped the
Bisons’ record to 2-4.

The Bisons overwhelmed Sus-
quehanna Oct. 2 for their biggest
victory margin of the season.

Freshmen Nancy Dill and Sue
Lenker, nicknamed ‘“‘The Jet
Set” by Starr because of their
speed, scored the first two goals.
Chrissy King ’82 and Maria Pro-
copio ’83 tallied the the second
and third goals, respectively.
Starr calls King, ‘‘The cor-
nerstone of our attack,” while be-

stability tor the front line.’’ Pro-
copio, a substitute, “has been
playing better and better every
game,” commented Starr.

The division III Crusaders
““worked hard to get the ball back
but lacked the skill to complete
their plays,” added Starr.

Starr looks for goaltender
Doyle to lead the Bisons to a
strong finish, stating, ‘“Betsy can
be the spark as soon as she gets
her composure back because she
is mentally and _ physically

ge. ee

strong.’’ The team can “‘do well if
we have mental discipline and
confidence,’’ she added.

Bucknell hosts Lafayette Satur-
day at 11 a.m. and Centre Coun-
try Club Sunday and 11:30 a.m.
The Leopards tied the Bisons 2-2
last season and sport a 2-4 record
this year. The squad has not
played Centre Court before this
season.

Starr concluded, ‘If we are to
think of playing any post season
hockey, we must act now.”’

Cross country outraces
3 foes; record is 6-0

By JEFF CROSS
With the first five runners
establishing a collective record
time and by placing nine racers
among the first 11 finishers, the
men’s cross country team ex-
tended its winning steak to 70

straight opponents Saturday. The
Orange and Blue swept the
quadrangular meet by
stampeding over St. Joseph’s, 19-
44, Lehigh, 15-50, and Temple, 15-
50.

Bill Reifsnyder ‘84 (right) and Hulme finished first and third,
respectively, in the Bisons’ sweep of Saturday's cross country

Trace of the season by setting a
freshman mark of 25:16 over the
5.15 mile course. Reifsnyder’s
time is the fifth fastest ever
registered on the home course.

St. Joseph’s Jim VanBlunk
avoided a complete Bison shut
out by placing second in 25:24.
However, Bucknell took third
through seventh places to com-
plete the rout.

Mark Hulme ’83 placed third in
25:27, the ninth best time ever on
the course by a Bucknell runner.
Jeff Hines ’84 took fourth in 25:30,
while Mike DeBraggio ’81 was
right behind in 25:33.

Jim O’Shea completed the
Bisons’ scoring by placing sixth
in 25:41, barely nosing out Glenn
Gibney ’83, who had the identical
time. Steve Biggotto continued
his string of impressive per-
formances by winning the eighth
position in 25:47, while Pat
O’Connor ’84 closed out the top
ten in 25:48.

Soccer team stumbles to
Penn State and Rutgers

By BOB DAVIS

The soccer team dropped a pair of
games this week to lower their record to 2-
3-1. The booters fell 3-1 to Rutgers Satur-
day and 5-1 to Penn State Tuesday.

Penn State, ranked seventh in the na-
tion, played to expectations in dispatching
the Bisons at State College. The Nittany
Lions sport a 7-1 record, with their only
loss coming against fifth-ranked Indiana.

Despite good ball movement in the first
half against Penn State, the Bisons faced a
4-0 halftime deficit. Coach Craig Reynolds
commented, ‘‘Penn State worked well out-
side and rifled the ball across’’ to constant-
ly threaten.

Pete Jobling began the scoring for the
Nittany Lions at 11:10 of the first half,

blasting a shot by goaltender Pete Puccia
81.

The Lions’ second goal was the result of
poor defensive play on the part of the
Bisons, whose failure to clear the ball from
the goal area allowed Lion Jeff Maierhofer
to head a crossing pass behind Puccia.
Dan Murphy and Steve Blumenthal tallied
the remaining goals of the half for Penn
State.

The fifth and final Lion score came with §

six minutes gone in the second half off the
foot of Doug Moyer.

The Bisons were able to keep Penn State
from any further scoring, eventually get-
ting on the board themselves. The lone
Bison marker was scored unassisted by
sophomore midfielder Mark Brotherton

with 6:34 remaining, his fourth of the year,
to cut the Nittany Lions’ lead to 5-1. But it
was simply a case of too little, too late.

Still, Reynolds praised his team’s effort,
noting ‘‘We moved the ball well and never
gave up. I can’t be unhappy about our per-
formance.” Puccia commented, “Penn
State had exceptional shots and they
finished their plays miraculously.” He ad-
ded, “If we had played this well all season,
we'd have been 5-0 up to this point.””

After Saturday’s 3-1 loss to Rutgers,
Reynolds stated, ‘‘We were terrible fun-
damentally—we made so many unforced
errors. They didn’t have all that much
pressure on us.”’

The Scarlet Knights scored at 4:25 on a
goal by Ramiro Borja that was actually a
miskick. According to Reynolds, ‘‘He was
trying to cross it, but it sailed high into the
corner.”

The Bisons proceeded to play uninspired
soccer for most of the remainder of the
game. ‘‘They scored early and knocked the
incentive out of us,” noted Reynolds, ad-
ding “‘It’s a weak sign if we quit after one
goal.”

Peter Csirmaz made the score 2-0 mid-
way through the first half by taking ad-
vantage of some Bison defensive errors to
direct a header past Puccia.

The Scarlet Knights picked up their third
goal at 22:38 of the second half following a
penalty called against Puccia, who fouled
a Rutgers player after making a save. Bor-
ja promptly banged home the ensuing
penalty shot for his second tally of the
afternoon.

With about 10 minutes remaining, the
Knights’ Roland Mitchell was ejected for
throwing a punch at Brotherton, and the
Bisons’ only score followed shortly after-
wards. Freshman Peter Mullany passed to
the left side where Steve Goldenring ’83
controlled the ball and volleyed it in from
11 yards out.

“We were down 3-0 and that’s when we
started to play,” said Reynolds. “I had
good vibes going in, but you're going to
have your off days.”

The Bisons host Bloomsburg Friday
night at 7:00 p.m. and play the annual
Alumni game Saturday at 4:00 p.m.

Committee proposes writing program;

75% of students deficient in skulls

By JEFF CROSSLAND

A proposal calling for major revisions in the
teaching of writing at the University has been sent
to department chairmen by a subcommittee of the
University Committee on Instruction.

The 16-page writing program proposal says all
students in both the College of Arts and Sciences
and the College of Engineering should be required
to take three courses in writing before graduating.

A basic writing course and a writing emphasis
course would be required of students in the
freshman and sophomore year, and an advanced
course — probably related to the major — would be
required in either the junior or senior year.

A principal change that would result if the pro-
gram proposal is ever passed by the full faculty
would be that the responsibility for the teaching of
writing would no longer be placed solely on the
English department’s freshman course offerings.

The subcommittee report said all departments
should offer courses with an emphasis on writing.

There are reasons for concern about the writing
ability of students here. According to the sub-
committee’s report, ‘‘some students cannot use the
medium of language effectively in its written form.

“Three areas of evidence suggest that significant
numbers of students lack the appropriate writing
skills: the University admissions profile, the
number of entering students requiring special
tutorial assistance, and faculty opinion,” the report
said.

Two surveys, one conducted in November and the
other in February, asked faculty members “How
adequate are the writing skills of your students?”
The faculty response for freshmen and sophomores
indicated “about 25 percent are accomplished for
most purposes. Maybe another 50 percent are more

Prison’s NAACP is disciplined

CLIFFORD KINNEY

By LYNNE RUTHERFORD

Prison authorities have denied
the Lewisburg Federal Prison’s
inmate chapter of the National
Association for the Advancement
of Colored People access to out-
side association members for six
months. The chapter’s inmate
members may hold meetings
among themselves during that
time, however.

The Sept. 8 action of Warden J.
Petrovsky has resulted in a series
of repercussions from the
Lewisburg Prison Project and
the Bureau of Prisons in
Washington. The Lewisburg
branch was founded eight years
ago as the first prison based
N.A.A.C.P. chapter in the nation.

The action was taken because
the N.A.A.C.P. was interfering
with and setting goals for the
chapter, and refusing to let the in-

mates ‘do their own thing,” ac-
cording to Clifford Kinney, ex-
ecutive assistant to the warden.
Prison officials have refused to
cite specific incidents of
N.A.A.C.P. interference.

Outside interference with an in-
mate group is in violation of the
prison’s policy that all inmate
groups be self-governing.

Leroy Mobley, national
director of the N.A.A.C.P. prison
program, said the charges were
“Judicrous” and had “no basis in
fact.”

Neither Petrovsky nor the in-
mate president of the chapter
could be reached for comment.

Mobley charged that the
restriction was arbitrary and
discriminatory, and that prison
officials are unsympathetic to the
needs of black inmates. The

Students battle with
Coder over fund use

ABS petitions University on fund control

By S.A. HABETZ

The Association of Bucknell
Students has voted to petition the
University Committee on Com-
plimentary Activities to deter-
mine who has legitimate control
of funds generated by the
Bucknell Recycling Club.

Bob Doms ’81, President of the
recycling club, proposed the peti-
tion before the ABS Congress
Monday night.

The approved statement reads:
“the ABS petitions the University
Committee on Complimentary
Activities to review the policy
concerning the Recycling
Group’s funds and the future use
of those funds and determine who
has legitimate control of the
funds generated by the Bucknell
Recycling Group. These funds,
totaling $4,633, are currently
under the control of Professor
Charles Coder, the group’s ex-
advisor.”

Professor of Engineering
Charles Coder has retained con-
trol of the Recycling Club’s bank
accuunt although he has resigned
as the group’s advisor.

Coder said the original intent of
the Recycling Club was to use the
money for a scholarship fund for
area high school students.

Doms said it was Coder’s
“original intention to use the
money for a scholarship fund, not
the club’s.””

“The club’s intentions,’”’ ac-
cording to Doms, ‘‘were, and are,
to expand the program, using
funds to buy equipment and
materials deemed necessary and
beneficial for the program and to
pledge money to support the pro-
duction of the Bucknell En-
vironmental News.””

“The third and lowest priori-
ty,”’ Doms said, “was listed as
scholarship and/or other alter-
natives.”

Dunlop said last week that the
ABS could petition for a “review
of policy,” for the Recycling
Club. The review, he said, would
determine whether the present
members of the club are allowed
to control its funds.

“We would rather not engage in
a review,” Dunlop said then.
“We're not sure what kind of ef-
fect that will have on other
clubs.”

The petition was originally
directed to Dean of Student Af-
fairs John Dunlop and Vice Presi-
dent of Administration and
Finance John Zeller. Dunlop, who
also serves as ABS advisor, ob-
jected to this. ‘Such a precedent
could lead to the administration
having to serve as mediator in
the internal difficulties of all stu-
dent groups at Bucknell,” he
said.

The ABS Congress agreed with

Student food thief strikes mods;

University is‘to solve problem’

By MATT KARANIAN

The student responsible for a recent rash of food
thefts from the Bucknell West mods has been iden-
tified, according to Vice President for Administra-
tion and Finance John Zeller.

Zeller said he would not reveal the name of the
student responsible, but said the University is work-
ing ‘“‘to solve the problem.”

In recent weeks, thefts of food items have oc-
curred repeatedly in the mods, according to John
Dzurinko ’81, a resident of the solar mod.

According to a complaint filed with campus
security and with East Buffalo township police by
Kimbra Swigart ’81, “unknown person or persons
did remove 2 boxes of cereal and one half gallon of
milk” from her kitchen in mod 23 between midnight
and 9 a.m. Sept. 5.

Swigart reported she locked both doors of the mod
before going to bed, and said she awoke the next
morning to find one door open, and the food missing
from the kitchen.

Keith Rozolis ’81 filed a similar complaint less
than one week later. He complained in a report to
campus security and to East Buffalo police that

“unknown person or persons removed cookies,
assorted cheeses, apple crumb cake, fudge cookies,
and sliced ham” from his mod 6 kitchen between
12:30 and 1:30 a.m. on Sept. 11.

According to Assistant Dean of Student Affairs
Joseph Mammola, these are the only recorded in-
stances of food thefts at Bucknell West this se-
mester. Mammola was not aware that Zeller had
identified the person responsible for the thefts.
Mammola said he had no leads or suspects in the
case. He said, however, the person might be a “bold
and domineering”’ type.

Dzurinko said there were several other incidents,
but they have not been reported to police.

Zeller refused to speculate upon any motives a
student might have for stealing food from student
kitchens. He refused to identify the student or ex-
plain what, if any, action will be taken against the
person.

The physical plant is in the process of changing
locks on doors in the mods now, but Zeller “‘couldn’t
say” when he expected the work to be completed.
“Tt may take a little time,” he said, refusing to
speculate on a date.

Campus leaders convene for meeting;
students urged to honor recess dates

ABS President John Dzurinko ’81 expressed con-
cern at Wednesday’s roundtable discussion that
students will disregard the dates of midsemester
break and either leave school early or return late.

“The midsemester break is experimental, and
professors will be checking attendance,” Dzurinko
said. The other student leaders should publicize —
through their organizations — the importance of
class attendance up to Oct. 24 and prompt return at
8 a.m. Oct. 29, he said.

Dzurinko said students should keep in mind that
the break was instituted to ‘‘rectify the severe
shortcomings of the fall semester calendar” and as
such should be respected.

The meeting was the third of student organization
leaders, who began a series of discussions at
Dzurinko’s urging to coordinate their groups ahd

.plan activities. The meetings are held weekly dur-

ing dinner in the Concern and Action office.

Present at this week’s meeting were Dzurinko,
WVBU-FM Program Director Jay Cresswell ’81,
Bucknell Engineer Editor David Christiansen ’81,
Concern and Action President Steven Kushner ’82,
Women’s Concern Group Chairperson Lynne
Rutherford ’82 and Christian Fellowship President
Keith Brown ’81.

Dzurinko again expressed what he saw as a
“need” for campus leaders to receive course credit
for their work. He said student leaders should find a
sponsor within individual departments, namely
English credit for Bucknellian section editors and

sociology credit for Concern and Action organizers.

The ABS president also suggested that the leaders,
consult with members of their organizations and
submit ideas on new, “socially oriented courses and
seminars” to be added to the University catalogue.
Such courses and seminars would serve to draw the
student body and Lewisburg closer together, he
said.

The ABS has already begun one such program in
its sponsorship of student attendance during local
town meetings.

The success of Christy’s Gate was noted, with
Concern and Action President Kushner reporting
that the next appearance of the cafe will be in early
November. A further non-alcoholic alternative was
proposed in the form of a dance in the Bison, to be
scheduled following the break.

Dzurinko expressed sympathy for the Women’s
Concern Group’s petition protesting the lack of a
female gynecologist on campus first semester. The
petition is being circulated now and will be submit-
ted to John Dunlop, Dean of Student Affairs, in the
near future.

During the next few weeks the student leaders
will address ABS meetings on the topic of student
activities. As poor attendance marked the meeting,
the fitting topic of their talks will be the difficulties
of organizing student groups under the pressure of
academics.

Teamsters struggle for support; to hold meeting soon

By MATT KARANIAN

The Teamsters will sponsor an organiza-
tional meeting for non-professional
employees here ‘‘in the near future’ to
solicit support for its unionization efforts,
according to Alfred Byrd, secretary-
treasurer and business representative of
the local.

Byrd hopes non-professional employees
in his target group of Physical Plant and
dining service workers will support the
Teamsters as their collective bargaining
agent. He said there are ‘‘a lot of people in-
terested” in unionizing, but he refused to
cite specific numbers.

Some employees have signed cards
pledging support of the Teamsters, Byrd
said, but he would not say how many cards
he received, either.

He said he does not want the University
to find out.

If one-third of the employees in the pro-
posed target group for the union sign the

pledge cards, the Teamsters will be allow-
ed to put the unionization issue up to elec-
tion.

The American Federation of State,
County, and Municipal Employees
(AFSCME) has also been seeking to
unionize the same group of uon-
professionals here.

William Fogle, staff representative for
AFSCME, said he is not making any ef-
forts to unionize the Physical Plant and
dining service workers now, however.

“The interest isn’t that great. It’s just a
trickle,” Fogle said. AFSCME had been
working to gain the support of employees
here since 1978. Fogle successfully peti-
tioned the National Labor Relations Board
for permission to hold an election on the
issue, but AFSCME lost in the referendum.

“Non-professionals voted 3-1 against en-
dorsing AFSCME as their collective
bargaining agent in April 1979.

Despite Fogle’s failure to draw support
for AFSCME, Byrd does not think the
Teamster’s efforts here will be ‘“‘necessari-
ly futile.” Byrd said the Teamsters have
organized ‘‘many times where others have

_ tried and failed.”

Citing Teamster sucéesses with organiz-
ing employees at Penn State University
and at the University of Pennsylvania,
Byrd said there is ‘‘always a possibility”
for organization.

“Some employees don’t think they’ve
had fair cost of living increases. We are
not the judge and jury of whether people
are getting enough (wages and benefits).
We just try to help them get what they
want,” Byrd said.

The Teamsters and AFSCME are
separate and distinct unions, and their ac-

tions to organize non-protessionals are not
coordinated. Byrd said he did not know if
AFSCME was “even trying or not.” He’
said any actions AFSCME takes would not
influence the Teamsters.

Fogle said, however, that actions the
Teamsters take would influence
AFSCME’s efforts. ‘I’m just waiting to
see what the Teamsters come up with,” he
said. “If they petition for an election, I’m
going to try to get on the ballot.”

Although employee cards pledging sup-
port of the union are required from one-
third of the employees in a target group in
order to force an election, a collective
bargaining agent needs to collect pledge
cards from only 3 percent of the members
in the target group to get its name added to
the ballot, Fogle said.

Fogle expects to have pledge cards from
3 percent of the non-professionals in the
target group.

Prison’s NAACP activity restricted

From NAACP, page 1

Lewisburg Prison is comprised of
70 percent racial minorities.

Petrovsky first informed the
N.A.A.C.P. of his decision to
restrict visitors in a Sept. 8 letter
to Connie Craig, the association’s
Pennsylvania state coordinator
of prison programs.

Craig then informed the New
York based N.A.A.C.P. office,
which telegrammed back a re-
quest for an emergency meeting
with prison and N.A.A.C.P. of-
ficials, as well as some Penn-
sylvania state senators and local

congressmen.

Petrovsky denied this request,
and Mobley said he will take the
matter to the Bureau of Prisons
in Washington for review.

Mobley founded the first
N.A.A.C.P. chapter in 1972 when
he was an inmate in Lewisburg.
It now numbers over 250 mem-
bers and has served as a role
model for 400 other prison
chapters across the country.
Mobley cited his status as an ex-
inmate as another possible
reason for being denied access to
the chapter.

In addition to contacting the
N.A.A.C.P., Craig said he has
kept the Lewisburg Prison
Project (LPP) abreast of
developments during the incident
and has requested their support.

“The LPP is precently working
in concert with the national office
of the N.A.A.C.P. If they ask us to
do something, we’ll do it. We are
supportive of them in every
respect,” according to Toni Byrd,
executive director of the LPP.
The prison project is a non-profit
organization which was founded
seven years ago to safeguard
inmate’s rights.

“The prison officials were
getting worried that the chapter
was gaining too much support
from inmates and fostering
brotherhood among them. The
restrictions were made for

~ security reasons,” Byrd said.

There really wasn’t much choice
in Women’s rings. But no more.

different fashion designs

“This is another example of
prison officials trying to cut in-
mate’s off from the outside
world,” Byrd said.

Both Mobley and the LPP
pledged to keep trying to rein-

state the inmate’s previous
contacts with the N.A.A.C.P.

The N.A.A.C.P.
acted no different from any other
group. We have always helped
run the prison chapter’s
meetings. That’s what we’re sup-
posed to do,” said Mobley.

“Petrovsky and Kinney don’t
know anything about the chapter

and don’t understand its function.
The only dealings the group has
ever had. are with the activities

Kinney said if the chapter is
found to be in compliance with
prison regulations by next month,
it will regain its privileges of
access to outside association
members.

Writing proposal made
by University Committee

From WRITING, page 1

or less incompetent — some
inadequacies. About 15 percent
have more serious problems and
some 10 percent qualify as essen-
tially illiterate.” The report said
the proposals offered should be
instituted on an experimental
basis for the next two years.

The six-member subcommittee,
chaired by Assistant Professor of
English Catherine Smith, releas-
ed the report to the faculty for
consideration Sept. 10 after a
series of sessions this summer to
draft the proposal.

A program for the cgmprehen-
sive revision and improvement
the teaching of writing — and the
improvement of writing skills by
students here — was first submit-
ted to the full Instruction Com-
mittee by Smith in March. After
reviewing the Smith proposal for
two months, the Instruction Com-
mittee created the subcommittee
— with Smith as chairman — “‘to
explore possibilities of expanded
writing instruction at Bucknell
and to develop models for
teaching models in the
disciplines.”

No consensus could be reached
on the original Smith proposal by
the full committee, although the
group unanimously agreed that
revision in the University’s pre-
sent writing program was need-
ed, according to the committee’s
published minutes.

The committee also feared the
original proposal would not pass
the vote of the full faculty, the
minutes said.

While faculty participation in
offering these courses would be
voluntary, the report said that in-
terested faculty should be helped
to institute the writing program
through the establishment of
workshops in the teaching of
writing.

Each department chairman is
expected to solicit opinions from
department members within the
next week. Provost Wendell
Smith will hold a meeting with
chairmen Thursday to discuss
the proposal.

Catherine Smith called this
meeting a forum for suggestion,
criticism and ‘‘equal exchange.”
Complete and detailed reactions
from faculty members are to be
forwarded to the subcommittee

for final review by the second
week of November.

Smith said she has “no idea
what the faculty’s response will
be,” and won’t know until this
point.

The Committee on Instruction
and the writing subcommittee
will then revise the program ac-
cordingly, though the chairman
said she has no desire to present a
“watered down” proposal to the
full faculty.

She said the final program will
probably be voted on at the facul-
ty’s monthly meeting in
December.

In addition to Catherine Smith,
the others on the subcommittee
are Assistant Professor of
Chemical Engineering Michael
Hanyak, Professor of Chemistry
William Scouten, Assistant Pro-
fessor of Philosophy Frank
Wilson, Associate Professor of
English Philip Withim and
Teresa Twomey ’81.

The proposal now outlines what
it calls a lower division require-
ment and an upper division re-
quirement for writing courses.

The two types of writing courses
in the lower division are
designated W1 and W2. The pro-
posal describes a W1 course as
one ‘designed to teach fun-
damental techniques of writing.”’
A W2 course is a “writing em-
phasis course’’ that is ‘designed
to teach writing in accompani-
ment to other study.”

The upper division requires that
“an advanced course emphasiz-
ing writing must be taken by all
students during their last four
semesters.” Furthermore, the
proposal suggests this require-
ment should be met ‘‘in the stu-
dent’s area of concentration or
major.” The proposal designates
this type of course W3, and
describes it as an “advanced
writing emphasis course.”

The proposal also provides for
the teaching of writing tutorials.
It states ‘“‘students may at any
time be required to take remedial
tutorials.” This tutorial require-

CATHERINE SMITH

ment may become necessary
under three basic kinds of situa-
tions.

First, a student entering
Bucknell may show deficient
writing skills in some of the areas
of what the proposal calls “‘entry
assessments’ — essays written
as part of the application, secon-
dary school records, scores on
verbal aptitude tests and ‘a
sample essay written under
uniform conditions at the Univer-
sity before the first semester.”

Second, a student may fail to
rcomplete a W1 or W2 course
satisfactorily.

Third, a student may be recom-
mended for a tutorial by a dean,
advisor or instructor.

The proposal explains further
that ‘‘courses designated W1, W2
and W3 might be newly
developed, or they may be
adapted from existing offerings.”
The Departments of English,
political science, chemistry and
the College of Engineering now
offer courses similar to the ones
proposed.

Along with teaching tutorials
and W1, W2 and W3 courses, the
writing program would be ad-
ministered by a coordinating
body known as the Composition
Council. The council would be
composed of ‘‘six members
drawn from across the Universi-
ty” with a chairman to be elected
from among the members of the
council.

tired of campaign

By DAVID 0’CONNELL

As the presidential campaigns ended their seventh week, voter
polls showed an increasingly negative view towards the partisan at-
tacks exchanged between President Jimmy Carter and Ronald
Reagan.

Although Reagan clings to a modest lead—43 percent to 35 percent
for Carter with 10 percent for Rep. John B. Anderson—many voters
said in an Associated Press-NBC news poll last week that they are
becoming “‘increasingly dissatisfied” with all of the alternative can-
didates.

Nearly 40 percent of the potential voters said that Carter’s cam-
paign had been mean-spirited and vicious, and almost 50 percent said
he did not deserve re-election.

Carter’s harshest criticism of his Republican opponent came in
Chicago Monday when he said that a victory for himself would bring
national unity while a victory for Reagan could mean that ‘“‘Americans
might be separated, blacks from whites, Jews from Christians, North
from South, rural from urban.”’

CAMPAIGN UPDATE

Also this week, Carter declared that his programs would lead to an
“economic renaissance,” and spoke of his record of reducing oil im-
ports and creating jobs.

Reagan’s response to the President’s attacks was more mild than
his previous speeches. ‘I can’t be angry,” he said, “‘but I think Carter
owes the country an apology.”

The Republican candidate said Tuesday that if elected he would
name a woman to fill “among the first Supreme Court vacancies in my
administration.” Strongly defending his position on equal op-
portunities for women, Reagan attempted to appeal to women,
who—according to the polis—are not supporting him as much as the ~
male population is.

In a rally for college students in Claremont, California, Monday,
Reagan was heckled ‘‘Heil, Reagan”’ salutes and the crowd chanted ,

“slogans about his stance on air pollution in the smog-choked area. He

responded by saying that ‘‘if it wasn’t for our generation they'd be say-
ing ‘Heil somebody’ today.”

Anderson’s campaign as an independent lost some ground in the
polls, and fund raising problems led him to seek more support from
past contributors. However, the formation of a committee of
celebrities endorsing Anderson — including actor Paul Newman and
writer Kurt Vonnegut — was announced in New York Monday.

Anderson predicted last Sunday that a surge of backing for his
candidacy would occur in the next three weeks which would give hima
chance at winning the election.

Objectors say
draft is imminent

The start of draft registration
has added “to the increased
likelihood of an actual draft, ac-
cording to Larry Spears, a staff
member of the Central Commit-
tee for Conscientious Objectors.

The CCCO calls itself the “‘na-
tion’s largest draft counseling
agency.”

Spears said the summer draft
registration of men born in 1960
and 1961 was ‘“‘just the first step
toward returning to the draft.”
He said the U.S. has ‘never had a
registration without a draft, and
rarely a draft without a war.”

CCCO has sued Selective Ser-
vice for their draft plans and
learned the Selective Service
plans to allow registrants to
claim hardship, medical and
conscientious objector status
“only at the last possible moment
after induction orders are
issued,” according to Spears.

Spears said “unless students
begin to think about, and collect
evidence for conscientious objec-
tion claims and other options,
they are certain to be caught un-
prepared.”

There is no longer a college stu-
dent deferment under the new
draft laws.

Carter aide cited
in cocaine inquiry

Two allegations of alleged co-
caine use by Tim Kraft, presently
on leave as President Carter’s
campaign manager, are being in-
vestigated by a special pro-
secutor from the U.S. Court of
Appeals.

Ina court order confirming the
appointment of Gerald Galling-
house as the investigator in the
case, Kraft was accused of hav-
ing used the substance both in
New Orleans and San Francisco
in 1978.

Kraft ran the day-to-day opera-
tions of the campaign until Sept.
15, when he took a leave of
absence after the allegations
became publicly known. How-
ever, he said he was ‘completely
innocent of the charges.”

Before taking over the election
effort, Kraft worked as an aide
under White House Chief of Staff
Hamilton Jordan, who was ac-
cused of using cocaine at New
York’s Studio 54 discotheque.

refugees there for the past six
weeks. The refugees are leaving
the fort now, and the program is
“winding down,” according to
project Director Donald Carroll.

The program has been “‘amaz-

‘Nuke’ messages written by a
fraternity, not by anti-nukers

By SUSAN MACDONALD
and MATT KARANIAN

Chalk graffiti etched on the
sides of buildings here three
weeks ago bearing the messages
“Nuke,” ‘Get Nuked,’’ and
“Become Nuclear Waste,’’ were
written by members of Kappa
Delta Rho fraternity, according
to KDR president John Whitaker
"81.

The messages were part of.an
“unauthorized” advertising cam-
paign for a ‘nuclear energy par-
ty” the fraternity sponsored two
weeks ago, Whitaker said.

In a letter to the Bucknellian
last week, Vice President for Ad-
ministration and Finance John
Zeller charged that ‘‘anti-nuke
supporters” had written the
chalk messages on the pillars of
Coleman and Marts Halls.

Zeller said these ‘“‘single issue
proponents” acted in conflict

Assistant Chief of Security Mike
Amarante and Fine have assum-
'ed shifts in the patrol rotation to
help fill the shortage, he said.
Find said ‘‘so far it’s no pro-

with the ‘‘very principles they en-
dorse”’ by defacing the buildings.

Whitaker said the messages
were written not by ‘‘anti-
nukers,” but rather by ‘“‘some of
the guys from the house.”’ He said
they were “‘not acting under the
authority of the social chair-
man.” It was ‘“‘not a good idea’’
and he would ‘“‘not have sug-
gested it,’ the KDR president
said.

However, the writing was
“probably effective,” Whitaker
said. ‘I would assume that it gets
more exposure than the posters,
especially for those people who
only go to the U.C. once a day. It
supplements the posters.”

Whitaker said ‘like commer-
cials or advertisements, the more

Lynn Jenkins ’82, president of

nuclear energy — said ‘‘the anti
nuke supporters did not write on
the walls,” and said Zeller’s
charges were not currect

Jenkins said ‘‘obviously
someone who feels as strongly
about the environment would not
do something like that.”

There are ‘“‘clearly regulations
which prohibit writing or putting
signs on the walls of the
buildings,” according to Zeller

Zeller said he was ‘‘sorry to
have maligned’ the anti-nuclear
groups with the charge in his let

however, made “no mention of a

Romper Room rejects?

We’ve all heard the reports that the nation’s high schools are
graduating an alarming number of illiterates. But we know that to
attend a college like Bucknell—Barron’s College Catalogue says we
‘are “highly competitive,” if that matters—you can’t be a member of
that select group of Romper Room rejects.

That’s probably why a faculty survey rates only 10 percent of the
students here as illiterate.

Wait a minute, let’s hear that again.

Yes, it’s true. The survey also reports professors rate about 50
percent of their students ‘“‘more or less competent”; another 15 per-
cent are said to have ‘‘serious problems.’’ Advanced calculus is un-
necessary to determine that this leaves a mere 25 percent of the stu-
dent body receiving faculty approval.

A subcommittee of the University Committee on Instruction has
proposed that students be required to take three writing courses at
beginning, intermediate and advanced levels.

100 level English composition courses are virtually the only of-
ferings the University has for writing improvement. The English
Department and the tutor are overburdened. We strongly endorse
this proposal and insist the University make immediate plans to put
these measures into practice. The results of the faculty survey are
most disturbing. A $7,000 yearly tuition fee leaves no room for com-
placency concerning the ability to write, intrinsic to everyone’s
education.

Warning a week away

The mid-semester break, the seeds for which were planted
proudly in this column almost two years ago to the day, will blossom
in a week for the first time.

After a period of nurture through the ABS Congress, the Univer-
sity Committee on Instruction, the calendaring office and the full
faculty, the four day respite from an otherwise grueling 12-week
regimen is here for the benefit of all. But—and we cannot emphasize
this fact or warn people of it enough—the break has a one-year con-
tract only.

The faculty can and very likely will cancel that contract and
take the break away next year if too many of us leave before our last
academic commitments Friday and arrive after our classes have
begun again Wednesday morning. If you read this page you have
heard that line before; if you think we are trying to drum it into you
through repetition, you’re right.

There are just so many ways to say it, but this appears to be the
most straightforward: Stick around now and you will benefit later.

Advancing the arts

Julius Bloom, in his report on cultural events at Bucknell, unwit-
tingly hit upon one of the issues that has long been holding the
University back artistically. He proposed the formation of a “new
entity on campus” to serve as overall coordinator for all the arts
organizations now in existence.

What Bloom did not know is that such an organization does exist.

Most students don’t know about the Association for the Arts at
Bucknell, either, which is the significant fault of the group. The
association stands as an example of a group with good intentions
that lacks the knowledge and expertise to work these hopes into
tangible and effective realities.

Bloom’s report says the ‘‘new entity’ should be “headed by a
qualified person who gives his of her principal time to the assign-
ment.” It seems logical that — in setting up a truly professional arts
association — those in charge would want at the helm a person with
training in the field of arts management who could devote full atten-
tion to the running of such an organization.

If the University honestly wants to advance the artistic at-
mosphere on campus, the first step is the appointment of such a per-
son to take charge of and reshape the Association for the Arts.

Because we want everyone on campus to receive the
newspaper before the beginning of the mid-semester
break, the Bucknellian will be published next on Thurs-

Not ice: day, October 23.

sident explains controversy

Recycling Group pre

To the Editor:

As president of the Bucknell
Recycling Group, I feel com-
pelled to make further comment
on the controversy concerning
the control of recycling group
funds. In the spring of last year,
Professor Coder and the group
had several disagreements con-
cerning club policy.

Members of the group sup-
ported the expansion of recycling
efforts on campus as well as in
the community. Coder did not.
Members of the group were en-
thusiastic in our financial support

of Bucknell Environmental
News. Coder was not.

These disagreements
precipitated Coder’s resignation
as the group’s advisor. However,
Coder did not relinquish his con-
trol of the group’s bank account,
which contains about $4,600.

Coder feels that by doing so, he
will be protecting the interests of
past students who recycled in the
belief that the money earned
from their activities would go in-
to a trust fund, the interest from
which would provide a scholar-
ship for a local high school stu-
dent.

The current leadership of the
recycling group feels that Coder
is mistaken, and that control of
the account should revert to the
recycling group. To resolve this
issue, the recycling group has
asked the ABS to petition the ad-
ministration for a review of
policy. This review has been
granted, and will be carried out
by the Committee on Com-
plementary Activities.

To support our case, we have
contacted all but one of the past

six recycling group presidents,
all of whom agree that the funds
in the account should be used to
expand, and make more efficient,
the recycling effort at Bucknell.
It is rather obvious that $4,600
dollars could go a long way
toward improving our facilities.

I would also like to respond to
our critics that the recycling
group does a tremendous job for
an all-volunteer student
organization. I doubt if many peo-
ple fully realize the magnitude of

our operations. For example, last
semester the group recycled
more than 115,000 Ibs. of paper.

More than 70,000 lbs. of paper
have been recycled in the first
month and a half of this semester
alone. Bucknell is fortunate to
have enough concerned students
to make this worthy effort possi-
ble.

Bob Doms ’81

Recycling Group

Actions speak louder
than words on any wall

To the Editor:

I join with John Zeller in regretting the fact that some
nameless individual(s) recently felt it necessary or justifiable to
express themselves on the pillars of Marts and Coleman Halls.

However, I feel that a distinction must be made between the
truly ‘‘well-intentioned and highly moral” anti-nuclear proponents
and the person(s) who think that defacing property with anti-nuke
slogans is the best or only means of expressing their active con-
cern; that is, if they are concerned at all. I believe that the former
are, according to principle, inherently concerned with protecting
the aesthetics of the environment, while the latter seem not to be.
For these individuals, the popularity of the ‘No Nukes” cry seems
to have obscured the very reasons behind it, rendering it almost
meaningless. I ask you to recognize the essential difference bet-
ween these two groups, and not to place blame unjustifiably on the
wrong persons.

To the former group, more thanks for joining in the rally at
Berwick and for your continuing support of the environmental
movement.

And to the latter, whoever you may be, a request that you think
twice before engaging in irresponsible actions that might tarnish
the work of those who are not simply voicing, but also acting upon,
their beliefs. Actions do speak louder than words on any wall.

Lynn Jenkins ’82
President, Students for Environmental Awareness

Demands direct dialing

To the Editor:

I find most amusing the oc-
currence of two separate but
related incidents within the last
few weeks. The first is a report of
the faulty pay phone system on
campus, resulting in a substan-
tial bill to be footed by the
University. It seems that
students were able to place long
distance calls from pay phones
without the operator requesting
any deposit of coins.

According to the freshman
class president, the problem has
been rectified: all tolls are to be
paid by the University, i.e., the
student body.

The second is the article in the
September 19, 1980 issue of the
Bucknellian concerning a new
phone system for the University.
What amuses me is that this is
the third such article the
Bucknellian has run in the four
years I have been here. The latest
one reports how Gerry Commer-
ford indicated that for the first
time, the University has fixed a
target date for completion of said
system (August, 1981).

I was quite perplexed by
reading this, especially when,
upon a little research, I
discovered that in the April 7,
1978 Bucknellian, the University
was to have its new phone system
by September 1980 (last month).

Again, the September 14, 1979
issue of the Bucknellian promised
anew system in the ‘‘fall of 1980.””

These two incidents, together,
should be a caveat to both
students and administration. To
the students: while we may have
been promised such a useful and
needed revised phone system, we
have indeed been led on and
somewhat prostituted in the past,
so don’t get your hopes up.

To the Administration:
whether you were ever aware of
it, there has been and always will
be a demand for a phone system
that allows for the placing of
direct long distance calls. It is
high time you quit the deceptions
and act on that with which you
seem so effusive with words.

Former recycling president’s view

To the Editor:

The conflict over the use of Recycling Group pro-
fits has been recognized by each of the past
presidents of the group. A silent dissension from
Professor Coder’s hope of a scholarship fund was
the rule. The long-range goal envisioned by both the
presidents and the consensus of the group centered
on continuing and expanding the recycling effort at
Bucknell and possibly in Lewisburg.

Three presidents managed the Recycling Group
prior to the spring of 1976. All were still active in the
group in the years 1975-76. That spring David Ander-
son ’77 handed the presidency over to me. Discus-
sions in Recycling Group meetings with those past
presidents — all at once or in separate meetings —
conveyed the intention of using the group’s profits
for maintenance and expansion of recycling efforts.
Each of the three prior presidents described to me
their hope, which was also the consensus of the
group, of using the funds in this way.

Vocal approaches to Coder on the matter were
avoided, primarily out of respect for his extensive
help in the operations of the group. Coder acted as

Virtue of
discipline?

To the Editor:

Given the general aura of
frivolity that normally surrounds
Homecoming, I was pleased and
gratified to see that the brothers
of SAM chose to use the occasion
of their participation in the
parade to extoll the old-fashioned
virtue of discipline.

the link with the paper buyer in Williamsport, often
cut corners for the group with the Physical Plant,
and had his secretary keep the financial records.

At one time between spring, 1976, and spring, 1978
during my presidency, the group again faced the
problem of listing priorities for the use of their pro-
fits. A proposal for a fund of $500 for scholarship
was made and approved by the group. $100 was to be
allocated for five consecutive years.

All other monies were to be used for recycling
purposes. Although follow-through did not reach the
Office of Financial Aid, Coder should have received
notice of this decision.

I do not know of the policies set by any charter nor
the initial agreement with the administration and
Coder. I do know, however, that each of the
presidents, beginning with Doug Bastion ’76 and
through myself, has expressed the desire to spend
the major portion of the group’s profits for recycl-
ing efforts, and not ona scholarship fund.

Around campus I hear ominous
rumblings from honest and in-
telligent people about not voting
for Jimmy Carter come
November. Some of the rumblers
intend, so I gather, to vote for
Ronald Reagan, although I
honestly don’t know why; no one
has yet presented me with a
plausible example of a positive
attribute possessed by the former
Governor of California.

But if one has a hankering to
elect a senile fascist as Presi-
dent, I doubt highly that anything
that I might say here would
scratch that itch. More troubling,
however, are those who ap-
parently intend to vote for John
Anderson, but I think that I can
offer good reasons for not choos-
ing that course of action. Let me

begin with an historical anecdote.

Once, long ago and far away,
when the world was much dif-
ferent than it is now, a fat, in-
telligent and reasonably honest
fuddy-duddy named Hubert
Horatio Humphrey was running
for president against a dangerous
paranoid named Richard Milhous
Nixon. Hubert, for reasons not
clear, decided to follow LBJ in his
self-destructive support of what
Mr. Reagan tells us was a noble
crusade in southeast Asia to
either rid the world of Com-
munists or, failing that, rid it of
gooks in general.

Many of us, including your nar-
rator, said, as November 1968 ap-
proached, “Humphrey, Nixon
... what’s the difference?”’ and
so voted for Eldridge Cleaver or
Moose Skowron or Mickey

here refer not so much to the
Watergate follies as to the more

Cambodia, the packing of the

progress.

Well, here I am a_ second
semester senior at Bucknell. All
that I can say about my time at
Bucknell is that it was just too
brief. Too, too brief. In only a few

am certainly not leaving without
any memories.

Bucknell is such an incredible

(Query: why does Anderson
spend most of his time attacking
Carter, anyway? Reagan’s posi-
tions ought to seem more heinous
to him.)

Third, the spectre of a Reagan
presidency is so frightening that
we ought try anything to avoid it.
In all sincerity, I would vote for
Richard Nixon were he the only
alternative to Reagan.

Many Anderson supporters
argue that one ought to vote for
the best man. This, I think, is ab-
surd. One ought to vote to have
the best president, and this
means voting for someone who at
least has a chance of winning. If
one is not interested in who can

win, and wants to vote for the
best man they can find, it is cer-
tainly the case that there are bet-
ter people around than Anderson.

My personal suggestion is that
you vote for Frank Wilson.
Although I am not certain that
Frank is the best, I am certain
that he is far more intelligent,
honest and capable than John
Anderson.

I think that this is a crucial
election, very crucial indeed. I
am honestly frightened by the
flood of jingoistic sword-waving
rhetoric spouted by both real can-
didates, and I honestly find
Carter a less than thrilling can-
didate.

But I also think that any in-
telligent and honest person who
(unlike the New York Liberal
Party) contains the urge to be
self-indulgent with his or her
vote, will be forced to conclude
that even if a vote for Carter
means four more years of in-
competence, then that represents
a small price to pay to keep
Disneyland out of Washington.

perly.

Of all the physical features of
Bucknell I like the golf course
most. As a matter of fact,
Bucknell reminds me of a golf
course. We have the players, and
we have the caddies, and each
know their job. There are many,
many foursomes at Bucknell, and
if you’re willing to play by the
rules you can join a foursome too.

Of course, if you don’t want to
play by the rules you have to putt
by yourself. But there’s always
the possibility that if you weren’t
born to play you might just make
a great caddie.

The only problem to all this is
that those who play by them-
selves sometimes get in the way.
But after all, hopefully after
Bucknell we will all belong to
“real” golf courses like our dads
and have plenty of ‘‘greens”’ to
ourselves.

The ‘“‘pros”’ at Bucknell are in-
credible also. They care very
much that we all perfect our
games. Although it is tough at
times, if we all conform to the
proper stance, keep our heads
down and grip as we’re told, after
four years we’ll really knowhow
to play the game. It’s really great
how the ‘‘pros’’ give us so much
instruction and we don’t even
have to talk to one another.

Well, I think it’s about time to
go out and spank some Spaldings
(and maybe a few of those
lonesome puttsters too, ha, ha).
It’s about time this place was
cleared of those who don’t want to
play along with everyone else.

If you want to come along
maybe we could nudge a few of
those sluggards off the course
with our cart.

Put on your alligator shirt and
meet me at traps. See ya there.
Fore!

The typical sub

By TODD G. BUCHHOLZ

One of the more saddening car-
toons I’ve seen depicts the extinc-
tion of the suburban family. In a
museum are stuffed versions of
Johnny and his baseball bat, his
sister in pigtails, his mother with
Tupperware and his father
holding a briefcase.

This Parents’ Weekend, it
seems appropriate to consider
the fate of suburbia and the post-
World War II dream of owning a
home and raising kids in a safe
and serene neighborhood.

Quite a bit of evidence points
away from the lifestyle so many
of us grew up with. The economic
situation forbids young couples
from purchasing new homes. In-

terest rates for mortgages and
labor costs for construction are
extremely high.

Even the local school system,
the foundation of suburban com-
munities, is floundering. More
and more districts have become
regionalized. State boards of
education are usurping authority
from neighborhood boards.

Leftist and liberal economists
like John Kenneth Galbraith
smile, denigrate our “affluent
society,” make us feel guilty
about our roots and profess that
small scale village units would
serve people better.

Despite these preachings, the
suburban community has served
us well. We may snicker at the

typical high schools we attended
and we may deplore the fast-food
chains in our towns, but growing

up in that environment was not

The point here is not sentimen-
tality, but to recount the small
yet memorable benefits of subur-
bia that elicit the envy of both ci-
ty and rural kids.

I cannot imagine the continued
growth of these communities in
defiance of our frenzied
economy.

Fewer people can afford
homes; this trend will not soon
end. Nor will cheap energy and
transportation soon return. The
number of young couples living in
suburbs will most likely decline.

I do not foresee extinction,
however. It is too early to step in-

urban family may become extinct

to the museum display. Enough
people already in communities
will stay to maintain the suburbs,
perhaps on a smaller scale. And
the social benefits will offset the
economic drawbacks.

The fate of our whole society
will be determined in this decade
by America’s responses to fiscal
and energy crises. If mass
transportation becomes pro-
fitable and desirable, the
suburbs will make a comeback. If
inflation-recession cycles are
halted, people will be able to af-
ford suburban life and we will not
be the last generation.

These are hopeful assumptions.
But we suburbanites have always
been optimists.

Unbearable cafeteria lines

ON THAT ABIT, OH AND Not
QUITE SO MANY POTATOES

By KRIS FORSYTHE
The lunch line crowds,
although tolerated in the past,
have recently become obscene.
For those eating in the cafeteria,
especially those having to endure
the agony of the fast pass, the
lunch hour experience is
transformed from a potentially
pleasant repast to a nerve

shattering test of endurance.

The problem begins at approx-
imately 11:55 a.m., when classes
let out. Since two out of the three
doors are locked, the first
obstacle occurs in trying to
squeeze through the one open
door to the ticket punchers. Over-
worked though they are, the pun-
chers punch quickly enough to
allow an overflow of diners to
back up into the condiment table.

tray—if there are any—the true

test begins. Passing the confec-
tions (since they are invariably
unreachable anyway), one at-
tempts to approach the ‘‘main
course.”

People are virtually tied in a
human knot, with nobody taking
the 27 plates of food lined up on
the shelf. The workers serving
the food are often distracted: not
with work, but with discussion
about fall break rides and yester-
day’s test.

After grabbing any plate
available, the beverages are next
in the muddled procession.
Assuming one has not been im-
paled by the catty-cornered milk
machine, it is usually relatively
easy to sidle up to the ice con-
tainer.

However, finding glasses is tru-
ly difficult, and trying to break
the one solid lump of ice without
an ice pick is work fit for the

physical plant. And, when one
finally has the precious glass of
ice, there is nothing but seltzer
water to put in it.

Now, with skim milk over ice
and a cold hot dog, the diner must
try to find a seat. The best bet is
probably to sit outside on a picnic
bench, even though it may be 35
degrees. And seconds are im-
possible, considering it is now
time for 12:45 classes, and people
are still waiting to get trays.

An exaggerated observation? I
think not. As for solutions, I look
to the Dining Service and/or the
administration.

If something is not changed
soon, I think the introduction of a
7-1 meal plan should be seriously
considered.

swing for

By DAVID BLACKMAN
Talented artists from five
states will gather in the
Lewisburg Armory to market
their wares for the eighth year in
arow at the Lewisburg Craft Fair
today through Sunday.

Long a traditional outlet for
craftsmen, these fairs represent
the sole means of reaching the
public for many artists besides
being their primary means of in-
come. Many of the artists are
professionals who have dedicated
their lives to producing quality
goods with their hands, and
through this decision have chosen
an alternate lifestyle.

From an economic standpoint,
most craftsmen earn only enough
to purchase the items they need
to live and to continue producing.
They are not usually affected by
the rampant inflation rate in the
pricing of their goods and can

believe their time and workman-
ship is worth.

The Lewisburg Craft Fair,
coordinated by Sue Balchunas, is
a juried showing. This means
each exhibit is judged and
evaluated before entry can be
secured. The judges look for
quality, durability of workman-
ship and degree of creative
design in making their decisions.
Each artist chosen to participate
pays a pooth fee to the fair
organizers, but any profits
beyond that belong to the artist.

This year’s fair falls in con-
junction with Parents’ Weekend,
‘as have those in the past, and is
large enough — 75 exhibitors are
present — to provide a variety of
wares. At the same time, it is in-
timate enough for the relaxed
friendly atmosphere
characteristic of traditional
fairs.

Represented at the fair are
both functional and decorative

items such as stained glass,
wooden toys, jewelry, leather
goods, candles and stoneware in
unique shapes and glazes. At the
food counters, goat’s milk fudge,
old fashioned clear candy and
dishes provided by the Valiant
Trencherman restaurant will be
available.

The craft fair was begun as a
vehicle to help people appreciate
quality handmade goods, and the
traditions and development
behind them, according to Bonnie
Bussard, director of the fair. It

“has since grown into much more,

Bussard said, with many people
from Lewisburg and the Bucknell
community — as well as visitors
from Washington, D.C., New
York City, Philadelphia, Pitt-
sburgh and Harrisburg — atten-
ding the fair.

Bussard credits the warm
reception from the public and the
professional quality of the craft

Tartuffe.

Mme. Pernelle.

By DAVID HAWKINGS

The Cap and Dagger production of
Tartuffe this weekend in many ways
parallels the dramatic group’s staging of
As You Like It for Parents’ Weekend au-
diences a year ago.

Both romantic comedies are laced with
deceit, double identity and subtle and in-
creasingly complex twists of plotline. Like
Shakespeare’s play, the Moliere comedy
on the Coleman Hali stage tonight, Satur-
day and Sunday is directed by University
Theatre Director and Professor of English
Harvey Powers.

- ye

And in both it is Patrick Pedro ’81 who
comes closest to stealing the show.

From the moment of Pedro’s entrance in
the second scene as Orgon — the master of
the house in which the play takes place as
well as the pivot around which all other
characters move — he leads the cast
through the twists and turns of the evening
with a finely honed sense of comedic tim-
ing.

This is a good thing, too, for too often the
rest of the cast as an entity is unable to
keep up with the French playwriter’s wit,
translated somewhat laboriously into two
hours of rhyming couplets by Richard
Wilbur.

Pedro handles the script and the com-
plicated staging finely, however. He sets
the pace of the humor from center stage,
for the play is much more Orgon’s than it
is the title character’s. While Tartuffe is in
its simplest form a play about hypocrisy
personified by the title character, his
qualities are brought forth by Orgon and
the other members of his household.

It is well that Pedro has been elevated
from the role of comic reliever as
Touchstone last fall to take on the central
position here.

Tartuffe, the falsely pious man whose
actions are the subject of the play, should

Orgon, played by Patrick Pedro ‘81, engages in an argument with his daugh-
ter’s maid Dorine, played by Cynthia Lempert ‘82. The two bicker constantly
in Moliere’s comedy “Tartuffe,” which opened Thursday for a weekend run

definitely be the character second in
strength and influence to Orgon. Un-
fortunately, senior Barry Fishel’s inter-

pretation of the role is considerably less |

than overpowering. While his outlandish
pontifications and fabrications could rival
the farcical nature of Orgon, Fishel seems
content to let Moliere’s lines speak for
themselves.

This casualness is most unfortunate in
the second act, when Tartuffe seems to
lumber through an otherwise enthrallingly
bawdy seduction scene with the buxom
Elmire, the second wife of Orgon played
by Amy Beth Cohn ’83. While Cohn plays
this scene — and the rest of the play — with
an aloof and sophisticated coyness, Fishel
seems only to be going through the mo-
tions.

The other disappointing showing in a
major role is by Dodie Rippon ’82. As
Orgon’s mother Mme. Pernelle, she again
fails to capture positive attention,
something that has eluded her since her
Bucknell debut in the Shakespeare comedy
a year ago.

In the opening night peorformance
Thursday, Rippon seemed baffled and
rushed, alternately mumbling through or
overemphasizing the stilted patterns of
speech Wilbur’s translation is full of. As
the actress charged with acclimatizing the
audience in the opening scene with this un-
familiar method of dramatic technique,
this is regrettable.

The other comedy star and scenes
stealer of the evening was Cynthia
Lempert ’82. As the loud-mouthed and live-
ly Dorine — the maid of Orgon’s daughter
Mariane (Jackie Krull ’83) — Lempert ex-
ercises the rhythms and rhyme of the
script with a caustic wit. The scenes she
plays opposite Pedro, in which both vie
hilariously for the last word and the atten-
tions of the audience, are perhaps the
highlight of the production.

Like the last Cap and Dagger mainstage
production, unfortunately, even strong
scenes like these appear lost in the visual
surroundings created by the designer.

Elaine Williams, visiting assistant pro-
fessor of English and theater, has designed
a set evocative of a Louis XIV grand foyer,
but the garish green and brown color
scheme, the gaudy molding and banister
work and the baroque stairway were poor-
ly detailed and shakily executed. It is a
disappointment when compared to the
model that greets patrons in the lobby.

Dodie Rippon ‘82 appears as Mme
Pernelle (above) and Barry Fishel ‘81
plays the title role in the Cap and
Dagger version of “Tartuffe.”

Two inexplicable questions remain for
this reviewer. Why did the two servants
continue to add items to the set between
scenes? And why did a spotlight shine
briefly on and then off a wall-mounted
crucifix throughout Act I?

Not to worry, really; these slight an-
noyances are overshadowed by the good
will—if not the consistent standards of
quality in all aspects of the staging—of this
well intentioned piece of French frivolity.

Report recommends arts center and new committee

By LYNN RUTHERFORD
A series of proposals designed to improve the artistic
standing of Bucknell has resulted from a visit to campus
in December 1979 by Julius Bloom, a New York talent im-
presario and consultant.

“We became aware of Bloom through a contact in New
York. A trustee suggested that Bloom could be of
assistance and paid his consultant’s fee,’ University
President Dennis O’Brien said. O’Brien accepted Bloom’s
proposals in January and is planning an open discussion of
the document with selected members of the faculty, ad-
ministration and student body.

No date for this discussion has been set.

“We are considering all the proposals and are trying to
form a framework to begin work on them,”’ O’Brien said.

The 17-page report is comprised of an analysis of the
current stature of arts on campus and of a series of seven
suggestions to improve the cultural offerings of the
University.

Prominent among the areas of improvement is the need
for a new concert hall. ‘For what Bucknell should be
achieving in its cultural programming,” wrote Bloom,
“there is no doubt that it feels the lack of an adequate
large hall, one seating at least 2,000 people.”’

Such a hall would also include back stage areas,
workshops, storage space and possibly studios for per-
forming arts classes and groups, according to the report.

The report says the inadequacy of Davis Gymnasium as
a concert facility is obvious, and a study should be in-
stituted to determine what can be done immediately — at
relatively little cost — to improve the accoustics of the

gym.

O’Brien disagreed with the first part of this proposal.
“Tt is doubtful that the University needs a concert hall
with 2,000 seats,”’ he said. ‘“However, a new concert hall is
high on our priority list and there is a reasonable possibili-
ty of success in the acquiring of funds to build one.”

Bloom’s other proposed major adjustment of cultural
policy concerned the formation of a ‘‘new entity on cam-
pus which would be the University’s service agency for
cultural and intellectual programming, its promotion and
further development.”

This new agency would engage performing artists and
arrange for their accommodations here, in addition to
fulfilling the financial obligations of the cultural pro-
grams, Bloom’s report said.

The agency would also be the distributors of a new
calendar of cultural events occurring both on campus and
in surrounding local counties. He suggested that such a
calendar would be published quarterly and serve to in-
form students and to draw the University and Lewisburg
closer together.

“The role which the University can fulfill in its large
portion poses a major challenge and, boldly performed,

will enable Bucknell to project its image dramatically,”
wrote Bloom of an “‘outreach’” program between the
University and the town. The program would include per-
formances in schools by campus theater and musical
groups, as well as presentations to the community by
members of the faculty and administration.

“These suggestions are all reasonable and are being
considered,” O’Brien said. “‘An arts committee is present-
ly in existence with (Director of Student Activities and UC
Programs) Jim Hammerlee at the helm, but an agency of
the sort described in the report would have far greater
control over the calendar of cultural events.”

Bloom commended the University’s decision to play
host to the Fitzwilliam String Quartet as resident artists
in two of the last three years.

“What has been instituted with the residency of the
quartet serves as an incentive for further development of
Bucknell’s cultural programming and enhancement of its
national image,” he said.

O’Brien concurred adding, ‘Resident artists add to the
ongoing texture of the campus. Our policy leans more
toward resident artists than one-shot superstars.”

O’Brien said the Oct. 8 New York engagement of the
quartet — sponsored by the University — was a critical
success and widely publicized, giving the University na-
tional exposure.

Bruce Springsteen
releases album 5

By ERIC HOERNER
The long-awaited fifth album by Bruce Springs-
teen, entitled The River, was finally released this
week after a gap of more than two years since the
release of the last Springsteen album Darkness on
the Edge of Town .

The River, a two-record set, is a classic album. It

won't be long until it reaches the top of Billboard’s [

album chart.

The album is more similar to his first two albums,
Greetings from Asbury Park and The Wild and the
Innocent, than to his third and fourth, Born to Run
and Darkness.

Technically, The River is Springsteen’s best
album. The heavy orchestration and garbled lyrics
of his earlier albums are absent—the instrumentals
in every song are very clear and, with the exception
of ‘Crush on You,” all vocals are intelligible. This is
a contrast to the Darkness album on which the
vocals in most of the songs are very difficult to
understand.

Although the songs on The River are like those on
Springsteen’s first two albums, the mixing and
engineering Of the new one is far superior. This
album sounds best when played at a high volume.

The River contains the usual Springsteen themes
of nighttime, driving cars and pursuing women, and
he combines all three in “Drive All Night.”’ There
are several sad songs, such as “Wreck on the
Highway,” ‘Point Blank” and “The River,” but
overall the songs are more positive than on previous
albums, especially Darkness.

Although most of the songs are brand new, Spr-
ingsteen performed “Point Blank,” “Sherry Darl-
ing,” “The Ties that Bond,” “Independence Day”
and “Drive All Night” at various times during his
1978 tour. A performance of The River was also in-
.cluded in the No Nukes movie.

: me,
The cover of Bruce Springsteen’s new album,
The River, released this week by Columbia

Records. This is his first release in two years.

“Hungry Heart,” featuring Flo and Eddy on
background vocals, will be the first song on the
album to be released as a single.

Side two tells the complete story of the pursuit of a
girl, beginning with “Hungry Heart,” progressing
to “Crush on You’’ and “I Wanna Marry You,” en-
ding with “The River.”

Springsteen’s group, the E Street Band, is ex-
cellent as usual but the star of the band is Clarence
Clemons on saxophone. Clemons has many solos

and is the driving force in ‘Sherry Darling,” the

“fraternity rock’’ song.

Also notable is Roy Bittan’s piano work in ‘Point
Blank’? and Max Weinberg on drums in ‘Jackson
Cage”’ and “I’m a Rocker.”

The long wait for The River raised the expecta-
tions of Springsteen’s fans. The album proves once
again that Springsteen, as a lyricist and musician,
is in a class by himself. It was worth waiting for.

BJRE spends ‘A Night
in Tunisia’ and returns
with an album in hand

By ROBERT FESSLER

Tunisia, Bucknell Jazz and Rock Ensemble’s fifth album, is a
virtual feast of music, ranging from the scat sounds of Count Basie
to Stan Kenton’s version of “The Star Spangled Banner.”

To be released within the next month, the album blends
breathing musicality, spirit and just plain enjoyment into each
piece, and credits the musicians who compiled this jazz lover’s
delight.

“500 Miles High,” a chart by Chick Corea, features the inspired
solo of Bob Galloway ’80, the group’s pianist. Perhaps the most ef-
fective piece of the album, ‘500 Miles High” features clear, well-
performed solos enhanced by a backup sound that does not over-
power them. Accurate articulation clinches the professionalism of
the piece, to leave the listener asking for more.

‘Basie’s ‘Blues in Hoss Flat’”’ proves that solos are not limited
to an elite group of instruments. Jim Snedeker ’81 shines with his
baritone saxophone, one of the unsung instruments of jazz.

Phil Woods’ chart, ‘“‘The Last Page,’”’ combines a blues and
swing sound with a fine alto saxophone solo given by Matt Murray,
former member of the class of 82.

The album, however, is not without flaw. ‘Inner Crisis,” by
Blood, Sweat, and Tears, is indeed a crisis of overdone articula-
tions, pushy dynamics, lack of control and inaccurate notes. The
otherwise sagging piece is saved only by superb use of special ef-
fects which create a mystical mood, diverting the listener’s atten-
tion from the errors.

The outstanding performance of ‘South Rampart Street
Parade” easily overrides the problems of “Inner Crisis.”’ Clarinet
soloist Tom Yuschok ’80 is featured in this unusual blending of ear-
ly New Orleans jazz, moderate rock and a polka-like sound. The
woodwind section displays its many talents and fuses the sound into
a unified song.

Stan Kenton’s ‘Star Spangler Banner”’ brings out the patriot in
every music lover, despite trumpet cracks and an intonation pro-
blem in the trombone section. This number is fresh, imaginative
and reasonable well-executed.

B.J.R.E.’s sensitive rendition of “Reasons,” an Earth, Wind,
and Fire chart, is perfected by Murray’s award-winning alto sax
solo that conveys the song’s mellow tranquility provides a magnifi-
cent solo.

However, Elaine Christo ’80, female vocalist, leaves the

‘listener disappointed, for although she has potential, her garbled
words and uneven vibrato mar the song’s otherwise fine sound.

Dizzy Gillespie and Frank Paparelli’s ‘“‘A Night in Tunisia,”
the title cut of the album, gives alto sax player Yuschok a chance to ,
display his inspiring ability. Yuschok is aided by the pleasant soft
rock sound of junior Steve Armacost’s trumpet.

“Make a Joyful Noise,” by Dominic Spera, creates a musical
collage by mixing the sounds of modern jazz, light rock and the
light rag sound of Scott Joplin. The Bison Chips, Bucknell’s barber-
shop quartet, perform a two-word solo in this unusual, yet striking-
ly appealing piece.

Outstanding performances are given by Murray, the sensitive
alto sax player who seems to have an emotional rapport with his in-
strument. Drummer Bob Ritter ’83 holds the group together with a
sturdy, well-interpreted beat, while Galloway’s piano wizardry
completes the sound of the group.

Coordinators Yuschok and Murray did a fine job in selecting
the highly talented group of musicians and the album provides an
easy-listening evening of a variety of jazz.

The Bucknell Jazz and Rock Ensemble has a hit in Tunisia that
music lovers should take advantage of.

Where to eat with the ’rents:
round-up of area restaurants

By AMY FORTGANG

Parents’ Weekend is upon us
and, though the usual decisions of
what to do have been made for us
by the University, those of where
to eat are still very much in the
, open.

Lewisburg, despite its relative
isolation from any large
metropolitan areas and its rustic
lack of worldly sophistication, of-
fers to the hungry Bucknellian
and visiting parents a choice of
dining experiences varying wide-
ly in cuisines and costs.

Lewisburg proper, the one-
street town of shops and vintage
houses, contains within its tiny
circumference four restaurants
in walking distance of the Univer-
sity campus.

Temperance House (N. 2nd

seafood dishes, but the main at-
traction of this restaurant is its
sumptuous salad bar. This
spread includes not only the usual
fare of lettuce and other basic
salad fixings, but also a large
variety of hot and cold
vegetables, potato, relishes, con-
diments, cheeses, fruit, hot
breads and butter and soup.

The salad bar comes with
every dinner and is available as
an entree ($5.45) for the weight
conscious — and even those who
are not watching their diets. In
keeping with this ‘“make-your-
own’ theme, there is an “ice
cream sundae festival’’ ($1.25) on
the dessert list. The description
reads: ‘‘We provide the ingre-
dients — you provide the im-

CHADWICK'S, Route 147, Northumberland.

Street. Open 4:00 p.m. to mid-
night Saturday) provides a basic
— somewhat unimaginative —
but good menu of steak and
seafood. Seafood ranges from
fried clams ($4.95) to breaded
shrimp ($6.50) with the expected
broiled lobster tail ($11.50)
heading the list.

Steaks include chopped sirloin -

($5.25), filet mignon (a
reasonable $8.50) and New York
boneless strip steak ($8.50, 11 0z.;
$10.25, 14 0z.). All dinners are
complete and are served with a
sidedish the breaded
mushrooms are recommended —
bread and butter and a beverage.

The atmosphere is bland but
shows a no-nonsense approach to
eating that is both tasteful and in-
expensive.

The Arena (At the junction of
Market Street and Route 15. Open
4 p.m. to 11 p.m. daily), though
attired in a rather overdone
southern Mediterranean decor,
serves well-prepared steaks, in-
cluding roast top sirloin ($6.95)
and a prime rib of beef that
comes in three sizes (petite
$8.95, regular $10.95 and large
$12.95).

There is a small selection of

agination.”

The Arena is famous in the
area for its frozen strawberry
and banana daquiris.

The Lewisburg Inn (At the cor-
ner of Market and Front Streets)
is the most elegant dining room
within the immediate vicinity.
Situated in one of the restored
houses that add to the pictures-
que scenery of Lewisburg, the
Inn seats only 85 people at one

“time and offers a gracious am-

bience unavailable in any of the
other restaurants in the town.

Dinners vary widely in subject
though they do not offer a highly
unusual presentation. Fresh
scallops broiled in butter ($9.25)
and Alaskan king crab meat
broiled in butter ($12.25) are good
choices for the seafood afi-
cionado, while roast stuffed
chicken ($8.00), leg of lamb
($8.00), New York strip steak
($11.75) and veal cutlet ($9.00)
round out the menu.

Every dinner includes a cheese
and cracker plate, fresh rolls and
butter, a tossed salad and choice
of two fresh vegetables.

For dessert the Inn offers
special coffees ($2.50) and ice
cream/ligeur creations ($1.75)

along with their Bucknell-
renowned specialty peanut-
butter cheese pie ($1.25). This
last dish may sound unusual, but
common opinion rates it high.

The Valiant Trencherman (N.
2nd Street. Open for dinner 8
p.m.-11:30 p.m., Friday and
Saturday; for lunch Saturday and
10 a.m.-2 p.m. for Sunday
brunch) is the most innovative of
the Lewisburg restaurants and
gives diners who are tired of the
average fare a refreshing change
of pace.

The menu centers on fish,
chicken and vegetarian dishes,
though it does not give the im-
pression of being non-gourmet.
Stir-fried chicken in ginger and
garlic sauce ($6.65) is fresh and

“interesting, while crab-stuffed!

mushrooms ($7.50) gives the
gourmand palate cause for
celebration.

Also available is a cheese fon-
due for two ($14.00) that is cer-
tainly satisfying for a duo of
hungry people. Each entree is
served with salad and choice of
two fresh vegetables — each of
which has a new twist.

For dessert there are cheese
cakes and herbal teas (.35).
Lunch has a similar menu with
the addition of bagels, quiche,
salads and sandwiches (prices
vary depending upon garnishes) .

Sunday the highlight is brunch
($2.25, $3.50 or $5.00) featuring
bagels,
quiche, cheeses and onion soup.
The atmosphere is casual and
relaxed without being sloppy —
more like a Greenwich
Village cafe than a Lewisburg
eatery.

For those exploring farther
afield the area holds two
restaurants worth traveling to.
All serve high quality food, but
with prices to match, and are a
driving distance of 10 to 40
minutes.

restaurant with a gourmet fare
equal to that of many New York
establishments.

The menu covers all areas of
food from fowl — including the
typical duck a l’orange flambe
($10.95) and the more. unusual
chicken breast with broccoli and
cheese ($6.95) to steak
(averaging $9.75 per, dinner) to
fish. Under this heading is
listed frogs legs with sweet and
sour sauce ($10.75).

All dinners include a sidedish
and the salad/bread bar (also
available as an entree for $4.25).

Dessert is the area where the
proprietors reach a high point.
Along with a special after-dinner
drink ($2.25) diners can savor one
of seven pies and three cakes.
The Chadwick’s olde English
oatmeal cake has no equal in the
area and deserves special atten-
tion.

The lunchtime menu includes
omelets ($3.25), salads ($3.50),
crepes ($4.50) and sandwiches
(from $3.00 for a fish sandwich to
$4.75 for a grilled reuben).

Bucknellians.

Its table haute menu includes
such items as saurbraten ($10.25)

Bucky’s Place, Saturday
night’s extravaganza in Davis
Gymnasium, was an excellent
idea ovroviding entertainment,
refreshment, a “night club” at-
mosphere and a common place to
gather for the alumni is
something the University should
do every Homecoming.

More care in preparation is
necessary for next year,
however.

The Jonathan Sprout Band
opened the festivities with a per-

“

formance matching their usually
high level of professionalism.
Had this level of entertainment
continued, Bucky’s Place would
have been a complete success.

Gil Eagles, billed as the
“fastest hypnotist in the world,”
was the headliner and next act on
stage. Eagles at first was enter-
taining, performing such men-

Bisons tackle Rams Saturday

By STEVEN SKOLNICK
and MICHAEL SUAREZ

The Bisons will try to improve upon their 3-2
record Saturday in a contest against West Chester
State College. Kick off is 1:30 p.m. for the Parents’
Weekend clash.

The Golden Rams sport a 2-3 record with victories
over Glassboro, 35-14, and Friday’s 41-17 victory
over Bloomsburg. Their losses came to Delaware,
the sixth ranked division I-AA squad, American In-
ternational and Millersville.

The Bisons lead the series 2-0 with a 24-13 victory
in 1977 and a 29-14 triumph in 1976.

The Herd will have to contend with the Golden
Rams’ split veer offense, a formation the Bisons
haven’t seen in four seasons.

Head Coach Bob Curtis states that the West
Chester rushing duo of halfbacks Ron Perkins and
Tyrone Scott “may be the best pair we’ve seen this
year.”

Perkins, only a sophomore, has carried 95 times
for 591 yards and two touchdowns in five games.
Scott has 265 yards and four touchdowns on 51
rushing attempts and has returned eight kickoffs
for a 26.3-yard average.

In comparison, the Bisons’ Ken Jenkins ’82 has
carried 97 times for 641 yards and four rushing

touchdowns. He is also second in team receiving
with 10 catches for 145 yards and three touchdowns.

In addition, Jenkins’ average of 184.2 all-purpose
yards (rushing, receiving, kick returns) leads the
nation.

Quarterback Ron Gaynor directs the Golden Ram
offense that averages 21 points per game. Gaynor
has completed 36 of 71 passes for 630 yards and
thrown for six touchdowns with only four intercep-
tions.

Sophomore split end Bruce Carthon is the leading
West Chester receiver, with 13 receptions for 325
yards and five scores.

Defensively, the Golden Rams ‘‘know they have
to stop Jenkins’’ stated Curtis. West Chester’s 5-2
defense has allowed an average of 22 points per
game.

Curtis expects a physical battle, stating ‘‘West
Chester has excellent size. They’re bigger than we
are up and down the line.”

The coach warns against underestimating the
Golden Rams, noting ‘‘they have good talent’’ and
are “easily more talented than Slippery Rock,”
whom the Bisons defeated 25-6 Sept. 20.

Curtis observes of the division II school, ‘‘West
Chester has nothing to lose and everything to gain,”
adding,‘ Don’t look down your nose at West Chester.
It should be an interesting game.”

tercepted by Leopard safety Tim
McAndrew, eliminating the
threat.

The Herd realized their defense
had carried them through the
first two quarters as they headed
to the locker room deadlocked 0-
0.

“The defense kept us on top”
commented Curtis, adding ‘‘They
left Lafayette thinking they
would not make it to the end
zone.”

The Leopards could only
manage two first downs and 44
total yards against the stingy
Bison defense in the first half.
Bucknell’s scoring efforts of the
half were stymied by poor execu-
tion, turnovers, penalties and in-
effective special teams play.

The Bisons needed to generate
more offense to win and wasted
no time getting started in the se-
cond half.

On the second play from scrim-
mage, Jenkins took a handoff
from Locey and after Hall threw
a block on Lafayette defensive
end Ed Wallace, Jenkins followed
pulling guards Darren Ford ’81
and Al Wehrhahn ’81 until he

John Krupka ‘83 attempts to make a sliding tackle against
Gettysburg Sept. 19. The booters dropped their third
straight contest Friday against Bloomsburg.

Soccer loses by 2-1;
record falls to 2-4-1

By BOB DAVIS

The Bloomsburg soccer team edged the Bisons 2-1 in the rain Fri-
day night, to drop the Bisons’ record to 2-4-1.

The Huskies disposed of the Bisons on an unassisted goal by Luke
Sakalowski 11 minutes into the first half and another by Toby Ran-
ck late in the second.

The Bisons’ inability to turn scoring opportunities into goals, a
problem that has plagued the team all season, cost them their third
straight loss according to coach Craig Reynolds.

“It’s the same old story and it gets very frustrating,” said
Reynolds, adding, “I felt we controlled the game — they only had
three real scoring opportunities.”

The Huskies were able to capitalize on their first break, a bungl-
ed clearing attempt by Bucknell deep in its own end. The ball was
finally -corralled by Bloomsburg’s Sakalowski, who deposited it
behind goaltender Peter Puccia ’81 for a 1-0 lead.

Bloomsburg’s second score came on a penalty kick late in the se-
cond half.

The Bisons dominated all other aspects of the game, outshooting
the Huskies 30-11, but were unable to connect until Mark Brotherton
"83 banged home a shot late in the game on an assist from John
Krupka ’81. Brotherton has scored in five consecutive games for
the booters.

Reynolds assessed his team’s effort by noting, “We didn’t play
poorly from end to end, but weren’t able to finish. It’s a difficult
situation to handle; we didn’t play bad ball.”

According to Reynolds, the prescription for the booters’ offensive
woes is to use more crosses and increase outside play. ‘‘We’ve been
forcing the middle too much.”

He concluded, “‘There’s no magic solution — we know what we
have.”

The Bisons host Rider tonight at 7 p.m. Their 1-3-2 record in-
cludes a 2-2 tie with Rutgers, a team that defeated Bucknell 3-1 Oct.
4

Reynolds commented, “Rider is a big ballgame as the con-
ference is still up for grabs.’ The coach noted that Rider moves the
ball well, employing'a give-and-go attack.

The formula for victory requires that the Bisons ‘‘be aggressive
in our defensive penalty area and hungry in the offensive penalty
area,” according to Reynolds.

Volleyballers win
third straight match

The women’s volleyball team
raised its record to 4-7 Saturday
with a 3-1 win over Lafayette. The
Bisons’ third consecutive win is a
Bucknell record, as are the four
wins in a season.

Coach Terrie Grieb called the
victory ‘‘a total team effort,” as
the Bisons downed the Leopards
15-10, 15-9, 2-15, 15-9. Grieb said
she was pleased with the win.

“We didn’t have the attitude to
win before, but we do now,” the
coach said.

Grieb pointed out the great ser-
ving game of senior captain
Susan Bairstow as well as the
overall strong play of Jeanne
Groeneveld ’83. ‘‘Everyone
played well, and the team was
psyched for the game,”’ she said.

The Bisons’ next match is at
home against Gettysburg at 7
p.m. today. Grieb expects a tough
match but says “‘we’ll win if we
keep playing together.”

Rinus Michels quits
Aztecs for Germany

Rinus Michels of the
Netherlands, one of the world’s
most renowned soccer coaches,
has left his position as coach of
the Los Angeles Aztecs of the
North American Soccer League.

Michels joins Cosmos star
Franz Beckenbauer as the second
major N.A.S.L. figure to defect to
West Germany’s 18-team
Bundesliga, considered the most
competitive league in the world.
Beckenbauer, a two-time Euro-
pean Player of the Year, an-
nounced in July his decision to
join Hamburg of that league for
next season.

F.C. Cologne, which lost Coach
Hennes Weisweiler to the Cosmos
April 16, signed Michels as
technical director of the club.

Michels guided the Aztecs to a
20-12 record and a berth in the
conference final this season.
Under his guidance, the Aztecs
reversed a trend of losing
seasons, compiling a record of 38-
24. In 1979 Los Angeles also
featured the play of Michel’s pro-
tege, Dutch midfielder Johan
Cruyff, now of the Washington
Diplomats.

Four Bison golfers

qualify for ECACs

The men’s golf team placed
third in a field of 16 teams in the
ECAC Southern Sectional quali-
fying tournament hosted by
Bucknell Oct. 9, thus failing to
qualify for the finals. Senior co-
captains Dave Richards and Rob
Wagner, junior Mike Stoyla and
sophomore Rick Cramer
qualified for the ECAC tourna-
ment finals to be held at the Penn
National Golf Club Oct. 19-20.

California (Pa.) State captured
first place in the team champion-
ship with an aggregate score of
304, followed by Indiana Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania with 305.
Bucknell tied Slippery Rock for
third place with a 306 score.

Ken Stauffer of Indiana Univer-
sity captured individual honors
by carding a one under par 70.
Richards and Cramer tied for
fifth with 76 while Wagner and
Stoyla tied for seventh with 77.
Peter Orr ’84 finished with 81.

Coach Jeff Ranck believes the
Bisons did not play as well as
they could have. He said valuable
shots were lost on the putting
greens which were very fast after
being reconditioned for the 50th
anniversary of the Bucknell Golf
Club.

A bad start hindered the Bisons’
chances as the team was 19 over
par after four holes. Only one bir-
die was managed by the entire
five man team for the round.

Another scandal for
USC athletic dept.

The University of Southern
California’s department of
athletics, acting outside the
school’s standard admissions
procedures, directed the enroll-
ment of 330 scholastically defi-
cient student/athletes in the past
decade.

The majority of these athletes,
according to a report released by
USC’s new president, were foot-
ball players. But each of the other
14 men’s and seven women’s in-
tercollegiate varsity squads had
at least one of these athletes, all
of whom failed to meet the
minimum academic standards
required of entering freshmen.

A spokesman for USC — which
perenially yields teams that are
among the finest in inter-
collegiate athletics — said in Los
Angeles Tuesday very few of
these athletes had ever
graduated from the university.

The previous president had
condoned this program, another

-university spokesman said.

by such a small margin, re-
marked coach Pete Puccia ’81.
The Cardinals boast a 7-1
record this year and outscored its
opponents 84-5 last season en
route to a 12-0 ledger.

An indication of St. John’s pro-
wess is that they defeated Penn
State 4-1 at State College Satur-
day while the Bisons were
thrashed 5-0 by the Nittany Lions
Oct. 5.

The Bisons battled St. John’s
throughout the first half but even-
tually allowed their visitors a
goal with eight minutes remain-
ing on a hard shot to the upper
right corner of the net from 18
yards out, according to Puccia.

In the second half, the Bisons
“played them even,” said Puc-
cia, but allowed two more goals.
The Cardinals converted on a
breakaway eight minutes into the
half and closed out the scoring on
a penalty shot by Marianne
Laurini with five minutes re-
maining.

Despite losing their sixth game

in seven outings, Puccia said,
“We played them even in the se-
cond half,” adding, “‘We were
pleased with our effort.” He con-
cluded, “St. John’s is probably
favored to knock off Harvard in
this year’s national champion-
ship.” Harvard captured the na-
tional title last year.

Bitser Dexter ’82, playing ‘stop-
per,’ completely shut down
Laurini, St. John’s leading scorer
who is considered ‘‘the best
center forward in the country,”
said Puccia.

Freshmen Carey Grayson and
Kim Anderso:. were “‘outstanding
on defense,”’ added the coach.

The Bisons’ three goals in their
tie with Franklin and Marshall
Saturday proved their highest
output in their two-year history.

Mary Child ’81 scored the first
Bison, goal of the game by in-
tercepting a pass in the F&M
penalty area and blasting a shot
by the Diplomat goalkeeper.

Franklin and Marshall fought
back, however, and led 2-1 by
halftime.

Anne Joyce ’83 tied the contest
early in the second half by volley-
ing home a shot with her left foot
off a crossing pass from Jeanne
Anderson ’81. F&M again retook
the lead and the clock ticked
down on the Bisons.

However, with only five
minutes remaining, freshman
Karen Bernstein picked up. a
loose ball in the Diplomat penalty
area and scored unassisted to
give the soccer club its first tie of
the campaign.

The Bisons will try to gain their
first victory in their season finale
against George Washington Uni-
versity at 3 p.m. Saturday on the
West fields. George Washington
has an ‘‘excellent women’s soc-
cer program” and earlier this fall
“Jost in the finals to Penn State in
the prelude to the Soccer Bowl,”
stated Puccia.

Tennis tops record

By JAN BALAKIAN

By shutting out Lock Haven 9-0 at home Wednesday and trounc-
ing Delaware 7-2 in Newark, Tuesday, the women’s tennis team set
a University record by winning their sixth match in one season. The
netters have lost only to Colgate by a 6-3 decision Sept. 29.

Patty Koch ’83 opened the action against Delaware by surviv-
ing six service aces to topple Joyce Nidzgorski in first singles.
Sarah Krieger ’82 then bested Carol Renfrew 6-4, 6-2 in the second

singles slot.

Delaware captured their first point when Kirsten Schubauer ’81
lost 6-4, 6-7, 0-6, but Cindy Appel ’83 fought tenaciously to defeat
Meg Palladine 6-4, 3-6, 6-3 in fourth singles.

Senior Janice Huber won the fifth position with an easy 6-1, 6-4
victory over Carol Vigures but Laura Kirschstein 84 fell to Mary
Ann Swikart 6-7, 4-6 in the final singles slot.

The Bisons swept the doubles as Huber and Krieger defeated
Nidzgorski and Renfrew 7-6, 6-3, Koch and Appel conquered
Palladine and Gray 7-5, 6-3, and Schubauer and Kirschstein blasted

Hartel and Waechter 6-1, 6-0.

In the sweep against Lock Haven, Koch overwhelmed Karen
Conn 6-0, 6-0 while Krieger used a powerful forehand to upend

Denise Lebert 6-2, 6-1.

Schubauer continued the rout by knocking off Lori Emich 6-4, 6-

2 and Appel survived serving problems to edge Sharen Sazan 7-5, 6-
4, Huber used smooth strokes to trounce Gail Overdorf 6-0, 6-2, and
Kirschstein, despite suffering from a cold, conquered Page
Carigan 6-3, 6-2.

The netters end their season next weekend by competing in the
Salisburg Invitational to which they will send four singles players
and two doubles tandems.

Men’s X-country
still undefeated

By ROBBY STETZ

and JEFF CROSS
Weathering a soggy, slippery Delaware course,
the men’s cross country team recorded victories

over the host Blue Hens, 21-40, and Lafayette, 15-50, . ‘

in their final conference meet of the season.

The victory extends the harriers’ unbeaten streak Q

to 72 straight opponents since 1974.
Taking the early lead in the 5.1 mile race were

Jim O'Shea ’81, Steve Bigotto ’82, RickSayre’82and <2

Bill Reifsnyder ’84. Sayre noted, ‘Coach Gulden
wanted us to get out fast—we went out flying.”

Women harriers win

With seven of the top ten runners wearing orange and blue uniforms,
the women’s cross country team blazed by California (Pa.) Universi-
ty, 23-38, Lafayette, 15-50, and Messiah, 15-50 Saturday.

Robin Brooks of California turned in the fastest time with a 19:40
first place finish while Jo Burrell ’83 finished second in 19:57.

Judy Olson ’84 took third in 20:06 and Laura Gaydos ’83 crossed the

. finish line fifth in 20:26.

Junior co-captains Linda Accettura and Jean Lecates tied for sixth
in 20:23, while Julie Crossman ’83 and Nancy Nelson ’84 captured
eighth and ninth place, respectively.

Coach Diane Ware noted the improvement by the Bisons over last

> week’s times, stating, ‘I’m happy with the way they ran; they’ve all

Sayre and Reifsnyder pulled away from the other :

two Bison runners after 1.5 miles, eventually cross-
ing the finish tape tied for first.

Their 25:12 time broke the Delaware course
record by an astounding 44 seconds. Nevertheless,
Sayre commented, ‘It wasn’t an exceptional per-
formance,” since ‘‘it was a course record that could
be broken. We weren’t running that hard.””

Delaware runners Mike Gahan and Matt Kelsh
passed the Bison pack to finish second and third in
25:34 and 25:40, respectively.

The Bisons clinched the victory, however, when
O’Shea, Bigotto, Mike Debraggio ’81 and Glen
Gibney ’83 finished together in fifth place with a
25:53 time. Mark Hulme followed close behind with
a ninth place time of 25:59, as the Bisons placed
seven of the first nine finishers.

Reifsnyder, who won his third race in four
outings, commented on his success, stating ‘‘I didn’t
figure on being as high every meet. I’m sur-
prised and pleased.”

In dispelling Gulden’s early season fears of
Reifsnyder burning himself out by running so hard
in every race, last year’s Pennsylvania high school
champion stated, ‘I feel stronger than at first. I
have complete faith in Coach. The whole team is
peaking at the right time.”

The harriers compete in the IC4A championships
Monday in New York. Bucknell has never run in
the meet due to conflicts with the ECC conference
meet. The harriers, ranked 16th nationally, will face

such powerhouses as eighth-ranked Villanova,
Boston University and Syracuse.

Reifsnyder predicts, ‘If we run well, we have a
good chance of beating the competition. Villanova
didn’t run very well last week.”

As for his individual strategy, Reifsnyder offered,
“P’1l go out a lot faster my first mile to get good posi-
tion and then I’ll just try to hold on.”

Despite his considerable success thus far,
Reifsnyder adds, ‘‘There is no pressure on me. We
have so much depth that one person can afford to
have a bad day.”

The squad is also aiming for a sixth consecutive
ECC championship on Nov. 8 at Belmont Plateau in
Philadelphia. Gulden states, “Our number one goal
is to win the ECC championship.”’ The Bisons can
expect challenges from rivals St. Joseph’s, who the
Orange and Blue crushed 19-44 Oct. 4, and
Delaware.

Gulden predicts, ‘‘The possibility of improving on
last year’s performance (17th in the NCAA cham-
pionships) is definite if everyone stays healthy.”

Hockey drops pair; now 2-6

By LISA CERUTI
The varsity field hockey team
was defeated by Bloomsburg 1-0
Tuesday after a disappointing
loss to Lafayette Saturday.

The Bisons played offensively
throughout the Bloomsburg
game, but their numerous shots
on goal refused to pay off.
Bucknell held the Huskies
scoreless throughout the first
half, but Bloomsburg broke the
deadlock early in the second half.

The Bisons were unable to
come back, despite the fact that
they “played offensively at least
75 percent of the time,” ac-
cording to co-captain Jill Henry
81. “We held them throughout
the first half but our shots just
weren’t going in,” she added.

Jeanne Minahan ’83 played a
strong game while goalie Betsy
Doyle ’82 blocked many of the
Huskies’ low drives.

Henry commented that the
team’s weakness against
Bloomsburg was the same pro-
blem that the Bisons have had all
season. ‘Everyone played pretty
well but our shots weren’t ac-
curate enough. That’s been our
problem all year.”

Lafayette defeated the Bisons
2-1 Saturday by scoring the winn-
ing goal in the last minute of the
game.

Although coach Sally Starr said
the game was “well played by
both teams,” the forwards were
not “directing their shots with
enough finesse.” The Bisons had
twenty shots on goal while the
Leopards were held to five.

Bucknell dominated the first
half of the game in which Chrissy
King ’82 scored the only Bison
goal after two minutes on an
assist from Minahan.

The Leopards tied the game 13
minutes into the first half and for
the remainder of the contest both
teams exhibited strong defensive
play to keep the game tied until
the final minute.

Starr described Lafayette’s
winning goal as “controversial.”
She said ‘the shot was lofted into
the air near the goalie’s head. It
should have been called a

dangerous shot.” Doyle “had to
worry about protecting her head,
not guarding the goal.””

“Tt’s unfortunate that the game
has to look like a defeat. The
team played exceptionally well
and it’s frustrating to come up
with a loss after a game like
this,” Starr commented.

The twin losses drop the team’s
record to 2-6. The Bisons host
Lehigh Saturday at 11:00 a.m.
Henry is optimistic about the
game, stating ‘We won last year
and should be able to do it again.”

been working hard and although the flu went through the team, they
got better and did well.”

With three weeks left in the season, the squad usually begins to
“taper,” or reduce the running mileage required in practice.
However, ‘“‘because of the flu we had to taper the mileage a week early
so they could get better,”’ commented Ware.

The strategy evidently was successful Saturday as Bucknell cap-
tured first place for the second consecutive week.

Despite an anemic condition, Burrell has been the Bisons’ top
finisher each meet. According to Ware, ‘She has times that are close
to Anne Bishoff’s and Jo is only a sophomore.’’ Bishoff, who graduated
last year, finished fifth in the Easterns and 33rd in the national meet
last year.

Accettura is “doing super” in her first season on the team, ac-
cording to the coach. Lecates “‘had to take her sophomore season off
due to an injury and she has come back and is running consistently
well,” added Ware.

The team hosts the Bucknell Invitational at noon on Saturday at the
West Fields’ three mile course. Twelve schools will compete in the
meet, won last year by Penn State.

“Penn State, Cornell, Indiana University of Pennsylvania and West
Chester will be the toughest competitors,” observed Ware.

Defense, Jenkins stop Lafayette 14-0

By STEVEN SKOLNICK
and MICHAEL SUAREZ

In the Bison locker room
before Saturday’s game against
Lafayette, one word scrawled in
big, capital letters on the
blackboard said it all. That word
was “REVENGE”. The Herd had
not defeated the Leopards since
1975, and although the Bisons had
many chances to win last year,
the teams tied 0-0.

This year, Bucknell wasn’t go-
ing to let it happen again.

Throughout the first half,
though, it was the Bisons’ defense
that kept them in the game.

A misjudged punt reception
and a bobbled snap from center
on a punt resulted in Bucknell
fumbles, giving Lafayette the
ball in Bison territory twice
within the first five minutes. Yet,
the Herd defense stood its ground
and Lafayette could not manage
‘a first down.

In the first quarter, the Herd of-
fense sputtered as they were
unable to move past the 50-yard
line.

Senior defensive end Dave Hib-
bard thwarted the Leopards’
fourth drive of the quarter with
an eight-yard sack of quarter-
‘back Mark Lechmanik.

Before the quarter ended,
Lafayette twice gained posses-
sion within five yards of the mid-
field stripe but was unable to
muster any first downs. .

Not until the second quarter did
the Bisons put together their first
sustained drive.

Starting on their own 20-yard
line, the Herd marched down to
the Lafayette 22 behind the
running of halfbacks Ken Jenkins
82. and Marshall Hall ’83 and
fullback Geoff Gallo ’82.

Faced with a fourth-and-five
situation, Head Coach Bob Curtis
elected to go for a first down in-
stead of a field goal because
place-kicker Alvin Depew ’81
would have to boot into a strong
headwind.

Locey’s pass attempt was in-

Polo routs 4 more opponents

By DAVE KIRKPATRICK

Imagine scoring on your first 13 shots of
the game. Now picture the opposing goaltender
stopping only two of your team’s shots in the en-
tire game. If you can envision this scenario you'll
easily understand the results of the Mid-Atlantic
league water polo tournament at Cornell last
weekend.

Bucknell won four games over the duration of
the tournament to up their record to 11-1. The
Bisons began by demolishing Lehigh 31-0, and
continued by downing Indiana (Pa.) University
25-4, Cornell 21-7 and Penn State 27-7.

Captain Scott Schulte ’81 scored 10 goals
against Indiana, tying a Bucknell record, and
then smashed the record by tallying 11 times in
12 shots versus Cornell.

Tom Butler ’82 totaled 15 goals and 19 assists,
while Mark Gensheimer ’81 scored 17 goals for
the tournament.

The Bisons converted on a staggering 68 per-
cent of their shots for the weekend and have
outscored the opposition 208-38 so far this season.

Twelve different Bisons scored goals against
Lehigh as Chris Layton ’81, Dan Goss ’83 and Jon
Simone ’83 led the individual scoring with four

All-Blacks score six tries during
a 24-0 victory against Juniata ~

By DAVE LIONETTE

The Bucknell All-Blacks
trounced Juniata Saturday to
even their record at 1-1. The 24-0
win featured six All-Black tries,
while the squad showed signs of a
maturing offense and maintained
an aggressive defense.

The All-Blacks got off to a slow
start in the first half due to the
unsteady play of the newly posi-
tioned backfield. As the game
progressed, however, the team
began to perform as a'unit.

Bucknell’s first score came in
the early part of the opening half
when Bill Charlton ’81 rambled
up the sideline for the try.

Later in the half, John Lester
81 found his way through the
Juniata pack for the second

score, concluding the first half
with the score 8-0.

The All-Blacks came out in the
second half fired up, realizing
their potential for a romp.

The barrage began with a well
placed pop kick by Steve Dixon
81 to winger John Demas ’82 for
the score.

The next try came when
Bucknell’s pack pushed Juniata
to their own goal line and
Charlton took in the line out toss
for his second score.

The third All-Black try of the
half came soon after when Roger
Potdevin ’83 blasted up the mid-
dle on an assist by Steve Beck ’82.

Bucknell closed out the scoring
when John Baum ’83 hit paydirt

on a run down the sideline.
Bucknell’s forwards played well
throughout the game, while the
All-Blacks’ pack ran with the ball
well, winning almost every
scrum and loose ruck.

Bucknell’s strength and
dominance over Juniata enabled
them to get the ball to the backs
throughout the game. The backs
moved as a cohesive unit, ex-
ecuting plays and technique to
the best of their capabilities.

Don DeAngelo ’81 aided the
backs’ successful attack by tear-
ing up Juniata’s backfield with
hard running and an accurate
foot.

The All-Blacks’ ‘B’ side also
erushed Juniata, winning 21-0.

goals apiece. Gensheimer, Jeff Payne ’83 and
Scott Mutschler ’84 had three each, while Butler,
Schulte, Mark Corl ’81 and goaltender Tony Pax-
ton ’81 each scored twice.

Mike Hoffman ’83 played the last three
quarters in goal for the Bisons, turning away all
three shots he faced.

Although the rest of the Bisons’ victories
weren’t quite as convincing, they were never
really challenged. The Bisons continually ran up
the score in the first period and then coasted to
victory. They led Indiana 13-2, Lehigh 10-0, and
Penn State 10-1 after the initial stanza’s of those
games.

The Bisons host their only home tournament of
the year Saturday and Sunday. The competitive
field includes the perennially powerful New York
Athletic Club, as well as the Philadelphia
Athletic Club, Richmond, Cornell, Navy, Slip-
pery Rock and Bucknell ‘‘B’’, a team comprised
of most of the regular second teamers minus
Layton and Payne who will both play with the
varsity.

The New York Athletic Club figures to be the
toughest competition. Last year Bucknell
defeated the NYAC 3-2 in the tournament final.

‘loose coalition’

A group of 35 colleges and universities

The exact nature of the coalition — and
the extent of its “loose” structure — has
yet to be determined, O’Brien said.

The schools represented — which
O’Brien said all have basically similar
policies regarding opposition to in-
vestments in certain companies — met in
New York City Oct. 15 with the Rev. Leon
Sullivan, the author of the Sullivan prin-
ciples.

The principles, a standard of corporate
conduct Sullivan designed to insure the
economic welfare of blacks in South
Africa, are the cornerstone of the Univer-
sity’$ current plan for selective divest-
ment from companies with subsidiaries in
South Africa.

O’Brien said he has recently written
Swarthmore College President Theodore
Friend, one of the organizers of the
meeting, and asked him to expand on the
discussions held in New York.

O’Brien’s stay at the meeting was cut
short by a commitment in Detroit later
that day, he said. He was unable to par-
ticipate in much of the discussion of any
consolidation of the schools’ position on the
issue of South African apartheid.

The meeting was also organized by the
presidents of Oberlin College, Tufts
University and the University of Min-

nesota.

Reagan winner
in campus poll

Anderson lacks strong support

By DAVID HAWKINGS

Ronald Reagan is the favorite
presidential candidate of
students here, in contrast to the
overwhelming support for Rep.
John Anderson at the vast ma-
jority of other Northeastern
schools, a Bucknellian survey
shows.

The Illinois congressman —
whose independent candidacy
has consistently scored highest
with young and well-educated
portions of the national electorate
— finished third behind Reagan
and President Carter in a query of
both potential and probable
voters at the University.

Reagan was the favorite of one-
third the total number of
respondents to the poll, and he
had 35 percent of the preference
expressed by those likely to vote
Nov. 4.

The president was the choice of
24 percent of the total sample. Of
those planning to vote, however,
33 percent say they will cast their
ballot for the incumbent, putting
him in a virtual tie with the
former California governor.

The margin of error in the poll
of 190 students — or about 6 per-
cent of the. school’s student
population — is 2 percent. The
random systematic sampling of
opinion was conducted in
telephone interviews Sunday
through Tuesday. a

Anderson had 1 percent less
support than Carter in the total
poll, but fell far behind the two
major party candidates with only
18 percent in the tabulation of
probable voters.

The independent candidate has
won polls similar to the

Bucknellian’s conducted by stu-
dent newspapers this fall at
Lafayette and Williams Colleges
and in an Ivy League-wide survey
conducted by the Daily
Princetonian, which gave Ander-

vote.

One-fifth the total sample that
was asked who they would “like
to see win” said they had no
preference or favored a minor
party candidate such as the
Citizens Party’s Barry Com-
moner or Libertarian Ed Clark.

Only 14 percent of those plann-
ing to vote said they were
undecided or listed a candidate
other than Anderson, Carter or

he intersection of Route 15

A study to determine the feasibility of construc-
ting a footbridge across Route 15 at Moore Avenue
is being conducted by civil engineering students
Mike Mileo ’81 and Bryan Ritter ’82.

The impetus of the study is the result of a Sept. 23
accident in which Mary McNerney ’81 was struck by
a car while crossing the intersection, according to
Mileo, However, work on the project had begun
before the accident, Mileo said.

Mileo said the goal of the study is to make the in-
tersection safer for pedestrians, while determining
“what facility would best accommodate the Univer-
sity.”

Mileo and Ritter mailed questionnaires to
students through campus mail Monday asking if
students preferred construction of a “footbridge”
over, or a “‘tunnel’’ under Route 15, or if they believ-
ed “‘the existing facilities” were adequate.

“] want a footbridge,” Mileo said. He said he
wants to prove that it is the best option from both an
economic and structural standpoint.

tion last month has been released from Geisinger
Medical Center. Page 5.

The purpose of the questionnaire is to “see if
students want a footbridge, too,” Mileo said.

This feasibility study is being conducted through
the civil engineering department here, and is under
the supervision of Jai Kim, professor of civil
engineering.

Mileo said he plans to design a footbridge during
January, and to construct a physical model next
semester. He expects his study to be completed by
the end of this semester.

“A tunnel is not best,” Mileo said, regarding op-
tions for making the intersection safer. He said he
hopes students will agree. There is a culvert for a
brook at the intersection, and it is likely a tunnel
would leak, Mileo said. “It would also involve a lot
more work and disruption,” he said.

By DAVID GROSSMAN

The latest proposal for a tuition hike for
next year calls for a $1,000 increase, ac-
cording to a statement by University presi-
dent Dennis O’Brien at a meeting of the
ABS congress Tuesday.

The proposed increase, the fourth pro-
posal for a budget for the 1981-82 school
year, calls for a 13.8 percent tuition in-
crease. This version of the budget also pro-
vides a 15 percent wage and salary in-
crease to all University employees.

In an attempt to balance revenue and ex-
penditures, expenses for a new residence
hall telephone system, second semester
off-campus programs and plant deprecia-
tion reserves had to be eliminated from the
budget.

The fourth proposal is a result of an Oc-
tober 9 suggestion by Committee on Plann-
ing and Budget chairman Stephen Becker.
At this meeting, Becker asked Vice Presi-
dent for Administration and Finance John
Zeller to make up the fourth alternative,
containing the $1,000 tuition increase and
15 percent wage hike.

NEWS

rounding ocwoerssis) NEWS Pat
¢1.000 tuition hike is likely next year

There are three other proposals for next
year’s budget. The first alternative pro-
vides for 10 percent wage increases, and a
12.5 percent increase in tuition. This plan,
drawn up in April, was discussed during a
committee meeting on September 24. It
was agreed the committee would consider
an alternative proposal at their next
meeting.

The second proposal developed was
determined by “national economic in-
dicators” from the Department of Labor.
The percentage of increase was determin-
ed through a weighted average of increase
percentages over the past three years.
This average, a 12.2 percent increase, was
then applied to most important aspects of
the budget, forming a second alternative
for the Committee.

In an effort to improve upon the two
budgets that had already been drawn up, a
third alternative was prepared by Zeller.
Here, a 12.5 percent tuition increase was
proposed, to help find a 12.5 percent wage
increase.

The Committee turned to a fourth alter-

native. This option includes the most
severe price hikes of all the proposals be-
ing considered at this time and provides a
more balanced budget. Its tuition and
wage increases surpass the rises that
many colleges comparable to Bucknell
have incurred thus far, according to a 1980-
81 Tuition and Fee Study compiled last
April. Bucknell’s fees this year are below
the average and median costs of 17 col-
leges of Bucknell’s caliber, according to
the report.

University Provost Wendell Smith said if
Bucknell’s tuition is increased by ‘‘too
high” a percentage, students might turn to
less expensive schools.

At the Committee’s October 15 meeting,
Smith said ‘A $1,000 increase in com-
prehensive fee might place Bucknell in
very poor position relative to schools we
compete with. This could drastically hurt
our enrollment.”

Adherence to the percentages the
University has used during the past three
years would maintain a competitive tui-
tion rate. This would help insure that no

Page 3

potential students are lost because of high
tuition, Smith said.

The 15 percent wage increase proposed
by the fourth alternative is higher than the
proposed increases of salaries of instruc-
tors at similar universities, according to a
comparative survey.

The survey, which reports the wages of
teachers at Bucknell and compares them
with those of several similar institutions,
states Bucknell professors earn salaries
better than the average for other schools.
At Tuesday’s ABS meeting, O’Brien said a
final evaluation of our own wage increases
cannot be made until the proposed wage
increases of the other institutions are
known.

O’Brien also commented a $1,000 tuition
hike is too high. He said it is in excess of a
formula calling for no more than a 12.2
percent increase that the Committee
should have worked with. He said more ex-
tensive statistics from other schools would
help the Committee reach its final decision
on tuition and salary hikes.

Sydney Ahlstrom lectures Monday night in the University
Center Forum, the first in a series of speeches on religious
traditions in Pennsylvania.

Religious attitudes are
subject of lecture here

By TRICIA KENNEDY

Sydney E. Ahlstrom, speaking in the University Center Forum
Monday night, raised the question, “What impact have religious at-
titudes had on the social order?”

Ahlstrom’s lecture, “Puritanism and Quakerism: Reflections on
the Relation and Social Order,” was the first in a series of sixteen
lectures dealing with religious traditions in Pennsylvania spon-
sored by a grant from the Public Committee for the Humanities in
Pennsylvania.

Associate Professor of Religion William Becker directed the
presentation, and estimated that an audience of ninety persons at-
tended.

The high turnout of local residents was partly a result of publicity
generated by letters sent by the Public Relations Office to local
clergy, Becker said.

_ There were also several articles publicizing the lecture published
in local newspapers, Becker said.

Ahlstrom is a professor of American religious history at Yale.
He is the author of A Religious History of the American People. The
book discusses the influence of religion on American society, and
received the National Book Award in 1973.

America is a unique country in that it is a “product of the Bible,”
Ahlstrom said. Founded partly as the result of a “religious move-
ment” in England, the United States has become the ‘‘most
religiously-affiliated country in the western world,” according to
Ahlstrom.

The struggle of various theologians to make their ideas dominate
the American view of religion, he added, made this country ‘‘alert
to the development of power.”’

Two additional lectures on the theme of ‘Paths of Faith in Penn-
sylvania”’ will be held here. Robert T. Handy, Professor of church
history at the Union Theological Seminary in New York City, will
present ‘The Contribution of Pennsylvania to the Rise of Religious
Liberty in America” in the University Center Forum February 18.

ABS president seeks

academic

credit for student government

By MATT KARANIAN

Plans to obtain academic credit for serving as
president of the Association of Bucknell Students
look ‘‘fairly good,” according to ABS president John
Dzurinko ’81.

Dzurinko said he hopes the president of next
year’s congress — who will take office next
semester — will be able to receive credit from the
University for the ‘time and effort” spent.

Dzurinko said he has “met informally” with
Associate Professor of Political Science John
Peeler, and that it is likely that department will
sponsor his proposal for student government credit.

“The department is generally open to non-
traditional studies,” Dzurinko said. He said this was
his reason for seeking sponsorship from the depart-
ment.

Dzurinko said because of the “career orientation”
and “GPA mindedness” of students today, there isa
“smaller pool of students available for extra-
curricular activities.”

“Curricular and extra-curricular activities must
be combined” in order to generate interest, he said.

The current interest in extra-curricular activities
— which Dzurinko sees as low — is a “reflection of
the times,” he said. The student government here is
“basically inactive,” with enough students capable
of participation, but with “those willing on the
decline.”

The proposal for the ABS president to receive
academic credit would call for the student to write a
journal, Dzurinko said. The journal would be a
“continual update on how to run a student govern-
ment,” he said.

There would also be required readings on ‘‘how to
be more successful dealing with campus happen-
ings from the student government’s perspective,”
Dzurinko said.

The proposal Dzurinko is making calls only for
the ABS president to receive academic credit. He
said, however, that he will be seeking credit for the
ABS treasurer if his proposal for credit for the
president is successful.

Dzurinko said as ABS president he works an

average of ‘10 hours weekly, maybe more.” He said
this time is in addition to “‘as much as eight hours in
meetings alone’’ certain weeks.
Both the L’Agenda and the Bucknellian editors
have traditionally received academic credit for
their work. Jim Zimmerman ’81 receives academic
credit for one semester for serving as editor of the
yearbook.

Ken Quaas ’82 also receives academic credit one
semester, as editor of the Bucknellian. Quaas said
he works “‘at least” a 40 hour week.

Quaas said section editors for the newspaper
“work an equivalent amount,” and should receive
academic credit as well. He said the five section
editors do not receive “any academic credit.”

voting for him indicates a
pragmatism of the Bucknell
voter, who may realize the can-

Support for the congressman
has dwindled from a high of 18
percent this summer to about 10
percent now.

Carter’s nine point jump from
preferred to practical support, on
the other hand, may show the
reluctancy on the part of voters
here to cast their ballot for the
president, who many are
dissatisfied with in large part for
his institution of the draft
registration program that began
in August.

Reagan’s gain of 3 percent
from preference to committed
voting support is insignificant
given the survey’s margin of er-
ror.

where the additional support
Carter gets from those actually

One reason for Reagan’s
strength may be the concurrent
strength of the Republican Party
on campus. The poll shows 38 per-
cent here as affiliated with that
party, as compared with the 28
percent who said they are
Democrats and the 26 percent
calling themselves independents.

Democratic registration na-
tionally is the most common, and
independents outnumber
registered Republicans.

Amherst ‘Student’ not printing
after school cuts appropriation

The student newspaper of Amherst College stopped publishing this
week after its funds were cut by a student committee, according to a
report in the New York Times Wednesday.

In a letter to the Bucknellian Oct. 8, Opinions Editor Christopher
Bohjalian of the Amherst Student said, ‘‘The Student Allocations Com-
mittee has threatened to cut our budget to about 50¢ if we do not begin
to take drastic measures to cut expenses.”’

The committee allocated about half of the $15,500 the paper needed
to continue publishing.

The twice-weekly newspaper had a $35,000 annual operating budget,
about half from allocations from a student tax and the other half from
advertising revenues.

“Amherst College is the only respectable college in the country
without its own student-run newspaper now,” said the paper’s
publisher, Barry Volpert.

From APARTHEID, page 1

O’Brien said Sept. 24 he is not sure a
commitment to total divestment of
economic holdings with companies
discriminating against racial minorities in
the republic is the way to ‘“‘best use our in-
fluence” to achieve more equitable treat-
ment for blacks there.

Speaking at a seminar as part of the
“Justice in America’ program of the
Bucknell Student Lectureship, the presi-
dent said working from within the system
could produce “‘better results’ than the
“working outside the system”’ he said total
divestment would force.

The University Board of Trustees

adopted a policy of selective divestiture
‘when it voted in December 1979 to boycott
companies not following the six Sullivan
principles.

An ad-hoc committee of the board of
trustees is also making a review of com-
panies with South African subsidiaries to
determine if they are following Sullivan’s
six principles.

Sullivan — who recently returned from a
trip to study the variety of corporations in
South Africa — was the principal speaker
at the Oct. 15 meeting.

“There are two ways in which change
can occur in South Africa,” Sullivan said.

| Anti-apartheid ‘loose coalition’ planned

“One is bloody and the other peaceful.”

He said he hopes selective divestiture
“will slowly break down barriers without
bloodshed.”

Dean of Student Affairs John Dunlop,
who chaired the student, faculty and
trustee committee which proposed selec-
tive divestment to the board, said, “‘most
companies in which we have holdings
support the Sullivan Principles at this
point.”

O’Brien said ‘‘nothing has happened”’ in
the interim since the board vote a year
ago. ‘There is really no need to review the
policy now,” he said.

Bridge study begun

to determine options

From BRIDGE, page 1

Vice President for Administra-
tion and Finance John Zeller said
he would like the University to in-
stall additional lighting at the in-
tersection, and is seeking permis-
sion from the Pennsylvnaia
Department of Transportation to
do this.

Mileo said lighting ‘‘would not
have prevented” McNerney’s ac-
cident earlier this semester.

Zeller is opposed to construc-
ting a bridge because he does not
“think students will use it.”” He
said it would also have to meet re-
quirements for handicapped per-
sons.

Mileo said the bridge he hopes
to design would have provisions
for the handicapped. “The big-
gest obstacle seems to be
money,” he said.

He said he would be meeting
with Zeller this week to discuss
options for making the intersec-
tion safer.

Mileo met with PennDOT of-
ficials in Danville Tuesday to
look at a footbridge which crosses
over Route 54 there. He said he
would also be looking at the tun-
nel under Routes 11 and 15 in
Shamokin Dam.

McNerney’s roommate, Fran
Odell ’81, said she is researching
the number and nature of ac-
cidents that have occurred at the
intersection since 1972, when traf-
fic lights were installed. She said
she also hopes to conduct a traffic
flow study to see if there is a cor-
relation between “‘increased traf-
fic flow and number of ac-
cidents.”’

She said she will use the data to
“propose”’ a ‘‘course of action.”

released

from medical center

By MADELON HENEHAN
Mary McNerney ’81 was discharged from Geisinger Medical Center
in Danville Sunday. She was hospitalized — originally in critical condi-
tion — Sept. 23 after she was struck by a car while crossing Route 15 at

Moore Avenue.

While in the hospital, McNerney had physical therapy twice a day.
“She is up and walking but can’t see very well now,” according to her

roommate, Fran Odell ’81.

McNerney underwent treatment from an eye specialist Monday
about the “‘possibility of cosmetic surgery,” according to Odell.

Odell said McNerney’s “‘spirits are really good.’’ She does not know
if McNerney will return to the University, or if so, at what time.
McNerney could not be reached for comment.

The accident occurred at 8:45 p.m. as McNerney crossed the in-
tersection on her way to the Bucknell West, where she lives. She was
struck by a car driven by William Belsky of Lewisburg, who is alleged
to have run the traffic light which was red for vehicles on Route 15 at

the time.

Sullivan urges churches
to join apartheid battle

The author and namesake of
the six Sullivan Principles has
also called on all American chur-
ches to divest themselves of any
holdings they have in companies
refusing to improve the condi-
tions for their workers in South
Africa.

The Rev. Leon Sullivan made
the statement at a news con-
ference Friday at the National
Press Club in Washington, two
days after his meeting in New
York City with University Presi-
dent Dennis O’Brien.

“TJ am asking any church with
any connection whatsoever with
one of these companies in South
Africa to discontinue their
association including withdrawal
of stocks,’’ Sullivan said.

“Apartheid has got to come to
an end one way or another. If we
don’t exert pressure now with
economic means, there will be a
war to end it,” he said.

Sullivan is the chairman of the
International Council of Op-
portunity Principles and the
pastor of the Zion Baptist Church
in Philadelphia. He issued a
report on 140 companies with
South African affiliates who have
agreed to examine their policies
toward blacks, coloreds and
Asians.

Of these companies, Sullivan
found 37 to be making ‘‘good pro-
gress’ implementing the prin-
ciples. The remaining companies
were judged to be making either
“acceptable progress,” or as

crossing. ‘Immediately after the accident we wrote to the highway
department (the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation), ask-

Zeller said he has still received ‘‘no response.”

Mike Mileo ’81, and Bryan Ritter ’82, are currently working on a
Civil Engineering project with the goal of “making the crossing safer”
according to Mileo. They are conducting a study to determine the
feasibility of constructing a foot bridge across the highway.

Mileo said Zeller is only seeking to ‘‘placate’” students by having
more lighting installed. ‘More lighting would not have prevented the

Greece reunites with
NATO armed forces

After a six-year hiatus, Greece
rejoined the military forces of
NATO Monday, consolidating the
alliance’s vital southeastern
flank.

Greece withdrew from the
military wing of the alliance in
1974 to protest the Turk invasion
of Cyprus.

Turkey maintains military oc-
cupation of part of the island.

The Turks had opposed Greek
re-entry to the military alliance
until now. Turkey had demanded
a bigger share than before in
command and operational con-
trol responsibility in the Aegean
Sea area.

Since the Soviet intervention in
Afghanistan and the Iran-Iraq
war, Turkey has made several
gestures to improve relations

with Greece and has softened its
opposition to Greece’s full return
to NATO.

NATO’s concern over the
Greek-Turk dispute stemmed
from the realization that the
alliance’s central European front
was fairly stable, but that a main
danger for conflict seemed likely
to come on its northern or
southern flank.

Turk leaders welcomed
Greece’s return to the military
wing, saying it reinforced the
alliance and was in Turkey’s own
interests.

Columnist protests

against makeup use

Female students at Southern
Methodist University wear too

Carney, a weekly columnist for

the SMU student newspaper, the
Daily Campus.

After criticizing the women’s
“false goals of cars, clothes,
beauty and boyfriends” in his
column, Carney went one step
further. He called on SMU fe-
males to go without makeup for
a day, then he stood on campus
in his underwear, asking women
if he could wipe their faces with
a cotton swab to determine if
“their beauty was natural.”

Seventy-five women passed the
test by not wearing makeup, 15
failed, and 107 refused to sub-
mit to the scantily-clad column-
ist’s demands.

He’s not a Churchill, but Ronnie is not a senile f ascist

By TODD G. BUCHHOLZ
Add Richard Brockhaus to the
list of those who do not practice
what they teach.

Last week, on the page opposite
this column, the assistant pro-
fessor of philosophy and logic
presented a horrendously faulty
and fallacious argument on why
we should vote for Jimmy Carter.

Buried under hyperbole and
calumnies, the gist of Brockhaus’
assertions was: 1) Reagan is “a
senile fascist.” 2) A vote for
Anderson is a vote for Reagan. 3)
Carter is the only alternative.

I will reluctantly accept the se-
cond statement. The rest is folly.

Regrettably, Brockhaus
waltzed into the trap set by the
Carter camp and was duped by
their campaign strategy.

Under Robert Strauss’ supervi-
sion, Carter has spent months in-
sinuating and outrightly accusing
Reagan of being trigger-happy,
atavistic, simple and a risk to
anyone who wants peace.

Instead of presenting reasons
why Reagan is so monstrous

Brockhaus simply tells us that
“the spectre of a Reagan
presidency is so frightening that
we ought to try anything to avoid
it.’ Why is it frightening? He
doesn’t tell us, I guess it’s com-
mon sense among philosophers.
If wehad wanted unproven con-
clusions, we could have watched

THE
BUCH
STOP

Carter television commercials or
read New York Times editorials.

To discredit Anderson’s efforts
and compound the illogic, Brock-
haus uses a fatuous analogy.
“Many of us, including your nar-
rator, said, as November 1968 ap-
proached, Humphrey, Nixon...
what’s the difference? and so
voted for Eldridge Cleaver or
Moose Skowron or Mickey

Mouse, or whatever.”

Brockhaus then implies voting
for Cleaver and friends took
away votes from Humphrey, and
thus elected ‘‘a dangerous
paranoid named Richard Milhous
Nixon.” Wrong again.

Most voters who said ‘‘Hum-
phrey, Nixon, what’s the dif-
ference?”’ chose the lever
marked George Wallace. And
Wallace stole more votes from
Nixon than Humphrey. There-
fore, if citizens who turned from
the two major candidates had
stayed with the Democrats and
Republicans, “Tricky Dick”
would have won by an even
larger plurality.

Sorry professor, but now you
don’t have to feel guilty about
your vote in 1968.

Let’s be honest and try a little
reason. Campaigns are like our
cafeteria’s air pie; they’re most-
ly fluffy stuff. If we want to be
good citizens we can discern bet-
ween Carter and Reagan.

A vote for Reagan is a vote for
less federal government, freer
enterprise, stronger defense and

more local control over and
responsiblilty for social pro-
blems.

A vote for Carter represents ex-
pansion of the federal govern-
ment, regulation of business, who
knows what kind of defense and
more federal help or interference
in battling social ills.

that you are the best candidate?”

business; that businesses must

Choose for yourself. But I’m
appalled at the status quo and the
aimless route we followed to get
here.

A reporter put it best on Meet
the Press when he asked Jimmy
Carter something like this: “Mr.

cent this year, we are now ina

vestment is necessary for expan-
sion and that taxes and regula-
tion discourages investment is
simple—and pragmatic. And our
best hope for economic recovery.

His notion that the Soviet Union
as aggressive and expansionist is
exaggerated yet well-founded.

Reagan’s vision of a pros-
perous and strong America is a
bit sweet. But Carter has no vi-
sion.

Would a logical man choose

Questioning with fervor

We thought at first our presidential survey results would be
similar to those at other ‘‘frame of reference’ schools. John Ander-
son—who the national media has labeled the ‘‘darling of the kids, the
profs and the (college) grads’’—would emerge as the clear favorite
in this hothouse of academia as he has at so many others.

How regrettably wrong we were. Regrettable not because the
campus choice was not our own—a presidential endorsement is not
the aim here—but because this may show once again the unwill-
ingness of the student body to think freely, passionately and dif-
ferently.

The similarity of our results to national polls seems to show
students here to be middle-aged before their time; at the last mo-
ment we can question and challenge things social, intellectual and
political without practical repercussion, we seem content as a col-
legiate entity to absorb whatever is put before us.

It often seems that the “‘hothouse’’ atmosphere of life here has
given us “frame of reference’ of inbred, passive conservatism.
Perhaps those committed to instilling what Professor Jack Wheat-
croft calls ‘‘The Art of Disbelief’’ in the rest have been too vociferous
and caused our audience to once again shut its ears.

The emergence of Reagan and the quashing of ‘The Anderson Dif-
ference’”’ here, though unusual for an eastern college, is not in itself a
cause for panic.

What is alarming is the inability of our constituents—often even
our own reporters—to question and challenge their facts and beliefs
at every opportunity.

L e e ® t e ti e
iving with criticism

The Bucknellian has a policy of printing critical as well as
positive reviews of performances. The most recent of these articles
appeared in last week’s issue, and the reaction they received con-
firmed the saddening fact that an alarming number of students here
have not yet learned how to handle criticism.

Not all reviews will be good, and any performer with integri-
ty—professional and college student alike—will take the bad ones in
stride with some semblance of grace. That grace is painfully absent
here, and the University has frequently been subjected to petty
displays of hurt feelings.

Part of the college experience comes from examining mistakes
and striving to eliminate them; two paragraphs of valid critique are
far more valuable to someone truly interested in learning and im-
proving than are two pages of undeserved praise for a scrapbook.

As soon as he goes before an audience, a performer opens
himself to criticism—either by word of mouth or in a newspaper.
People here must be willing to take the consequences of public

display. They should not question. the right of a journalist to do his
job and bring into serious doubt their own qualifications.

Winning with integrity

The reputations of many universitites have been tarnished in the
past few months by revelations of tampered transcripts, academic
dishonesty and recruiting violations. One athletic scandal after
another has been uncovered.

The ‘‘win at all cost’’philosophy in intercollegiate athletics serves
to bolster the overall reputation of a university, but’ at the cost of
dropping academics from top priority in the minds of students,
faculty, administration and coaches.

The success of two athletic teams this season, and earlier this
week in particular, has given a far loftier reputation to this institu-
tion, yet our academic reputation remains unaltered.

Coach Art Gulden’s men’s cross country team, winners of four
consecutive ECC titles and 72 straight dual meets since 1974, re-
corded a stunning victory in the IC4A meet Monday against other
eastern cross country powerhouses, many of whom use scholarships
to entice athletes to enroll and compete.

Dick Russell’s water polo squad, winners of 99 of 111 games in four
varsity campaigns and participants in three straight NCAA cham-
pionships, captured the Bucknell Tournament with a rousing cham-
pionship game triumph.

As both teams continue their march toward the NCAA finals, they
must be commended for giving the University national athletic
recognition without compromising academic standards.

Arts Association accomplishments

To the Editor:

The “‘Advancing the Arts” section of your October
17th editorial page was filled with equal amounts of
inaccuracies and venom. Unless your intent is to
discourage such an endeavor, you might want to
make a few corrections.

The Association is not the ‘‘overall coordinator
for all the arts organizations now in existence.” It is
an Alumni-sponsored group whose main aim is to
get a Center for the Performing Arts built and
whose lesser aims are to present an annual Celebra-
tion of the Arts, a week of cultural events and to en-
courage the arts on campus wherever and
whenever it can.

The Association is only five years old and as a
baby in the arts can be proud of bringing to the cam-
pus such outstanding people as John Ciardi, Cicely
Tyson and Edward Villella. On March 13, 1981, we
will have John Houseman here for a lecture and
workshop.

We have given financial support to the initial
residency of the Fitzwilliam String Quartet and

Bucknell Recyclin

have pledged another $1,000 toward bringing them
back in the future. We have recently established a
C. Willard Smith Award for Dramatic Excellence to
honor an outstanding person in the field of drama.

How much do you think it would cost to hire a pro-
fessional coordinator for the arts? Our total
treasury is about $15,000, a sum that would pay for
only part of his first year.

As an alumni-sponsored and alumni-directed
group we are governed by a code of rules adopted by
the Association and adhered to by its officers. The
University would have no right to “take charge of
and reshape” us.

Rather than hire a professional to coordinate the
arts, I would suggest that Bucknell find a profes-
sional newsperson to teach you and your staff ac-
curacy in reporting and proper tone in writing.

On behalf of the League of
Women Voters of the Lewisburg
area I want to thank the Bucknell
Recycling Group for their efforts
in expanding recycling beyond
the University and into the com-
munity. The League recycling
committee under the direction of
Nora Elze had been working on
community awareness of the
necessity for more recycling, but
it was not until we had the active
support and participation of the
Bucknell Recycling group this
past year that we were able to
begin to realize this goal.

The Bucknell Recycling Group
was largely responsible for a
very successful pilot project last
spring in which targetted areas of
the borough received curbside
pick-up of recyclables. Because

of the enthusiasm generated by
this effort, other groups in the
community were made aware of
the possibilities of large scale
recycling.

The local chapter of the
Kiwanis, who already ran a mon-
thly glass drive, agreed to in-
crease their program. They have
now installed a large sign identi-
fying the glass center and have
placed barrels for the deposit of
glass and aluminum outside the
building which permits drop-off
at any time. The League has
worked hard to publicize the pro-
ject and is currently working on a
handy flip-card manual with in-
structions on how and what to
recycle.

In short, the League is pleased
with what has been done so far to
raise the consciousness of the

community in this important
area. The Bucknell Recycling
Group’s aid has been invaluable.

Although monies from this
endeavor would be well spent on
a scholarship for a local high
school student, the community as
a whole would better benefit from
the increased efforts to improve
the efficiency of recycling and its
further expansion. From our ex-
perience with the Bucknell
Recycling Group, we have no
doubt they would not only use
past monies wisely, but would
return them twofold — the expan-
sion, bringing more money for
scholarships.

Negative criticism is very painful

To the Editor:

I am writing this letter at the risk of seeming
overly sensitive. I have tried unsuccessfully to
forget about the caustic review I received from the
Bucknellian’s David Hawkings, for my per-
formance in Tartuffe.

I am a theater major and take my art very
seriously. It is extremely painful to read a negative
criticism of one’s work, but it is worse when the in-
tent of the reviewer seems to go beyond corrective
criticism.

If my performance was poorly executed that is
one thing, but the reviewer went on to bring up his
dissatisfaction with my entire career here.

part of my college experience. For the hours and
hours of studying, rehearsing and performing, I am
not allowed the simple pleasure of sharing an even
somewhat fair review with my family and friends.

I would like to know how I got cast if I am truly
such an inadequate performer.

They say one should ignore reviews, but I guess I
am just not that thick-skinned. However, consider-
ing that Hawkings and I are both members of the
Class of ’82, I will probably acquire the hide of an ar-
madillo by the time I graduate.

Arts need understanding

Professor

Appalls

To the Editor:

I was appalled to see such
an article as Richard
Brockhaus’ in last week’s
Bucknellian. I think that the
“article’ should have been
placed in the Letters section,
as it was clearly nothing more
than the spouting off of that
author’s own personal opinion.

I think that the Bucknellian
made a mistake in granting
space to what I feel was a
slanderous attack on Ronald
Reagan and the Republican
party in general.

Rob Tyrrell 84
Ed. note: opinionated articles us-
ually appear in the opinions sec-
tion.

To the Editor:

Announced with the clumsy
headline, ‘‘Tartuffe: French
frivolity is ‘not fine,’’ David
Hawkings’ review proceeds
likewise in a reckless manner. He
neglects his responsibility to help
the audience understand this
complex and contextual comedy
and seems to prefer the lighter
task of pointing out the ‘‘disap-
pointing showings’’ of two cast
members.

This verbiage is at the expense
of mentioning the meritorious
performances of much of the
cast, including Scott Sherman as
Cleante and Jackie Krull as
Mariane.

At Bucknell, where the arts
need understanding and respect,
I question the worth of this lazy

criticism, and for that matter his
understanding of the play. Does
Hawkings expect gratitude from
the cast, director and designers
for his patronizing consolation
compliments of their “‘good will’”
and “intentions?”

Thanks to blood Sonvrs

To the Editor:

On Thursday, October 16 Bucknell students again demonstrated
their concern for those less fortunate than themselves with a very
successful bloodmobile visit. 290 pints of blood were donated with 26

referrals.

The drive, sponsored by Concern and Action, was superbly
organized by Beth Sipple. Alpha Phi Omega service fraternity pro-
vided the manpower to set up and take down all the necessary

equipment.

To these people and all the donors and helpers, many thanks from
the Union County Chapter of the American Red Cross and, of
course, from the patients in the hospitals of the Northeast Region
who will benefit from their generosity.

Mentor of logic faulted

To the Editor:

Upon reading Professor
Richard Brockhaus’ opinions of
Ronald Reagan in last week’s

Bucknellian, (he called the
G.O.P. candidate a ‘‘senile
fascist” among other things), 1
was at first startled and then
totally outraged by the irrespon-
sibility of his comments. I felt
that such a blatant display of
overly-emotional rhetoric re-
quired a response.

My anger stemmed primarily
from the manner in which
Brockhaus presented his opi-
nions. His method was to throw
out an opinion, usually based on
overgeneralizations or false
assumptions, and then provide no
factual support for his venemous
comments. (I believe his type of
argument is based on an informal
fallacy in the form of ad
Hominem abusive, which is cer-
tainly an inexcusable error for a
mentor of logic.)

The presidential candidates
themselves have employed this
tactic of “negative campaign-
ing.” The public, however, seems
to reject this approach; the poll-
standings of those issuing per-
sonal attacks are lower than

those of the candidates concen-
trating on ‘positive campaign-
ing.”

The presidential campaign
hardly needs any more of this ir-
rational mudslinging, especially
from a member of the Bucknell
faculty. I would advise
Brockhaus to keep his opinions to
himself unless he is able to
substantiate them with facts.

ARTS BRIEFS

Sanderson,
& May in ‘Vanities’

Anne Clemens ’81, Dawn
Sanderson ’82 and area resident
Amanda May have been chosen
to play the three roles in Cap and
Dagger’s December production
of Vanities by Jack Heifner.

Director Dodie Rippon ’82 an-
nounced the cast Wednesday
after two days of auditions.
Assisting her will be Lighting
Designer Allen Haines ’81, Scenic
Designer Mark Morrison ’81 and
Stage Manager Bruce Delaplane
82.

Each of the drama’s three acts
shows the women at a different
turning point in their lives — fall
of senior year in high school,
senior spring at college and a reu-
nion six summers later. As the

Clemens play progresses, the audience

sees the changes in each woman
and watches as these culminate
in the third act when all three
characters realize they were
never as alike as they once
pretended.

Three vanities are used as set
pieces and as areas for makeup
and costume changes to illustrate
the alterations in the women. It is
from these props that the play
gets its name.

‘Tristram’ lengthens

Tristram, the University’s art

tion, along with the beneficiary’s
name, is being kept secret at the
request of the donor.

The building will house
programs in art, music and

ARTS

By AMY FORTGANG
Successful performances were turned in by both
the Bucknell Symphony Orchestra and the Bucknell
University Chorale Saturday evening in Rooke
Chapel.
The traditional Parents’ Weekend concert of the
Chorale, conducted by Professor of Music Allen

Flock, was made more interesting and enjoyable .

through the diverse program offered by the or-
chestra, the Sem Gems, the Bison Chips and the
bag-pipes of Associate Professor of Japanese
Studies Jamie Pusey.

This weekend was the first time in the past three
years a conglomerate concert has been attempted,
and the result was superb.

The program opened with the orchestra’s rendi-
tion of ‘“‘Overture in the Italian Style” by Schubert
conducted by Christopher McGahan, assistant pro-
fessor of music.

The performance was of surprisingly high
caliber, especially the quality of the violin section.

There are only two complaints, both of which can
easily be corrected in any future performances.
Although the piece and the orchestra were outstan-
ding, it was a shame the audience had already
heard the overture rehearsed three or four times
before the actual performance.

The next time such last minute rehearsal is re-
quired, those in charge should keep people out of the
auditorium until the run-through has been com-
pleted. This will avoid spoiling an otherwise plea-
sant concert with repetition of the work.

It was also too bad the group could not play
another piece before quitting the stage. The chorale
portion of the program, though well done, was con-
siderably longer than that of the orchestra.

‘The Big Red One’ is a war movie
of strong sensitivity and deep feeling

By DAVID O’CONNELL

For those who have chosen to
stay in metropolitan Lewisburg
for midsemester break, the Cam-
pus Theatre offers Samuel
Fuller’s The Big Red One to start
off the vacation. It closes tonight,
so even if you’re going home,
there’s one more chance to catch
the film.

The Big Red One is Fuller’s
autobiographical tale of his ex-
periences in a World War II rifle
squad in the first infantry divi-
sion, whose nickname is derived
from a red number one on their
shoulder patches.

But while the film takes the au-
dience through Fuller’s battle ex-
periences in North Africa, Sicily,
France, Belgium and Germany,
don’t expect to see an epic
representation of democracy’s
massed march across Western
Europe. Instead, be prepared to
see an anti-war statement at its
most effective level — from the
viewpoint of the individual.

The rifle squad is transformed
from a confused group thrown in-
to battle to a toughened fighting
unit. The film concentrates on the
activities and development of the
group — examining the effects of
battle in microcosm.

Lee Marvin turns in a perfectly
cast performance as the veteran
sergeant, leading Mark Hamill,
Robert Carradine, Bobby Dic-
cicco and Kelly Ward as the core
of his squad. Carradine performs
the difficult role of the nar-
rator/chronicler — Fuller’s own

In a role quite different from
his work in the Star Wars mold of
the self-styled hero, Hamill con-
stantly struggles to justify the
difference between murder and

killing. He is at the same time the .

unit’s best rifleman and its most
hesitant killer. He grows from
freezing in fear on the beaches of
North Africa to heroically saving
his squad during Normandy’s D-
day landings. At the film’s emo-
tional climax, the liberation of a
concentration camp, Hamill ef-
fectively conveys the final
transformation to a killer.
Marvin also has an inner strug-
gle which he must resolve. The
film opens with Marvin stabbing
a German to death; he then finds
out that the armistice ending

Lee Marvin stars as the Ser-

World War I was signed four
hours earlier. The sergeant is
haunted by his error, and in the
character’s plot climax, he has a
chance to rectify the mistake.

The plot vehicle was an almost
vignette-like collection of the
squad’s isolated experiences in
battle. The fighting scenes were
well done, lacking the usual re-
quisite gore and profanity which
lesser directors fall on to convey
realism. Fuller instead evokes
real fear from the actors, and
believable reactions to death and
destruction.

The only problem in this
organization and the narrow view
of events is that it is difficult to
grasp an overall sense of plot
movement. Although thematic
development was direct and well-
conveyed, it took concentration to
sense continuity as the scene
changed suddenly into or out of
battle, to a different time of year,
or to a different country.

For those who worry about see-
ing an anti-war movie and prefer
the excitement of continuous bat-
tle, don’t worry. The Big Red One
is filled with realistic seat-
gripper battle scenes — Panzer
attacks, artillery shelling, the
suspense of flushing out enemy
snipers in a foggy forest, and
other bizarre and eerie effects
not found in the average shoot
’em up war flick.

One should see The Big Red
One for two reasons: to consider
the effects of war on the innocent
and uninitiated mind, and to ex-
perience some very excellent bat-
tle footage. Both should give the
viewer something to think about
over the long weekend. _

SYMPHONY PLAYS IN
Williamsport plays cello in the Susquehanna Valley Sym-
phony Orchestra's Wednesday evening concert here. The
group was conducted by Donald Beckie, associate professor
of music at Susquehanna University, through three tra-
ditional works. The performance opened with Beethoven’s
“Symphony No. 3 (Eroica).” Originally dedicated to Na-
poleon, the work was rededicated to an unknown hero
when Beethoven lost his admiration for the general. The
second piece, the overture from “Cosi fan tutte” by
Mozart, served as a preview for the orchestra's per-
formance with the Pittsburgh Opera Company

note for a parent audience
University chorale joined by orchestra, Pusey, Gems and Chips

Pusey provided an unusual sight as he marched
up the aisle of the chapel in full Scottish regalia. He
performed reels, marches and dirges of the
Scotsmen on his pipes and gave a welcome touch of
originality to the concert.

The choral portion of the concert was enjoyable
because of the quality of the voices and the varia-
tion of the program. From Latin prayers and
psalms, the singers moved to Slovak folk songs, in
the abstract style of Bartok that some find unplea-
sant.

Junior Virginia Church’s clear soprano voice, ac-
companied by Marianne Simonetti ’82 on the flute,
soared through the solo in “Weep, O Willow” by
Lekberg, while Claude Mason ’82, baritone, por-
trayed a somewhat “‘un-Jewish’’ but still comedic
Tevye in “If I Were a Rich Man” from Jerome
Boch’s Fiddler on the Roof.

“The Echo Song,” an innovative piece by di
Lasso, utilized a choir of nine answering voices to
represent the echo. ‘‘Ching-A-Ring Chaw” is an in-
ane song by Aaron Copland that could easily have
been eliminated.

The concert, tastefully short, ended on a light note
with the Sem Gems (Karen Levine ’81, Kristin Olsen
’81, Melissa Bodine ’81 and Jill Stranko ’81) presen-
ting two pleasant pieces for their first public per-
formance. They were immediately followed by the
Bison Chips (Richard Pisano ’82, Scott Thistle ’82,
Chris Brown ’81 and new member Howard Hillman
’84), whose performance was so well received they
were called back for an encore.

Of course, the groups had their most appreciative
audience in the chapel Saturday night — who claps
more loudly than Mom and Dad?

Volleyball splits

By LISA CERUTI

The volleyball team split a pair of home matches last weekend,
losing 3-0 to Gettysburg Friday but sweeping Lehigh 3-0 Saturday.

Gettysburg ended the Bisons’ three match unbeaten streak by
outplaying Bucknell in all three games during a 15-6, 15-13, 15-13
victory.

According to Coach Terrie Grieb, the spikers put up a fight in the
last two games but team play was lacking. “Nobody had a good
game. If we could have identified the specific problem, it could
have been corrected.”

She added, “The team didn’t play all week and was sort of stale
when it came to the game on Friday.” The Bisons’ had been idle
since a victory over Lafayette Oct. 11.

Serving was a major problem against the Bullets as approx-
imately 12 serves were faulty, Grieb said.

Bucknell regrouped Saturday with a 15-1, 15-13, 15-12 victory over
Lehigh. Grieb stated, ‘The entire team played well” against the
Engineers and captain Susan Bairstow ’81 “had her best match of
the season.”’

The coach added, ‘We lost to Lehigh last year (2-1) and we were
really up for a win.” Grieb noted, ‘“‘The serving was much improv-
ed and the play in general was definitely better.” The victory upped
the Bisons’ record to 5-8.

The junior varsity suffered the same fate as the varsity, losing to
Gettysburg 9-15, 11-15 and beating Lehigh 15-5, 15-4. Grieb com-
mended freshman Janet Rankin’s ‘‘excellent serving’ and
sophomore Carol Schmidt’s “all-round good game.”

The volleyball team has already won more games this year than
all of last when they had a 3-11 record. On their way to a 5-8 mark,
the Bisons have beaten both Lehigh and Lafayette, two squads that
defeated them last season.

The Bisons’ next match is at Shippensburg Friday, their first of
four straight road matches. The teams did not meet last season.
The spikers do not have another home game until Oct. 29 when they
host Wilkes College.

9 | Field hockey gains 1-1 tie on

last-minute goal versus ETown

By JAN BALAKIAN

Sophomore Maria Procopio’s
goal with 30 seconds remaining
gave the field hockey team a 1-1
draw at Elizabethtown Monday.
The Bisons won their third game
of the season Saturday with a 1-0
blanking of Lehigh at home.

The stickers now sport a 3-6-1
record and still have a chance to
qualify for the EAIAW Cham-
pionships November 6-8 with four
games remaining.

The Bisons’ play in the tie with
Elizabethtown (7-2-2) was
“sporadic” according to coach
Sally Starr. “At times we had
good passing and teamwork but
then we would enter the
doldrums.”

The Blue Hens, 3-0 winners
over the Bisons last year, opened
the scoring midway through the
second half before Procopio’s
marker gave the Bisons their
first tie of the campaign.

Jeanne Minahan ’83 had an
“excellent”? game at link ac-
cording to Starr. “She kept the
ball on attack and played a very
good defensive game,”’ the coach
said. Goaltender Betsy Doyle ’82
“made some good stops and suc-
ceeded in taking the pressure off
us,” added Starr.

After a scoreless first half

STUDY WITH THE LEADERS.

against Lehigh, the Bisons pro-
ceeded to play ‘intense, concen-
trated hockey”’ in the second half,
Starr said.

Nancy Dill ’84 scored the mat-
ch’s lone goal in the second half
on an assist from co-captain Anne
Kennedy ’81.

The coach noted, ‘‘We got the
goal and were able to maintain
the ball on attack and our intensi-
ty didn’t let them score.”

Starr praised the play of the en-
tire forward line of Dill, Pro-
copio, Chrissy King °82, Sue
Lenker ’84 and Becky Bittinger
84. The coach remarked, “King
played her best game of the
season. She did things I knew she

was capable of doing but hadn’t
done until this game.”

The Bisons have four games in
a busy final week as they scram-
ble to qualify for the EAIAW
Championships The stickers host
Gettysburg Friday and Rider
Saturday, travel to Pittsburgh
Monday and host Wilkes College
Wednesday.

In assessing her team’s
chances of qualifying for the
regional playoffs, Starr noted,
“The ability to score will deter-
mine how well we do. If the
freshmen overcome their inex-
perience and our defense re-
mains sound, we should have a
chance.”

Cross country team captures [C4A meet

Bisons shock Villanova and the cross country world as Reifs

By ROBBY STETZ
and JEFF CROSS

“This proves to the rest of the
country what we have.”

These were coach Art Gulden’s
remarks after his cross country
team outraced an outstanding 21-
team field on their way to the
IC4A Championship Division title
Monday in New York.

The Bisons, ranked 16th in the
nation before the meet, placed six
runners among the top 22 racers
to finish first with 55 points, spoil-
ing pre-race favorite Villanova’s
bid for a third straight team title.
Tri-captain Jim O’Shea ’81 called
the race ‘‘our best team per-
formance ever.”

Gulden commented, ‘‘We didn’t
seem to be awed by the highly
competitive field. We really
believed we could win.”’ The har-
riers gained additional incentive
when they read a race preview in
the New York Times that failed to
even mention Bucknell as con-
tenders.

12th-ranked Villanova, their
lineup stocked with world class
foreign athletes, managed 79
points for second. Boston Univer-
sity and George Washington
University were distant third and
fourth finishers with 173 and 177
points, respectively.

Equally as amazing as the
squad’s team finish was the third

place individual effort of Bill
Reifsnyder 84.

Reifsnyder was the first
American runner to finish (the
first two were Kenyans) and his

time of 24 minutes, 14 seconds §

over the five-mile Van Cortlandt

Park course set a freshman ,

record.

Mark Centrowitz, the 5,000 meter
champion in the U.S. Olympic
trials this summer, who ran a

24:21 time for Manhattan in the

1973 IC4A meet.

Reifsnyder said, ‘‘I didn’t feel i

any pressure before the race be-
ing only a freshman,” and added
“IT was really pleased with my
performance.”

Solomon Chebor of Farleigh
Dickinson, the fourth place

finisher in last year’s meet, won |

the race in 24:11. Amos Korir of
Villanova captured second place
in 24:13, just one stride ahead of
Reifsnyder. Villanova’s Sidney
Maree, the world renowned run-
ner from Kenya and the winner of
the race in both 1978 and 1979,
struggled to a 21st place effort.

The individual achievements of
the reaming varsity harriers can-
not be overemphasized since

triumph. The Bisons’ second

on goal in final minute by Krupka

When the soccer team surrendered a goal late
in the first overtime period to trail Rider 2-1
Saturday, things looked bleak for the low scoring
booters.

possession in the soccer team’s 2-2 draw
with Rider Friday night. Hassinger scored
his second goal of the season on a spec-
tacular header in the second half._.. . -

The large East Field crowd groaned as chance
after chance went for naught during the second
10 minute overtime session.

The Bisons were on the verge of their fourth
straight loss when co-captain Bruce Marcey ’81
lined up for an indirect free kick with 40 seconds
remaining in the contest.

Marcey lofted a shot toward a crowd of players
in front of the Rider net and the ball was lost
from sight for a moment. Suddenly, John Krupka
*81 got his foot on the ball and sent a shot home to
give the Bisons their second tie against two wins
and four losses.

Goaltender Pete Puccia ’81 remarked. “‘The
goal turned our season from a disappointing one
to a potentially promising one.”

In the first half, the Bisons ‘“‘moved the ball
well” according to coach Craig Reynolds but
couldn’t put the ball in the net and settled for a
scoreless draw at the end of the first 45 minutes.

The second half proved different as Rider
started to take control. Rider tallied the first
goal by converting on a fast counter attack mid-
way through the half.

Soon after, Brian Hassinger ’81 directed a
picture-perfect header past the Rider netminder
off a cross from sophomore Doug Hitchner to tie
the contest.

Rider controlled the tempo in both overtime
sessions but the Bisons received the break they
needed to avoid another defeat.

The booters travel to Lafayette Saturday for
an important match with the Leopards. The
Bisons have a chance to win the ECC West con-
ference title with victories in their remaining
conference matches against Lafayette,
Delaware and Lehigh.

The contest features a matchup between the
two top scorers in the western division.
Lafayette’s George Tiger is the point leader with
four goals and three assists through the
Leopards’ first nine games while Mark Brother-
ton ’83 has five goals and an assist in eight

Tri-captain Sayre noted ‘It
was nice being underdogs,”’ ad-
ding, ‘‘coaches from rival con-
ference teams were yelling for us
even though they had teams
entered.’’ Tri-captain O’Shea
stated, ‘‘I probably ran the best
race I’ve ever run’ in notching
13th spot in 24:57.

Mark Hulme ’83 completed the
Bisons’ scoring by running 25
minutes flat for 18th position.
Freshman Jeff Hines was four
seconds back in 22nd and Glenn
Gibney ’83 finished 41st in 25:28

Mudsharks drop 3

games at Glassboro

Despite displaying skill and
determination in a tournament
at Glassboro State in New Jer-
sey last weekend, the men’s
ultimate frisbee club suffered
losses in all three games they
played.

The Mudsharks had their
work cut out from the start as
their first match was against
Glassboro State, the defending
national champions. the Mud-

sharks were overmatched but
not outclassed, chipping away at
Glassboro’s early lead before fall-
ing 13-9.

The Mudsharks’ second match
of the afternoon, against the
Boston Aero Discs, had the
same result. Captain Mel Bayo
81 stated, “We played well but
they were more patient on of-
fense.” He added, “The wind
really hurt our throws.”

The Mudsharks were pitted

Women’s soccer falls

5-1 in season finale

The George Washington Uni-
versity women’s soccer squad,
“one of the quickest girls teams
I’ve ever seen” according to
coach Pete Puccia ’81, handed
the women’s soccer club a 5-1
setback Saturday. The loss gave
the Bisons an 0-7-1 final record.

After falling behind 4-0 by
halftime, Beth Conboy ’81 put
in a rebound of a long shot
early in the second half for her
first career goal. The proficient
GWU offense soon tallied a fifth
time to bring the final score to
5-1.

Concerning the club’s problem
of unsteady participation and the
lack of a full-time paid coach,
Puccia said, “I hope the enthusi-
asm shown during the season
can be channeled toward the
formation of a women’s varsity
soecer team in the near future.”

Richards places 2nd
in ECAC golf play

Senior co-captains Dave
Richards and Rob Wagner, junior
Mike Stoyla and sophomore Rick
Cramer shot a combined total of
626 to place an unofficial fifth
among the 10 teams in the ECAC
tournament finals held at the
Penn National Golf Club in
Fayetteville Sunday and Mon-
day.

The Bisons’ finish was unof-
ficial because they failed to
qualify as a five man team in the
Southern sectional qualifying
tournament at Bucknell Oct. 9.
The Bisons were the third best
finishers in the qualifying round
but only two teams qualified for
the tournament finals.

Central Connecticut won the
ECAC tournament with a
312-295-607 total, while the
University of California (Pa.)
finished second with 614. Indiana
University (Pa.) and Dartmouth
finished close behind with scores
of 620 and 624, respectively.

Scott Thieualt of Central Con-
necticut had the best individual
score with a 78-69-147 total.

Richards, who finished fifth in
the ECAC tournament last year,

tied for second with 74-75-149.

Cramer shot 78-78-156, Stoyla
managed 78-80-158 and Wagner,
with a disappointing second
round, finished at 77-86-163.

The Bucknell golfers were com-
peting as individuals. The other
competitors sent five-man teams.

Coach Jeff Ranck was pleased
with the play of the Bison golfers,
and said, “If we had had five men
and could play as a team, we
would have had a good chance of
winning.”

N.A.S.L. teams face

financial hardships

No team in the North Ameri-
can Soccer League has made a
profit since the founding of the
league 10 years ago, according
to Commissioner Phil Woosnam.

The Commissioner’s remarks
were made before the com-
mencement of the annual meet-
ing of the N.A.S.L. team owners
Monday.

The New York Cosmos, four-
time Soccer Bowl winners and
possessors of all league attend-
ance records, have failed to

spokesman for Warner Com-
munications, owners of the

with 19 goals in the five games.
Butler had a strong tournament
with 14 markers while Gen-
sheimer scored nine times. Corl

with six.

Goaltender Paxton was once
again superb throughout the tour-
nament, being credited with 48

saves in five games including a
spectacular, rare save of a penal-
ty shot against Slippery Rock.

Bucknell ‘B’, a squad of the

Women harriers sixth as Penn
State wins Bison Invitational

By TOM ELKAS

The women’s cross country
team placed sixth in a 14-team
field with a 154 total at the
Bucknell Invitational Saturday.

Penn State ‘A’ placed five of
the first six runners to win the
meet for the second consecutive
year. The Nittany Lions finished
with 17 points. Cornell was a dis-
tant second with 85 points, follow-
ed by West Chester with 88. In-
diana University (Pa.) and Penn
State ‘B’ also finished ahead of
the Bucknell ‘A’. The Bisons’ ‘B’
team lagged behind with 304.

Heather Carmichael of Penn
State ‘A’ was the first runner to
complete the three mile course
with a 17:46 time. Teammates

Mary Rawe and Patty Menrene
placed second and third with
times of 17:56 and 18:10, respec-
tively.

Jo Burrell ’83 was the Bisons’
top finisher once again, crossing
the tape in 25th place in 19:35.

Laura Gaydos ’83 finished 32nd
in 19:45 while co-captain Linda
Acceturra ’82 and Nancy Nelson
84 tied for 34th in 19:53. Judy

in the 6-5 Bison triumph.

By STEVEN SKOLNICK
and MICHAEL SUAREZ

The Bisons defeated the Golden Rams of West
Chester 31-21 Saturday behind the stellar offensive
performance of left halfback Ken Jenkins ’82.

In amassing 341 total offensive yards, Jenkins
rushed for 146 yards in 23 carries, returned punts
and kickoffs for 87 more, and caught three
touchdown passes for an additional 108.

The teams were deadlocked with three points
each at the end of the first quarter after trading 30-
yard field goals.

On the first play of the second quarter, sophomore
quarterback Al Locey, standing on his own 26,
pumped a 44-yard pass to Ji enkins who gathered the
ball in and sprinted the remaining 30 yards to
paydirt. Senior Alvin Depew’s conversion put the
Herd in front to stay, 10-3.

The Bison offense was soon back in control as out-
side linebacker Jeff Miller ’82 intercepted a Ron
Gaynor aerial on West Chester’s 31-yard line.

Jenkins and Marshall Hall ’83 pushed the ball
down to the one-yard.line where Locey, on a keeper
to the left, tallied the Bisons’ second touchdown of
the afternoon. Depew’s point after touchdown in-
creased Bucknell’s advantage to 17-3.

The game looked as if it might turn into a
Bucknell romp, but with 40 seconds left in the half
Gaynor and his favorite receiver, Bruce Carthon,
combined for a 12-yard scoring play.

Polo wins BU tourney
on score in last second

By JEFF CROSS

The New York Athletic Club
had battled back from 4-2 and 5-4
deficits to tie the Bucknell ‘A’
water polo squad 5-5 with under
three minutes remaining in the
championship game of the
Bucknell Tournament Sunday
morning.

The NYAC knew a tie would
give the championship trophy to
the Bisons since there is no over-
time play under AAU rules and
they trailed Bucknell by nine in
goal differential, the deciding
factor in case of a tie.

Although the Bisons were
assured of first place unless they
surrendered a sixth goal, pride
was at stake. Last year, Bucknell
edged the NYAC 3-2 in the
Bucknell Tournament final and
rallied in the final minute for a 4-4
draw in the AAU Nationals.

Both teams had waltzed to the
finals with decisive victories over
four opponents. The Bisons
crushed Cornell 15-2, Richmond
13-4, the Philadelphia Aquatic
Club 19-4 and Slippery Rock 14-4

version and the Bisons took a 17-9 lead to the locker
room.

On their second possession of the third quarter,
the Bison offense, starting from its own 45-yard line,
drove down to the West Chester 11 behind the
rushing tandem of Jenkins and Hall.

On the next play, Locey rolled out to his left and as
the Ram defensive unit closed in, lofted a pass to
Jenkins on the right side. Jenkins barreled over two
defenders on his way to his second touchdown of the
game.

The Herd went out in front 24-9 when Depew’s con-
version split the uprights.

The Golden Rams were unable to retaliate as the
Bison defense frustrated their scoring efforts
throughout the third quarter.

Early in the fourth quarter, though, West Chester
trimmed the Bucknell lead to 24-15 when Gaynor
found the end zone on an eight-yard bootleg to the
right. Again, the Rams’ attempted two point con-
version failed.

The Bisons responded similarly as Locey and
Jenkins combined for their third score, a 23-yard
pop pass over the middle, advancing the Herd’s lead
to 31-15.

The scoring was finalized at 31-21 when Gaynor
hit Carthon with a 61-yard aerial on the. next series.

Head Coach Bob Curtis, commenting on the slip-
pery field and poor officiating, stated, “‘There were
a lot of uncontrollable factors that went against us. I
was pleased to get the win.”

in the semifinals.

The NYAC trounced Navy 13-6,
Bucknell ‘B’ 18-2, Slippery Rock
10-5, and Cornell 11-1 in the semis.

Goaltender Tony Paxton ’81
commented, ‘‘We knew we had to
play extremely well to win.”

At this point, however, play
grew cautious and neither team
was able to mount enough
pressure to score the decisive tal-
ly. As the clock ticked down to
less than one minute remaining,
the voiciferous capacity crowd in
Freas-Rooke pool grew
noticeably tense.

With three seconds remaining,
the Bisons had time for one final
scoring thrust as they were
awarded possession in their own
zone on a penalty.

Tom Butler ’82 lobbed the ball
in the direction of captain Scott
Schulte ’81 who cut behind
defenseman Homer Lane and in
front of the NYAC goal. Butler
said, “Scott was driving for the
net and I just tried to hit him with
apass. It wasn’t a set play.”

Schulte, the Bisons’ leading
scorer who had been effectively
marked throughout the match,
timed his move perfectly as he
rose out of the water and tapped
Butler’s pass over the head of the
NYAC goaltender and into the top
of the cage.

The clock showed only one se-
cond left as the crowd leaped to
its feet in a frenzied roar. The
Bucknell players mobbed one
another in a scene reminiscent of
the United States Olympic
hockey team’s celebration after
their win over the USSR in the
Lake Placid Olympics in
February.

The Bisons survived another
nail-biter against the NYAC,
perennially one of the major
challengers to Bucknell’s East
Coast water polo supremacy.

The NYAC broke the ice early
in the first quarter of the title
match by scoring on a six on five

penalty situation. However,
Bucknell evened the game when
Dan Inglefield ’82 was credited
with a goal put in by one of the
NYAC’s own players.

Mark Gensheimer ’81 scored on
an assist from Peter Weiman ’81
to put the Bisons ahead 2-1 mid-
way through the second quarter
but late in the half, New York
retied the contest by putting a re-
bound by goalie Paxton.

The fast paced action continued
in the third quarter with
numerous scoring chances for
both squads.

Bucknell broke the deadlock
when Marc Corl ’81 tallied on an
assist from Gensheimer on the
first shot of the quarter and the
Bisons went up by two when
Weiman converted on Gen-
sheimer’s cross pool pass.

Weiman commented, ‘‘We
should have had them beaten
there but we let them come
back.”’ New York dominated the
latter part of the quarter and
scored two goals to tie the action
going into the final seven
minutes.

The Bisons stunned the NYAC
early in the fourth quarter and by
moving in front 5-4 when Weiman
scored his second goal on another
Gensheimer assist.

New York again battled back,
tying the contest by scoring when
Bucknell’s defense became brief-
ly disorganized.

The stage was set for Schulte’s
memorable goal and the Bisons.
had their 16th victory in 17
outings.

The keys to victory according
to Schulte were “not making
mistakes, playing a well balanc-
ed game and being as physical to
them as they were to us.”’ Gen-
sheimer remarked, ‘Intensity
was our biggest asset.”’

Fall break dates kept by most

By MATT KARANIAN

Most students appear to have honored the
scheduled dates for last week’s fall break, neither
leaving school early nor returning late.

This is the conclusion reached through informal
observations by Dean of Student Affairs John
Dunlop and Dean of the College of Engineering
Barry Maxwell.

Dunlop said “no issue” has been made of student
absenteeism immediately preceding or following
the break. He had received ‘‘no complaints” about
persons leaving early, ‘‘and therefore suspected
student attendance was not irregular,” he said.

“T’ve seen or heard nothing to indicate students
have abused the privilege,” Dunlop said.

Maxwell concurred with Dunlop’s observations
saying there did not seem to be a ‘“‘significant dif-
ference” in class attendance in the days before the
break.

He said students ‘(probably made an attempt not
to abuse” the midsemester break dates, since the

break was an experimental part of the academic
calendar.

If the break “gets abused like the Thanksgiving

continuing it.”

On the Friday before the four-day rest period, the
number of students eating lunch in the University
Center cafeteria was considerably lower than the
normal count for Fridays, according to Dining Ser-
vice Director Henry Ross. He said the breakfast
count on that day was “‘a little more than normal,”
however.

Ross said between 800 and 1,000 people normally
eat breakfast on Fridays, but that the count was
1,250 Oct. 24.

The increased number of breakfasts served may
have been a result of plans by many students to
leave for home sometime after that meal and before
lunch, Ross said.

Donald Wise, Jr., 25, of RD 5, Lewisburg, was detained for acts of

Wise was identified as having a history of mental health problems.
He had been released from a mental institution six months ago.

At 4:50 p.m. Friday, Amarante was notified by radio that a man
had been observed tearing the wallpaper from the walls of the Univer-

to the call along with Chief of Security Norman Fine and the East Buf-

January course still
‘ considered as faculty
-, debates requirements

By DAVID HAWKINGS

Debate on a mandatory general
education program for students
in the College of Arts and
Sciences has begun after a
semester’s postponement.

The proposal for a mandatory
January course for credit is still
under consideration.

With the plan by the Cur-
riculum Committee of the college
now in its fourth year of deliber-
ation and revision, committee
Chairman Jackson Hill told the
Arts and Sciences faculty Oct. 29
that the draft now before them
was the group’s “final attempt”
at a compromise pleasing to all
factions of the faculty.

But after two 80-minute
meetings on that date and Tues-
day, the approximately 70 voting
faculty members at each session
had failed to vote on even the first
point of a 13-point proposal.

The vote on the first element of
the latest general education
package — which would mandate
a foreign language requirement
of two courses through the 102
level — was stalled at both
meetings by various amend-

, ments, parliamentary wrangling

and arguments over how to han-
die the length of the debate.

Other parts of the current
general education proposal in-
clude a requirement in
mathematics or logic,
humanities, social sciences and
A

“capstone’’ course would be re-
quired of students in their senior
year, and a ‘“‘common ex-
perience” would also be man-
dated.

The program would supercede
the current scheme of distribu-
tion requirements for students in
the college and a ‘College Coun-
cil” would be established to in-
stitute and sustain all the other
requirements if passed by the
Arts and Sciences Faculty.

Three alternatives for this
“common experience’’ are listed
in the proposal, two of which call
for a credit course in January of
either Freshman or Sophomore
year.

Such a course would require
the approval of the entire Univer-
sity faculty if it is first passed by
the college faculty, because of the
Jan Plan’s status as a program
for the entire University.

But the ‘common experience”’
section of the current proposal is
far down.on the agenda, and as
yet has no scheduled date for
debate in the College of Arts and ©
Sciences.

A mandatory “Jan Plan’’ was
approved by a two-vote majority
of the University faculty at their
February meeting, but the vote
was later discarded on a
technicality. Discussion of the
proposal was later tabled in-
definitely by that body.

At the Oct. 29 meeting, an alter-

Republicans sweep right to major victory

GOP Washington celebration draws thousands

Republican National Committee Chairman Bill Brock, left,
and Senator John Heinz Ill of Pennsylvania appear before
thousands of supporters at an election night victory celebra-

tion in Washington.

By MATT KARANIAN
WASHINGTON—There was a feeling of euphoria
here Tuesday as party faithfuls gathered at the
Hilton Hotel for an ‘“‘Election Night Watch” spon-
sored by the Republican National Committee.

Amid cries of ‘‘We did it! We did it!”’ it became
clear early in the evening that the GOP was
registering victories in contests nationwide for its
House and Senate candidates, as well as a presiden-
tial victory for Ronald Reagan.

RNC chairman Bill Brock addressed the mass of
Reagan supporters in the International Ballroom of
the hotel several times during the evening.

Billing the night as a “new beginning,”’ Brock
called on supporters to ‘make the victory
something that will last for a lifetime.”

“We have done the first part of the job but we
have much left to do,”’ he said.

Brock had warned the crowd earlier that because
“several thousand’’ were waiting at the doors to get
into the ballroom, ‘‘at the moment no one can get in
and no one can get out.”

Hotel officials estimated there were 14,000 per-
sons in the hotel, and that more than 6,500 persons
had packed the International Ballroom to watch as
election returns were reported on the giant screens
in the hall.

The ballroom is designed to accommodate 4,000
persons and was filled over capacity by more than
50 percent. Hilton Conference Coordinator Barbara
Hipp reported the ‘‘fire marshall closed the hotel at
10:30 p.m.” because of the overcrowding.

The New Year’s Eve atmosphere of the evening
began early and lasted through the night. By 8:30

Reagan’s electoral win buries president

By DAVID O’CONNELL

Riding on the coattails of Ronald
Reagan’s sweeping electoral college vic-
tory, the Republican party made major
gains on the national and state level as
voters called for a new conservatism at the
polls Tuesday.

Reagan’s electoral landslide of 489 votes
to President Carter's 49 was backed by a
GOP gain of 12 Senate seats, giving them
control by a 53 to 46 margin over the
Democrats. In addition, the Republicans
gained four governerships for a total of 23.

In the first GOP controlled Senate since
1954, Howard Baker of Tennessee is ex-
pected to become the new majority leader.
In major power shifts, Strom Thurmond of
South Carolina is in line for the chair-
manship of the Judiciary Committee —
now held by Edward M. Kennedy of
Massachusetts — and Barry Goldwater of
Arizona will replace the defeated Birch
Bayh (D — Ind.) as chairman of the Select
Committee on Intelligence.

Powerful Democrats who lost reelection
bids included Bayh, John Culver of Iowa,
George McGovern of South Dakota, Frank
Church of Idaho and Warren Magnuson of
Washington. In Pennsylvania, Phila-
delphia Republican Arlen Specter
defeated Democrat Pete Flaherty by a 52

to 48 percent margin.

The Democrats maintained control of
the House of Representatives by 243 to 192,
although the GOP gained 32 seats. When
the 97th Congress convenes in January, it
will be the first time that one party has not

UPDATE

controlled both houses of Congress since
1916, and women will hold a record 21 seats
in the House.

Opinion pollsters defended their predic-
tions for a close race by saying that most
major polls stopped just as a Reagan
popularity surge began late last week.
They were reluctant to extrapolate late
Reagan percentage gains into a landslide
in the interests of statistical conservatism.

Republicans picked up more than 200
legislative seats around the country, in-
cluding control in key states such as Penn-
sylvania and Ohio. The importance of
statehouse control will be heightened after

p.m. the mood in the hotel had turned from one of
nervous anticipation to one of jubilous celebration.

It was recognized that Reagan had won the elec-
tion and it was not long before speakers addressing
the ballroom crowd here spoke of “‘president-elect”
Reagan.

The hoopla of the night included mocking farewell
salutes to President Carter and the singing of ‘‘Bye
Bye Jimmy’”’ to the tune of “‘Bye Bye Blackbird.”

Carter’s announced concern with his daughter
Amy’s worry of “nuclear proliferation” was a
widespread joke of the evening, with hundreds of
lapels sporting “‘Ask Amy”’ buttons.

A running tally on Republican victories was kept
by RNC officials, who announced favorable out-
comes as they became known. The defeats of
Democratic Senators Birch Bayh of Indiana and
Frank Church of Idaho were met with great fanfare.

Senator George McGovern’s loss was greeted
with mild astonishment as a dream-come-true to
some, and added to the snowballing momentum of
excitement for the evening. McGovern’s talk to the
nation on television was met with a spattering of
boos from the ballroom crowd.

In a subsequent speech to the supporters in the
hall, Brock declared ‘‘We got our country back to-
day.”’ He said he was so happy that he felt like
singing ‘God Bless America.’ Upon this que the
band played the song, and was joined in with the
singing of most of the crowd of 6,500.

The “Victory ’80 Election Night Watch” was
hosted by the RNC in coordination with the
Reagan/Bush Committee, the National Republican
Senatorial Committee and the National Republican
Congressional Committee.

Japan exec. lectures on productivity

By CATHY NAGEL

There is a difference in attitudes between
Japanese and American laborers and the difference
has provided for an increased rate of productivity in
Japan, according to Takeo Shiina, president and
chief executive officer of IBM, Japan, Ltd.

Shiina spoke to a moderate sized crowd in the
University Center Forum October 29 on ‘‘Produc-
tivity and Management Methods” in the United
States and Japan.

“In Japan, everyone is motivated to produce
quality goods. The Japanese prevent the production
of possible rejects by the attitude for quality pro-
duction by the workers,”’ Shiina said.

In the United States, however, he said, “‘there are
stringent inspections to detect rejects.’’ As a result,
Shiina said, “‘there is a decrease in the operation
rate of facilities which leads to higher costs and
decreased production.”

Shiina is a resident of Japan and has worked for
IBM in Japan since June 1953. He started as a plant
manager, and ‘“‘worked his way up” to the position
of president of the Japan based operations in 1975.

He graduated from Keio University in 1951 and
from Bucknell in 1953. He received mechanical
engineering degrees from both universities.

The most important of the reasons for Japan’s in-
creased productivity is government measures,

Shiina said. ‘‘There, the relationship of government
and industry is completely different than in the U.S.
Here, government almost means your enemy.”

In Japan, “the government is one of your part-
ners.’’ It encourages and helps industry to develop
by giving good tax measures and direct subsidies to
corporations, Shiina said.

night before the start of classes Wednesday after

Director of Residential Life Brenda Gordon said
she did not conduct a formal study of student depar-
tures, but said ‘‘most people appeared not to leave
until sometime on Friday.”

She said between 10 and 15 percent of students re-
mained in residence halls during the break.

Residence Directors provided Gordon with
estimates of the number of students remaining on
campus. Gordon said it was an ‘informal observa-
tion” and that she planned no follow-up or evalua-
tion.

But after 20 minutes of discus-
sion on limiting discussion at the

that there would be no formal
limit on debate length.

“JT don’t wish to be strangled by
rules on this,’ Chambers said.
“The point is to have a
reasonable debate.”’

the language requirement with a

ment was also defeated by voice
vote after a debate lasting the
majority of the hour and one-
quarter debate.

Associate Professor of
Chemistry William Scouten at-

tempted all afternoon Tuesday to
separate students in the bachelor
of sciences programs from the
proposed general education re-
quirements, but his attempts —
one of which was a plan to vote
separately on each point in the
package for B.S. and B.A.
students endorsed by the Cur-
riculum Committee as a com-
promise — were all voted down.

Another defeated motion — by
Professor of Education William
Moore — would have removed
candidates for the bachelor of
science degree from the jurisdic-
tion of the program entirely.

The Arts and Sciences faculty
will resume debate with con-
tinued discussion of the foreign
language requirement Monday.

Anthony C. E. Quainton speaks in the University Center Forum
here Oct. 30. The director of the U.S. Office for Combatting
Terrorism said this country is the victim of 40 percent of recent

terrorist attacks.

U.S. is victim of nearly
half of world’s terrorism

By TRICIA KENNEDY

The United States has been the
target of 40 percent of the acts of
terrorist violence committed in
the last decade, the director of
the U.S. Office for Combatting
Terrorism said here Oct. 30.

Anthony C. E. Quainton said
while many of the casualties in-
curred in these 3,300 terrorist
acts were ‘“‘trivial’’ compared to
those caused by other kinds of
violence, they are important
because of the way terrorism is
performed and how it affects
society in general.

Speaking to a group of approx-
imately 150 in Coleman Theatre,
Quainton said terrorists are
regarded with general disap-
proval because their victims are
often innocent people. But ‘ter-
rorism is not simply ‘mindless
violence,”’ he said — it is a sym-
bolic act intended to influence
politics by means of directed ag-
gression.

Sympathy for terrorists has
caused some governments to ac-
quiesce to them no matter how
“barbaric”? their methods,
Quainton said. He stressed the

need for an ‘‘international con-
census” to put pressure against
those governments.

He said there must be a univer-
sal policy for dealing with ter-
rorists’ demands. Only through
cooperation between countries,
Quainton said, can terrorism be
effectively combatted.

Quainton, a former U.S. am-
bassador to the Central African
Empire, spoke on the topic of
“Terrorism and Law-Level Con-
flict: A Challenge for the 1980’s.”’
The lecture was sponsored by the

Amherst ‘Student’ publishing again
after winning additional allocations

The Amherst Student . which ‘‘ceased publication”
Oct. 20, has resumed its regular printing schedule
without missing an issue following an additional

grant of student funds.

The twice weekly newspaper of Amherst College
had its request for $27,500 from the Student Alloca-
tions Committee halved Oct. 15, and Student
Publisher Barry Volpert announced in a front page
story four days later that the paper could no longer
continue to print without the additional funds.

But before the paper’s demise could begin, the
allocations committee rescued it by appropriating
an additional $14,028 for operating expenses.

The Student had run up a debt of $12,000 in the last
year, primarily from the purchase of facilities the
publisher said enabled them to print faster and

A proposal to give the future
presidents of the ABS an
academic credit by current ABS
President John Dzurinko ’81 will
be discussed and voted on by the
Department of Political Science
Tuesday.

If the proposal is supported by
the department, next year’s ABS
president will have the option of
receiving credit for his office
through non-traditional study in
political science.

Dzurinko’s_ proposal, which
calls for making the office of the
ABS president a course, would
include readings of material ap-
plicable to specific programs the
ABS undertakes. It would also re-
quire the president to keep a dai-
ly journal, plan activities with a
syllabus for carrying each one
out and review the University
governance.

These activities would occur
simultaneously with the tradi-
tional duties of the ABS presi-
dent.

Dzurinko would also like to see

the treasurer of the ABS receive
academic credit. He has met with
faculty members in the Depart-
ment of Management, but that
campaign is still in its very early
stages, he said.

Dzurinko also said obtaining
academic credit for extra-
curricular activities should not
be confined to the ABS president
alone. The ABS will be sending
out notices next week informing
other groups about the opportuni-
ty of combining the extra-
curricular with the curricular to
receive academic credit, he said.

“There are a lot of ways of
thinking about education. Educa-
tion is just traditional,”
Dzurinko said.

Dzurinko said if more students
realize the advantages of receiv-
ing academic credit for non-

“more effectively.”

When the student group’s decision not to cover the
debt was announced, Volpert said in an editorial
that a “‘free, unhindered press’’ was being com-
promised and that the paper would therefore be
forced to discontinue publication, making it ‘‘the on-
ly respectable college in the country without its own
student-run paper.”

Other students at the school said the paper was
using its position to force financial support from the
appropriations group, and that they had ‘“‘sensa-
tionalized the issue in order to garner student sup-
port,’ according to another Amherst publication, In

“The paper just blew the thing out of proportion,”
one student said in a telephone interview.

traditional study, student par-
ticipation would rise. There
would be a “‘proper balance’”’ set
between studies and activities
which he said would counteract
apathy and generate new in-
terests.

Reaction to Reagan
election tentative

Foreign reaction to Ronald
Reagan’s election was both
hopeful and tentative.

The Russians attributed
Carter’s defeat to turning from
detente to heightening interna-
tional tensions, and to “breaking
hundreds of campaign promises
to the voters.” They said U.S. -
Soviet relations could be
whatever Reagan wanted them to
be.

Western Europe cautiously
hoped for moderation; the most
exuberant Reagan congratula-
tions came from Britain’s conser-
vative government.

China, which was offended by
previous Reagan policy
statements, reminded him that it
was Nixon’s Republican ad-
ministration that first initiated
cordial relations with Peking.

U.S. might meet

Iranian demands

Carter administration officials
said Wednesday that the presi-
dent could accept Iran’s feur con-
ditions for the release of the
hostages if negotiations to settle

ambiguities were to take place.

Officials said it would be legal-
ly impossible to return all of the
$8 billion in frozen Iranian assets,
but that a compromise where the
control of the assets would be
transferred is possible. The State
Department also hopes that the
hostages might be released
before all the demands are com-
pletely satisfied.

President Carter’s ability to
comply with the Iranian’s
demands without the approval of
Congress is being questioned due
to recent legislation and constitu-
tional principles limiting the
power to set aside private rights
in pursuing foreign policy objec-
tives.

Referendums pass

the state of Michigan — turned
down proposals to lower taxes.

Atlanta holds rally

for slain children

The racially troubled city of
Atlanta held a prayer service
Wednesday to honor the memory
of 15 black children who were
killed or reported missing since
the summer of 1979.

The body of nine year old Aaron
Jackson Jr. was discovered Sun-
day, prompting the rally, which
was organized by Atlanta
religious leaders. Church bells
tolled at noon as part of the obser-
vance.

The Atlanta police have ex-
panded their special force in-
vestigating the killings to 35, but
they have no leads in the case. Ci-
ty officials are angered at what
they termed a lack of support
from the national office of the
Federal Bureau of Investigation.
The bureau has yet to assign full-
time investigators to the cases.

Fall break: home is so different than Bucknell

By TODD G. BUCHHOLZ
Thanks to the ABS and some supportive
faculty, we had a fall break before
Thanksgiving. The break was supposed to
begin on Friday afternoon.

But who can concentrate on statistics or
English when your ride is leaving in an
hour? We all have priorities — and pack-
ing takes precedence over professors, I
guess.

Coming home is always a thrill. But I
think my family has adjusted to seeing me
only a few times a year. This past visit
caught them off guard.

I was greeted by my dog Jasmine—who
didn’t recognize me. She growled and
snarled and leaped for my jugular vein.
Now I know how the paper boy feels.

Mom was real hospitable too. After
about five tries she got my name right.
“Oh it’s, uh, Scott, no it’s Jill, Jasmine, let
me see your driver’s license —ah,
welcome home Tedd.”’

She adapted to my presence very quick-
ly, though. Pretty soon I was taking out the
garbage, walking the dog (who still didn’t
remember), and driving the car to the
store at 1 a.m. so my little brother could

THE
BUCH
STOP

have his milk in the morning.

Dad enthusiastically embraced my
brother and asked him to introduce me.
When informed that I was his middle son
he too made up a list of chores.

Bucknell is so different than life at
home. In four days I had to break habits

that had been ingrained in my mind. tor
instance, I couldn’t accept the idea of
eating without standing in line for an hour,
so I asked my family to enter the kitchen
single file.

Luckily my brother has some ticket-
punching experience.

Of course, dining without trays also
seemed strange. And I couldn’t resist the
urge to group my silverware together on
the left side of my plate when I was
through.

When I went to bed that night, I stared at
the ceiling and walls of my room.
Something was missing. Something cold,
something with lines. I thought harder.
“‘Ah-hah,”’ I said, ‘Cinder blocks, green
cinder blocks.” How could I sleep
peacefully without institutional . green
cinder blocks lining my cell?

Though cinder blocks were missing, I
did realize one advantage. A very attrac-
tive, alluring and seductive amenity:
television.

Here at Bucknell, there’s no time for TV.
So far this year I’ve watched only three
shows: the Johnny and Ronnie debate, the
Jimmy and Ronnie debate and McHale’s
Navy, while I did my laundry. Obviously I
like comedy.

The television at home, however, has
mystical powers. Magically, my desire to
study economics, political science and
statistics was dissolved. My desire to
watch Johnny Carson and boxing was ig-
nited. After all, nobody knows more about
politics and economics than Johnny Car-
son.

Recall the way he negotiated a
multimillion dollar contract by threaten-
ing to quit — there’s social contract
theory, personal income analysis and
statistics combined!

Sorry, professors and administrators,
but for the price of watching Alpo commer-
cials and tolerating Ed McMahon’s obse-
quious laugh, I can get an education. And
the University wants to raise tuition $1000?
I’ll stick with Johnny and stay at home,
even if my dog doesn’t remember me.

The United States’ limited “respectability spectrum”

In the United States; however,

within which the United States
operates. The diagram shows this
spectrum.

Every country has its own uni-
que political ‘respectability
spectrum,” i.e., the generally ac-
ceptable philosophical
parameters within which the
political institutions effectively
operate and which are accepted
as norms for that society. For ex-
ample, in France, the spectrum
runs from the communist left to
the ultra (reactionary) right, and
the political campaign is so struc-
tured as to effectively allow an
airing of all views. The voter can,

three positions as liberal,

but all three are rightest in the
absolute sense, with little to
limited faith in the role of govern-
ment as an active regulator of
our economic and social life.

There is an effective void in the
U.S. from the absolute center to
the left, with token but ineffectual
representation by the Socialist
Party, the Socialist Labor Party,
the Workers World Party, the
Communist Party and the
Socialist Workers Party.

Our two main political. parties

~“poth cover the spectrum from

Brad Thomas

Ronald Reagan from the far right
(reactionary).

In 1932, there was a sharp
swing to the moderate right
(liberal), and, until this past
Tuesday, the presidential elec-
tions were between moderate
right (liberal) and center right
(conservative) candidates. The
significance of Tuesday’s vote
was that for the first time since
1932 there was no liberal can-
didate running for president,
there were two conservative can-
didates (Carter and Anderson)
and one reactionary (Reagan),
with the reactionary candidate
winning.

In a period of economic uncer-

tainty, inflation, high unemploy-
ment and a resurgence of anti-
U.S. feeling abroad leading to
paranoia, there was a malaise
and uncertainty rampant in the
American electorate. The radical
right joined the scared tradi-
tional liberals — blue collar
workers, ethnics, etc. — and con-
servatives to give the election to
Reagan.

In terms of the three R’s of
politics the voters, in a period of
frustration and uncertainty, re-
jected both Reform and
Radicalism for the Reactionary
alternative. It was very reminis-
cent of a similar, though more ex-
treme, phenomenon that oc-
curred in Central Europe in the
early 1930s.

In the worst possible of
scenarios, during the next four
years we will witness: a) an end
to detente, leading to confronta-

and a return to the cold war and
b) a period of internal social in-

tion feeling increasingly
frustrated by the Reagan ad-
ministration’s emasculation of
much of the progressive or refor-
mist social and economic legisla-
tion developed over the past 40 to
50 years.

This could lead to riots reminis-
cent of the 1960s and a counter-
demand for “law and order,”
which in four years could lead to
a further movement to the right,
which would lead to ... see

Factions and finesse

The push for curricular reform in the College of Arts and
Sciences has returned to the floor of faculty, but already it appears
the latest compromise plan may be doomed to crumble under the
weight of the group’s factionalism and parliamentary finesse.

The plan for a set of general education requirements within the
larger of the two colleges here—and the call for a “common ex-
perience’’ course to be taken in J anuary—is a version of the docu-
ment which has been getting steadily weaker since it was first pro-
posed almost four years ago. And as the program has been watered
down, the spite between the “‘arts’”’ faculty and their colleagues in
the ‘‘sciences”’ has become increasingly potent.

We obviously find disappointing and discouraging the lack of
willingness on the part of the faculty to engage in what Dean Robert
Chambers calls ‘reasonable debate’ on these issues. The point of
the first two annoyingly stagnant meetings this fall seems to have
been who could most thoroughly stump faculty parliamentarian
Richard Peterec; likewise, natural sciences professors tried first
and foremost to remove their degree programs from the rubric of
the proposed general education guidelines.

Thorough and cooperative debate is sorely needed if the college
is to finally take a firm step toward an appropriate educational
future, and we strongly encourage all faculty members to put aside
their departmental prejudices and discuss the plan objectively. If
this is done, no length of discussion could be called unproductive.

Wading into journalism

Two weeks ago, when the Amherst Student almost ceased
publication due to a lack of funds, an outraged editorial in that
publication declared that no community can be free unless it is in-
formed.

On campus, the college newspaper is the lifeline of communica-
tion between students, faculty and administration. It provides a
necessary forum for student expression, information and education.

When we bustle around the basement of Roberts Hall each week
to publish the results of our inquiries, interviews and editing there is
one recurring problem for which we can offer no positive answer.
Neither the sea of student apathy nor the lack of academic credit or
recognition severely hinders us. We’ve stemmed that tide before,
although sometimes a bit waterlogged.

Our frustrations lie in the shallow puddle which the University
has provided us. There are no courses in journalism, and there ex-
ists every reason why there should be.

The English department would greatly enhance its curriculum if
it offered journalism courses. The expository writing practiced and
learned by a good course in journalism would provide a tool to
enhance the students’ methods of inquiry and perception. Jour-

nalism is elementary and intrinsic to writing, communication and
education.

English Professor Ralph Rees, unhappy with one of our
editorials, vehemently suggested in a letter to the editor last week

that the University hire a “professional” to teach students jour-
nalism.

We’ve said the same thing on this page for years and we urge the
University to act immediately.

Following your rules

Judging by informal observations by the deans and the Dining
Service, student attendance in class did not fall off considerably
before and after fall break last week. Perhaps we have realized the
only way to keep a good thing is to prove it can work in the spirit in
which it was approved by the faculty.

Unfortunately, we have heard from many students that the
faculty did not totally keep with that same spirit; some professors
cancelled their classes or had teachers substitute for them so they
could leave early.

Remembering the amendment attached to the break’s approval
one year ago which said that attendance is “required both of the
faculty and students’ and that ‘‘no classes may be cancelled without
prior approval of the dean or provost,’’ we hope the faculty will not
set the stage for a double standard. The laws of fall break must be
meticulously followed to insure its permanence.

Power can be a terrible thing

To the Editor:
Power is a terrible thing. It can

turn an undergraduate liberal

arts student into a New York
Times-caliber critic who God
Himself wouldn’t be ashamed of
checking with before attending
His next movie or show. It can
allow an editor to overstep his
professional boundaries in an at-
tempt to refute a reader’s com-
ments.

More importantly, however,
when it is abused, power can turn
a critic into a hypocrite. I think
we have all seen an excellent ex-
ample of this in the last two
issues of the Bucknellian.

Based on the overwhelming
number of positive responses that
I heard both during the show and
in conversations later on during
the week, I was shocked to read
the anonymously-written review
of Bucky’s Place which appeared
in the October 17th issue of the
Bucknellian.

The author faulted Eagles for
“encouraging the crowd to be ex-
tremely quiet, then extolling
them to ‘raise the roof six inches’
with cheers and applause.” This
apparently ‘‘insulted the au-

Brockhaus

responds

To the Editor:

I was somewhat taken aback —
and, if politics were not so
serious, I would have been
amused — by the vehemence
with which the Reagan fans at-
tacked me. I stated at the top of
my piece that it was directed not
at Ronnie’s folks (since trying to
talk someone out of voting for
Reagan is probably like trying to
talk him out of having syphilis),
but at those who were thinking of
voting for Anderson. These latter
were strangely silent.

I will leave it for the logicians,
as an exercise, to criticize Mr.
Caragher’s claim that my article
commits ad hominem abusive;
the weight of my argument (ap-
parently too much for Mr.
Caragher to bear) was, as I
pointed out, directed not at
Reagan voters but at Anderson
voters.

Mr. Buchholz’ droll comments
on politics I will also leave for
others, but it is worth pointing out
that I don’t feel guilty for my
stupid vote in 1968 but just dumb;
guilt has no place in education.

On second thought, I cannot
resist one self-indulgent com-
ment on Mr. Buchholz’ piece. If a
vote for Reagan is a vote against
government regulation (I am, in-
cidentally, touched by his faith in
the Invisible Hand), then why is it
that the Teamster’s Union decid-
ed to back Reagan because they
were angry at Carter for
deregulating the trucking in-
dustry? Things are just not as
simple as they seem in Disney-
land.

dience’s intelligence.” First of
all, our aim in_ organizing
Bucky’s Place was not educa-
tional.

If someone’s intelligence was
insulted, we had no qualms about
their leaving so they could go
back to their rooms and study.
We could have used the vacated
spaces to seat the 200-plus people
who had to stand.

Secondly, I may be wrong, but
from my vantage point it looked
to me as though the audience did,
in fact, become extremely quiet
and did try to ‘raise the roof six
inches.”

If sloppiness in the show was a
problem, then let’s consider the
magnitude of the show that was

presented. Bucky’s Place provid- .

ed five hours of entertainment
which more than 2,000 people at-
tended. Four different acts per-
formed and more than 75 people
were involved in the production
and execution of the evening.

You just can’t witness a quality
show like the one we prrsented
anywhere else—and we did it
with no admission price. When

you put things in perspective, we

think the show came off with very
few hitches indeed.

The anonymous critic thought
that the level of professionalism
went down considerably after Jon
Sprout’s act. Well, to the best of
my knowledge, the singing

To the Editor:

Bucknell University, as Bar-
ron’s College Catalogue states, is
supposedly of a “‘highly com-
petitive” nature. Why, then, do
we find so many items of
Bucknell paraphernalia printed
with the word ‘‘Bisons’’ on them,
when, in fact, there exists no such
word? The plural of “‘Bison’’ as
can be found in Webster’s Col-
legiate Dictionary, is ‘‘Bison,”’
not “‘Bisons,”’ just as the plural of
“sheep” is ‘‘sheep.”’ I find it sur-
prising that a university of
Bucknell’s prestige would allow
such an embarrassing error to go
by unnoticed. Talk about
“Romper Room Rejects. . .’”

professionals. They were just
students just like you and me and
I thought they did a fantastic job.

Professionalism is a good point
to end on since it seems to be a
point on which we have a mis-
understanding. It just so happens
that there is an excellent exam-
ple of unprofessionalism in the
last issue of the Bucknellian. Get-
ting the last word is one thing, but
placing an editor’s note at the
conclusion of someone’s letter in
order to reinforce your position
and discredit the letter-writer’s
opinion is a farce. But, that’s not
the best one. The editorial enti-
tled “Living with Criticism”
seemed to me to be an attempt by
the editors to refute criticism
that was aimed in their direction.
How hypocritical can you get? I
only hope you wrote that ‘‘tongue-
in-cheek.”’

What is the upshot of this
letter?—probably two things.
First, I guess it means I can’t
take negative criticism. Second-
ly, however, I think it is impor-
tant to realize what a little bit of
power (the ‘‘power of the press’’)
can do to us. Reviews that appear
in this paper are really nothing
more than one person’s opinion.
In fact, they belong on the opin-
ions’ page and not the arts’ page.
I think we should begin to realize
our our qualifications and then
limit our writing to that level of
professionalism. It makes much
more sense this way.

Don’t give credit
where it’s not due

To the Editor:

I question the validity of John Dzurinko’s recent proposal that the
ABS President be allowed to receive academic credit for holding
that position.

While rewarding the holder of this rather important and time-
consuming office with academic credit would certainly be an
honorable, and possibly appropriate action, I question whether
such a move would establish a precedent for a drastic rise in the
number of extracurricular student activities that would demand
academic recognition.

There are surely several students who hold extracurricular posi-
tions of responsibility who feel that their jobs are at least as deman-
ding and educational as that of the ABS President. One immediate-
ly thinks of the rather un-subtle barb by the Bucknellian in the arti-
cle about Dzurinko’s proposal: Why shouldn’t section editors of the
Bucknellian receive academic credit? Of course they should .. .
their commitment and what they learn surely warrant it.

But what of other ABS officers? The managers of the radio sta-
tion? The BJRE directors? Student conductors of the band and
chorale? Those with major positions in Cap and Dagger produc-
tions? Fraternity presidents? The list could go on and on, and
would rapidly enter the realm of the ludicrous.

Many, if not all of the students on this campus who are leaders in
extracurriculars would assert that these activities make up an in-
dispensible part of their college education.

If the University sets a precedent of expanding academic credit
to, for example, the ABS Presidency, I can foresee other student
activity leaders believing that they also deserve academic recogni-
tion.

After all, one must remember that extracurricular activities are
extra-curricular; they are in addition to, not a part of, the regular
academic program of the University. They are to supplement what
one learns in the classroom, not replace it.

There is no shortage of talented, motivated Bucknell students to
fill positions in our many student-directed organizations. In fact,
the large number of high-quality student-run organizations is one of
the most impressive facets of Bucknell life.

To grant academic credit for a few of these positions would, out of
fairness, necessitate granting credit or some other form of
academic recognition for all. Any thinking person should be able to
visualize the Pandora’s Box of problems, demands, and potential
abuses that such a course of action could perpetuate.

Odyssey of producing a theatrical set
combines hard work with creativity

By LYNNE RUTHERFORD

The Cap and Dagger production of Moliere’s Tartuffe, which ran
last month, owed much of its Baroque atmosphere
and elegant staging to the set design of F. Elaine Williams, visiting
assistant professor of theatre and English. The course of how this
set was built, from William’s first conceptions to the play’s final
performance, represents a convergence of several forms of art, in-
cluding painting, sketching and costume design.

After receiving her appointment last spring, Williams paid a visit
to Lewisburg in June to both look for an apartment and meet with
Harvey Powers, director of the University Theater.

“At this time, Harvey was also formulating his ideas on the play.
We spent an evening discussing our ideas and gaining a basic ap-
proach to Moliere,” said Williams.

The pair’s initial discussion of Tartuffe brought the basic theme
of the covering and uncovering of hypocrisy to the forefront.
Williams underlined this theme in her set.

In the beginning of the play, the stage was austere, with all the
typical Baroque ornaments absent. As Tartuffe’s hypocrisy was
unmasked, however, servants added these ornaments and restore
the earthy and dramatic nature of the period.

Williams said that because it was difficult to determine when the
exact plan of the set became fixed in her mind, she was open to sug-
gestions from her surroundings.

“The shape of a bush or a sculpture, anything that interests you,
can effect the final design,” she said.

“This set was unusual in that it contained nine different en-
trances. A focal point was needed for grand entrances and exits,
and the top of the staircase provided it,”’ she added.

To prepare herself for designing Tartuffe, Williams extensively
researched France during the reign of Louis XIV, particularly the
castle Versailles and the court life there.

Theater. Last year’s Stratford ShakespereanTheater poster
is prominently displayed.

After this research, Williams organized her ideas into a series of
preliminary sketches, which she presented to Powers. After these
were finalized, she began a floorplan and mapped her design to
scale.

Finally, Williams constructed a model of her set. A crew of'about
20 students then began work on Sept. 17. These students worked
four to five hours per day until the week of the show, when construc-
tion was in progress virtually around the clock.

Due to limited time and lack of crew hands, Williams was forced
to modify her design slightly.

“My only regret is that the set was not as fully realized as I in-
tended it to be. There wasn’t enough time to totally finish some
details,’’ she said.

The Baroque period also was created in the furniture and
costumes chosen. Fortunately,a table and chairs from Hunt
Hall proved close in design to the period and were transported to
the theater.

Williams made preliminary sketches of ideal versions of all the
costumes and then rented all but three of them from Brooks Van
Horn, a New York costuming firm. The rest were constructed by
Peg Hornberger ’83 and members of the costume crew.

“I was very pleased with the costumes. Generally, we were able
to find clothing of the period,” Williams said. ‘“The house designer
(of Brooks Van Horn) allowed us to look through their stock and
select the ones that came closest to my designs.”’

Williams said if time had been sufficient, it “would have been fun
to construct the costumes ourselves.”

« After the four-day run of Tartuffe the set was dismantled, or
struck, within a few hours, but Williams was not saddened by the
demise of her handiwork. ‘‘That’s the nature of the theater. It was
just for four performances, and each of them was different.
Nothing remains the same for long,”’ she said.

Professors fulfill need for expression
through clippings on their office doors

By LYNNE RUTHERFORD

Where do your professors find creative fulfillment? Not always
lecturing to 100 students, or grading essays. A stroll through the
corridors of Coleman Hall, Vaughn Literature and other academic
buildings yields the answer: many professors most vividly express
themselves through clippings on their office doors.

“I take great pride in my door,” said Ben Marsh, assistant pro-
fessor of geography. ‘It’s an expression of myself.”

Marsh’s door includes a picture of a man holding a pig. It also ap-
pears to be the most autobiographical.

“It’s me—the boy with a dog syndrome,” said Marsh.

Generally, professors ' clippings can be divided into, three
categories: those making an important personal or political state-
ment, those expressing likes and dislikes and those placed on the
door just for fun.

Included in the first category is the door of Eric Schutz, assistant
professor of economics, located at 221 A Coleman Hall. On it is
posted a photo of Eugene Debs, the 1912 presidential candidate who
garnered more than 1 million votes on a Socialist Party ticket.

“It’s to make students aware of the Socialist Party, and to ask
themselves who Eugene Debs was,” said Schutz.

In common with several other professors, Schutz included a car-
toon denigrating T.V. “I just hate it,” he explained.

Also attempting to make students more aware of important
political issues are the clippings of Tom Travis, associate professor
of political science, located at 201 D Coleman. Featured prominent-

ly on his door is a picture of a highly appetizing hamburger.

“It’s there to make students consider their own eating habits, in
contrast to the rest of the world, a third of which is starving,” said
Travis.

In contrast to the more highly-minded clippings, severa: other

professors use their doors to publicize likes and dislikes, or just to
have fun.

Among this group is Kar] Patten, associate professor of English.
His door, located in the Wilbur Smith Memorial Library, displays a
sign reading ‘‘Occupied, Occupied, Occupado.”

“It’s there for the fun of it, and because I believe in language,”
said Patten.

Harvey Powers, in keeping with his post of director of the Univer-
sity Theater, displays a poster of the Stratford Shakespearean
Festival.

“Whenever a new poster comes along that I like better, I make
the switch. I didn’t like this year’s Stratford poster, so last year’s is
still up,”’ said Powers.

Professors also appear able to poke gentle fun at themselves. The
door of Elaine Williams, technical director of the theatre, posts a
cartoon with the question, ‘“‘Don’t you think the entire idea of sets
and costumes is vulgar?”’

Countless other instructors sported an array of clippings arrang-
ing from the simple to the bizarre. So the next time you need an in-
sight into how your professor’s mind works, make a close examina-
tion of his or her door.

Craft shop provides stu¢

By DAVID BLACKMAN

Feeling uncreative lately? Lost in a world of
books and blackboards? The answer to your pro-
blems lies hidden on the first floor of the Univer-
sity Center in the place on campus where
students may go and create decorative and
useful items in many artistic mediums.

Under the direction of supervisor Molly Ross,
the Craft Shop allows both the interested
amateur and the experienced craftsman a place
to practice his trade. A schedule of classes rang-
ing from quiltmaking to furniture refinishing is
offered each semester and is open first to
students, faculty and University employees, then
to interested outsiders. Some students in the
courses have come from as far away as Danville
and Bloomsburg.

With reasons ranging from “I’m making a pre-
sent for my roommate” to “I’m replacing a
sculpture that my mother broke,” or simply for
the pleasure and accomplishment of working
with their hands, many students have been
drawn to the craft shop.

Some of the most popular courses at present
are basketry and calligraphy, along with the
always full jewelry and ceramics courses. The
beginning drawing and painting course has been
particularly successful, giving the shy and inex-
perienced artist a chance to learn basic skills.

is the new course in medieval brass rubbing.
This traditional English art of tracing plaques
onto paper has found a recent upsurge in

Ross. The plaques used are fascimiles of actual

wilt 80, learned the art of silk screening and now
prints and sells his own T-shirts. In addition,
fraternity and sorority members have found the
wood burning kilns in the shop useful in such

The limited space of the craft room could be
seen as a hindrance to the growth of courses, but
this is not the case. Organization of supplies is
precise and students are required to replace and
clean up all materials used. This is the only
restriction placed upon them, as admission to the
shop is free.

With new programs added every year, the
Craft Shop has so far managed to gauge the
preferences of students correctly. They plan to
expand even further in the future.

The Craft Shop is open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
and 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. Monday thru Thursday and
1 p.m. to4 p.m. on Sunday.

The Kung Fu Club’s Shih-Hu-Chaun emblem symbolizes the
art's three main characteristics: spontaneity, simplicity, and
directness.

The art in Kung-Fu
is stressed by club

The average person’s expectations of the martial arts has been
formed by Kung Fu movies: fantastic twists, lethal kicks and im-
possibly high jumps come quickly to mind. Yet in reality, the
University’s Kung Fu Club pursues an entirely different form of the
martial art.

“We stress Kung Fu as an art, not a sport. Martial means war,
art means creativity. We stress the artistic aspect in our
teaching,” said Vergel Blake ’82, treasurer of the club.

“Movies vastly exaggerate the art. They portray Kung Fu totally
differently than it is in real life,” added Blake.

Kung Fu originated in ancient China as a form of exercise.
Although it is an art form, the primary function of Kung Fu re-
mains self-defense. A disciplined student never uses his skills
unless attacked first, according to Blake.

“Kung Gu is based on the principles of love, harmony, and peace.
You don’t hurt anyone unless you have to,” Blake said.

The club, sporting 20 to 25 members, meets formally Tuesday
and Thursday in Tustin Gym. During this time, lessons are given.
In addition, two informal practice sessions are held per week. To
become ranked and work toward a black sash, students must at-
tend at least two sessions each week. Jim O’Donnell ’81 is the club
teacher.

The group has already held one exhibition on Parent’s Weekend.
They plan to perform during halftime at this year’s basketball
games in Davis Gymnasium, and are scheduling a special exhibi-
tion for second semester’s Celebration of the Arts Week.

Kung Fu not only develops physical discipline, but mental
discipline as well, according to Blake. The club engages in medita-
tion before practicing Shu Chu Chaun, an improvisational form of
Kung Fu devised by Leon Trescott ’80, founder of the club. A syn-
thesis of all branches of the Martial Arts, it incorporates techniques
into a shadow-boxing type of format.

Writers assembled at University
for fourth Annual Poetry Festival

By MARJIE GELZER

Tuesday evening marked the beginning of the Universi-
ty’s fourth Annual Poetry Festival, held each fall to
both local and nationally-known poets the opportunity to
present their works and to celebrate the art of poetry.

The first of these gatherings took place in 1977, ac-
cording to Professor of English Karl Patten, one of two
coordinators of the program. In January of that year, Pat-
ten explained, he and Professor of English Robert
Taylor—the other coordinator of the festival—agreed that
both students and faculty needed more exposure to
poetry.

To achieve this goal they became co-editors of West
Branch, a twice-yearly literary magazine of poetry and
fiction. When the first edition came out that fall, Patten
and Taylor decided to celebrate its publishing by present-
ing an open reading of all the poetry in the magazine.

Robert Mayer and Barbara Ross, both of Lewisburg,
perform Wednesday with Metamorphosis.

They invited the poets whose work was included in the
publication to appear and the assemblage was so suc-
cessful that it developed into an annual event.

The principal sponsor of the Bucknell Poetry Festival,
Patten said, is the Committee on Poetry Readings and
Special Lectures of the English department. An important
part of the budget, though, comes from alumni organiza-
tions such as the Association for the Arts at Bucknell, and
from the Pennsylvania Council on the Arts.

“We must be doing something right,” Patten said,
because the council has generously increased its contribu-
tion to the festival every year over the last four years.

This year’s festival is the most extensive one ever
presented here, according to Patten, because the coor-
dinators wanted more than just a weekend of poetry—they
“‘wanted ro really celebrate.”

The five-day program started Tuesday evening in the C.
Willard Smith Memorial Library—where all the festival’s
activities are slated to be held—with a poetry reading by
students. This portion of the festival was organized by the
students themselves, Patten said. e

“We want to encourage their participation,” Patten
said, ‘‘since the festival is especially for the students.”

Metamorphosis, a performing group from Lewisburg,
gave an unusual presentation of performed poetry
Wednesday evening. The company’s aim, according to
director Joel Gori, is to look at poetry in different ways.
Metamorphosis is an improvisational group that performs
mime and pantomime using poetry for narration.

The performers also examine the transformation of
poetry, Gori said, by completely breaking down a poem
and looking at it from different angles.

Thursday afternoon four faculty members—Patten,
Taylor, Associate Professor of Russian and Linguistics
Robert Beard and Professor of English Jack Wheatcroft—
participated in the festival by reading selections from
their own poetry and fiction.

The major event of this year’s poetry festival is a
reading at 8 p.m. tonight by 14 guest poets. Each writer
has published works in West Branch and several of them

Poetry Festival.

have participated in the three previous festivals.

The program will culminate Saturday in a full day of ac-
tivities, including a series of readings from West Branch,
readings by the guest poets, an open reading and
workshops with the visiting poets.

Patten put special emphasis on the 10 a.m. workshops
and encouraged writers from the campus and the com-
munity to bring their works for discussion. People can
learn a great deal, he said, by watching the poets ‘‘zero in
ona work” and find its strengths and weaknesses.

The annual poetry festival is important to other univer-
sities, as well as to Bucknell, Patten concluded.

“We don’t know of any other campuses that do these
things,” he said. ‘Since it’s in the fall we like to think of
the event as a harvesting festival—one in which everyone

shares a rich, abundant crop of poetry.”

Artist Anna Sofaer, discoverer of an ancient Indian calendar, will

| present an interdisciplinary colloquium entitled ‘Consequences of

Discovery: Ancient American Indian Culture in Conflict with the
Present” in Vaughan Literature Auditorium at 7:30 p.m. Monday.

“The idea for the program grew out of my scientific writing
class,” Associate Professor of English Catherine Smith, organizer
of the colloquium, said. ‘‘We’ve been discussing the site for three
years and interest in it keeps growing.”

English 201B, the Bucknell Student Lectureship Committee and
the art and economics departments are sponsoring the program.

The principal object of discussion will be an assembly of leaning
stone slabs and carved spirals found in Chaco Canyon, New Mexico
by Sofaer. Constructed by the Ansazi Indians several thousand
years before the birth of Christ, the assembly acts as a primitive
calendar.

Sofaer, who stumbled upon the site three years ago while survey-
ing the canyon, will discuss both the artistic and scientific
significance of the site as well as the conflict it raises in commer-
cial development of the canyon. There are major deposits of
uranium, coal, oil and natural gas in the area.

“We're dealing with the question of the responsibility of a culture
that discovers another culture’s form of art,” Smith said. The
American Indian Religious Freedom Act of 1978 protects sacred In-
dian sites and guarantees tribal religious freedom.

Sofaer is now president of the Ansazi Project, an organization
devoted to preserving the canyon basin. In addition to the calendar,
the canyon contains thousands of other examples of Ansazi rock
art.

Included among the anthropologist’s finds so far in the Chaco are
intricate road networks for trade and transportation, as well as
fairly advanced irrigation systems. These discoveries, along with
the calendar, provide evidence of a complex and culturally rich
civilization. However, further development of the area’s abundant
natural resources threatens the exploration and understanding of
the Indian culture.

Lecturing with Sofaer will be Thomas Buckley, a cultural an-
thropologist specializing in native American culture. He will
discuss the responsibility to preserve ancient cultural sites. Both
speakers will present slides of the canyon and other an-
thropological finds.

provides hymns on alternating Sundays and helps lead the congregation during every service.

Chapel Choir is singing a new tune
as McGahan conducts restructuring

By ROBIN MEREDITH

After 18 months of internal turmoil and tem-
porary foundering, a new Chapel Choir is rising
under the leadership of Visiting Assistant Professor
of Music Christopher McGahan.

The Chapel Choir now numbers 26 members—a
marked increase from the 17 person group inherited
from Professor of Music William McRae who
directed the ensemble from the 1940’s until his
retirement in 1979. McGahan called the past year
and a half ‘‘a transition period” during which he has
transformed the choir from a “schizophrenic group
that didn’t know where it was going” into one able
“to provide service music of the best possible kind
for the University chapel.”

“People become used to the old way,” Steve
Kushner ’82, the group’s manager, said. “It’s just
human nature that they find it hard to adjust.”

Many people who were not satisfied with the choir
under McRae’s direction rejoined the group last

year, according to McGahan. Most of them were
seniors, though, which left this year’s choir made up
almost entirely of freshmen.

There has been a tremendous turnover of choir
members since the group came under the new
director. McGahan is of the opinion that this
signifies the demise of an old image, and the plant-
ing of seeds for a new group with incentive and “‘a
sense of striving for cogent musical goals.”

McGahan said he hoped interest would ‘‘spread
like mustard seed,” although he added that bigger
is better only if all members are interested in work-
ing hard toward ‘“‘the sense of community that is at
the heart of musical experience.”

The Chapel Choir, according to McGahan, is mov-
ing in a positive direction and looks to bigger and
better years ahead.

“We haven’t died,’ he said. ‘“We’re just
experiencing a period of transition—rebuilding a
true Chapel Choir.”’

Photographers aim

for a new approach

Joseph Ruszkiewicz ’82, acting
head of the Photography Club,
has changed the club to make it
more educational than it has been
in the past.

Ruszkiewicz said he saw pro-
blems because the club has been
used mainly as a darkroom facili-
ty and, although some people
were learning from them, others
kept repeating the same
mistakes. Levels of darkroom
proficiency, he said, were not in-
creasing at an appropriate pace.

The problem was caused by a
lack of instruction, according to
Ruszkiewicz. In an effort to cor-
rect the discrepancy, he began of-

fering advice to those using the
room.

This informal lecturing led to
the planning of a January Pro-
gram to be taught by
Ruszkiewicz and Tom Hayowyk,
a senior at Fairfield University in
Fairfield, Conn. The Jan Plan
will cover all areas of
photography — from such basics
as how to hold a camera, to film
developing and tips on improving
the quality of a print. The cost of
the program will be $60-65.

Ruszkiewicz said he hopes that
because of his educational pro-
gram, there will be a higher
caliber of student photography at
the University. He said his future
goals include at least one exhibit
next semester and perhaps a
photography contest in the
spring.

Gold album sterling listening

‘Music for Flute and Strings by Three Americans’ hailed as

By PAM TAYLOR

Diane Gold, lecturer in music
here and part-time faculty
member at Juniata College and
Pennsylvania State University, is
featured flutist on the album
Music for Flute and Strings by
Three Americans, released by
Leonarda Productions Inc. this
summer.

Even for those who know
nothing of flute and string music,
the album is a delight to listen to.
Aided by the Alard String
Quartet, Gold has produced a
technically fine example of con-
temporary music that provides
an excellent reproduction of in-
strumental sound.

“Theme and Variations” by

of six alterations on the basic

DU captures intramural soccer .

By LEE LEWIS

This fall’s intramural soccer season was
characterized by close games and exceptional
talent, a trend which continued throughout the
playoffs to culminate in a thrilling final game. The
outcome of the championship game was a surprise
to many, but was well earned and proved a fitting
ending to an exciting fall.

When the season began Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity
was the favorite to win the season title and the
playoff crown. Led by many former junior varsity
soccer players, Phi Psi breezed through their first
five games with little or no problem.

It was the sixth game of the season which provid-
ed the only tarnish on Phi Psi’s record. A hard
fought 1-1 tie with Delta Upsilon Fraternity
foreshadowed a tough future battle for those two
teams.

After the tie, Phi Psi won their last three games to
enter the playoffs as the number one seed. They sur-
vived a scare against Kress Underground when
they trailed 1-0 with 10 minutes to go before rallying
to win 4-1.

Then came the semifinal game against the
Shadow II, one of the preseason favorites to reach
the finals. Playing with only nine players, the
Shadow, led by goalie Chris Petermann 81, gave
Phi Psi all it could handle before falling 2-1.

DU had a tougher time during the regular season,
struggling at first, but rounding together toward the
end of the campaign. Buoyed by quick goalie Stu
Berger ’81 and leading scorer Tom Wilkins ’82, DU
edged Kappa Sigma and Phi Gamma Delta Frater-
nities and the Shadow early in the year. Hard fought
ties with Kappa Delta Rho Fraternity, Harry’s Bar
and Grill and the aforementioned game with Phi Psi
were the only blemishes on DU’s record.

DU had an easy task in the first round of the
playoffs, outclassing the Endless Knights 4-0.

The semifinals didn’t prove as easy, however, as
DU battled KDR for the right to enter the finals. The
regulation time ended with a 0-0 deadlock, and since
neither team tallied during the two overtime
periods, the outcome came down to penalty kicks.
In the darkness and cold of late afternoon on Oct. 29,
DU outshot KDR 4-2 to win the game.

Before an estimated 200 people Friday, the two
top teams of the intramural soccer season battled it
out to see who would capture the championship.

Throughout the first half both teams played
defensively, not wanting to make a fatal mistake.
The only real scoring opportunity came when Phi
Psi goalie Oscar Crews ’83 attempted to cut off a
long DU pass intended for Wilkins. Wilkins beat
Crews to the ball, but his shot rolled just wide and
the first half ended in a scoreless tie.

As the second half developed, Phi Psi started to
take control, led by intramural all-stars Jim
Kingman ’81, Bob Dalton ’80, and John Colligan ’80.
Phi Psi peppered the DU goal, but fine defensive
play by all-star John Zaharchuk 81 and superior
goaltending by Berger prevented any scores.

About 10 minutes into the second half, DU got the
big break of the game which provided the margin of
victory. Winger Larry Esposito ’82 took a clearing
pass at midfield and led Wilkins with a pass up the
middle. Wilkins dodged junior fullback Rich
Brooks, and was able to get around goalie Crews
and push the ball between the posts at 34:21 of the
game.

At that point, DU sat back on defense and
tenaciously held the lead. Steadied by Zaharchuk,
Berger and Bill Evans ’81, DU managed to reject all
of Phi Psi’s bids to tie the game, and clinched a 1-0
victory.

Olson in Nationals race

By JEANNE MINAHAN

Indiana University of Penn-
sylvania hosted a_ three-mile
cross country war Saturday: the
EAIAW Championship race.
Seventy-six runners from nine
teams fought to the top 15 spots
and the honor of advancing in the
AIAW National Championship
race Nov. 15 in Seattle.

Freshman Judy Olson passed
four opponents in the final half
mile to finish 14th in 19:35, quali-
fying for Nationals, to guide the
Bisons to a sixth place finish. The
harriers finished seventh in the
event last year. Boston College
outdistanced West Chester and
Villanova for the team title.

Jo Burrell ’83, the leading
Bucknell runner in every meet
this season, could manage only a
34th place time of 20:18. Coach
Diane Ware noted ,‘Jo’s muscles

were tight the entire race.”
Teammate Linda Accetura ’82
finished right behind Burrell in
20:20.

Completing the squad’s scoring
were Laura Gaydos ’83 and
Karen Flanagan ’84 who finished
40th and 47th in 20:35 and 20:42,
respectively. Freshmen Deb
Passmore and Nancy Nelson also
ran for the team, finishing 61st
and 63rd, respectively.

Olson, commenting on the most
impressive showing of her
career, said, ‘We talked about
the race beforehand and decided
that we had to want it more than
others.’’ Olson outkicked her op-
ponents to move from 19th to 14th
place in the final half mile. She
added, ‘While I was running,
someone shouted to the girls in
front of me that they were 17th, so
Ihad to try and I did it.”

Soccer blasts Pitt 5-0; loses 2

By BOB DAVIS

“When it rains, it pours” is a fitting way to
describe the soccer team’s play this past week,
which began with a 2-1 loss at Lafayette Oct. 25 and.
ended with a 2-0 setback to the Blue Hens of
Delaware Saturday.

Sandwiched between these was a 5-0 thrashing 01
Pittsburgh at home Wednesday. The victory, which
was one of the brighter spots in the Bisons’ 3-6-2
season, marked Craig Reynold’s 100th win as head
coach.

The Lafayette game was basically a replay of any
of this season’s one-gnal losses. Despite collecting
15 shots on goal, the Bisons managed only one
score.

Co-captain Bruce Marcey ’81 popped one past the
Leopard netminder at 12 minutes of the second
half. The goal only served to tie the score, however,
as Hans Van Yperen had given the Leopards a 1-0
lead 19 minutes into the first frame.

The knot was untied just four minutes after
Marcey’s tally when leading scorer George Tiger
notched what proved to be the winning goal for
Lafayette.

According to Reynolds, the Bisons’ inability to
convert opportunities into goals has plagued the
team all season, costing them more than a few
games.

The booters appeared to have the problem solvec
when they returned home to face Pitt Wednesday

The Bison offense performed like a well-oiled
machine, connecting on five of their 16 shots en
route to blanking the Panthers. 4

Junior forward Brian Hassinger kicked things off
for Bucknell at the 12:45 mark of the first half, tak-
ing a Duncan Lee ’83 pass and sending it into the net
from six yards out.

Lee picked up another assist along with Mark
Brotherton ’83 when they combined to feed team-
mate John Krupka ’81, who did the honors at 17:39.

Freshman Pete Mullany made it 3-0 with a six-
yard boot with 28:16 gone in the half on an assist to
Andy Sayles ’84.

In the second half, the Bisons picked up right
where they left off, as Hassinger registered his se-
cond goal of the game after only 7:10. Senior Co-
captain Pete Christian’s penalty kick with 7:21 left
rounded out the scoring for the Bisons.

Junior Paul Green recorded the shutout with
some fine goaltending, turning back 15 shots.

Unfortunately, the magic wore off prior to Satur-
day’s game at Delaware. The Blue Hens used a pair
of goals by Mike Walters to send the Bisons home
with a 2-0 defeat.

The booters, meanwhile, could generate only 10
shots on goal, while goaltender Green faced 17
Delaware bids.

The booters face rival Lehigh at home Friday at 7
p.m. and close their season at Elizabethtown Tues-
day.

Field hockey team gains
second seed in EAIAW’s

By ROBBY STETZ

The field hockey team con- -

tinued its late season surge by
recording victories over Indiana
(Pa.) University, Wilkes College
and University of Pittsburgh in
the past two weeks.

The trio of victories extended
the team’s season-ending win-
ning streak to five straight, thus
capping a complete turnaround
from a midseason 2-4 mark.
Bucknell closed the regular
season at 8-6-1, with a 6-0-1 ledger
over the past seven games.

The strong performance in the
final half of the season has
earned the squad a second seed in
the AIAW Division II Regional
Tournament at Loyola College in
Baltimore this weekend. Coach
Sally Starr said, ‘I’m happy to
see that we’re seeded so high, this
shows that our program is well
respected.”

the top three finishers qualify for

the AIAW National Tournament
Nov. 19-22 at Southern Illinois
University in Edwardsville.

Bucknell opens against seventh
seeded Drexel today. Their op-
ponents have a scrappy squad
that cannot be taken lightly, ac-
cording to Starr. ‘They are a
tough team and capable of the
unexpected. We have to be up for
this match.”

The Bisons lost to top seeded
LaSalle 5-0 Oct. 4 and fifth seeded
Lafayette 2-r a week later but
edged third seeded Lehigh Oct. 18
and eighth seeded Pitt Oct. 27 by
1-0 and 2-0 margins, respectively.

The team closed out its regular
season last Friday with a 1-0 vic-
tory at Indiana (Pa.) University.
The winning goal was scored by
Jeannie Minahan ’83, her third
tally of the season, on a penalty
stroke.

On Oct. 29, the squad gained its
seventh victory with a 2-0 blank-
ing of Wilkes. The Bisons
dominated the action, out-
shooting Wilkes 16-5.

Bucknell goal scorers were
junior co-captain Anne Kennedy
and Maria Procopio '83. Kennedy
has four goals this fall and Pro-
copio three.

Earlier in the week, the squad
benefitted from a_ tie-breaking
goal by Nancy Dill ’84 with 9:30
left in the game to defeat Pitts-
burgh 2-1. The goal was Dill’s sec-
ond of the game and sixth of the
season, a team high.

The Bisons outshot Pitt 16-14
and goalie Betsy Doyle ’82
registered nine saves.

Lehigh crushes Bisons 13-0 as fumbles prove costly

By ERIC HOERNER

BETHLEHEM, Pa. — If the
gridiron had been dry, the foot-
ball game between Bucknell and
Lehigh two Saturdays ago prob-
ably would have been an offen-
sive battle.

The nationally third-ranked
(Division I-AA) Engineers came
into the game as the sixth-ranked
passing team in the nation in
their division and had the East’s
top passing combination in
quarterback Larry Michalski and
split end Mark Yeager. The
Bisons offense featured Ken
Jenkins ’82 as the nation’s
leading all-purpose runner.

However, except for the final
five minutes, the game was
played in a steady rain with
gusting winds. The horrendous
playing conditions caused the
game to be a defensive struggle
and Lehigh sloshed its way to a
13-0 triumph to stay unbeaten at
5-0-2.

The Bison defense turned in a
fine performance in holding the
potent Engineer offense (averag-
ing 380 yards per game) to only

198 yards total.

Defensive tackle Peter Mauritz
’81 earned Honorable Mention as
ECAC I-AA Defensive Player of
the Week for his efforts while
defensive back McKinley Norris
81 limited Yeager to only one
reception.

Offensively, the Bison’s prob-
lem was holding onto the ball.
Lehigh’s hard-hitting defense and
the wet conditions combined to
force Bucknell to fumble 11
times, eight of which they lost.

Bucknell began the afternoon
by losing the coin toss for the
seventh consecutive week;
however Lehigh elected to kick
off.

On the first play from scrim-
mage, Al Locey 83 recovered his
own fumble for a 3-yard gain.

Ken Durr ’82 punted two plays
later to begin a kicking contest
which lasted the rest of the
quarter.

The Bisons fumbled four times
in the second quarter and two of
the miscues led to scores by the
Engineers.

First, Jenkins bobbled the ball

at his own 26-yard line to lose his
first of four fumbles. However, no
damage was done as the defense
held.

On the next series, the Herd ran
one play before Jenkins fumbled
again. This time Lehigh drove to
the 1-yard line, but the defense
nabbed Lehigh halfback Ed God-
bolt for a loss on third down, and
the Engineers had to settle for a
Ted Iobst field goal to open the
scoring.

The gridders lost the next two
fumbles inside their own 15-yard
line. While the first Engineer
possession ended with a missed
field goal, the second resulted in
the only touchdown of the game.

With 15 seconds remaining in
the half, Michalski lofted a pass
toward Yeager in the endzone.
Norris went for the interception
but slightly misjudged the ball as
it passed over his fingertips and
Yeager had his ninth score of the
year to up the count to 10-0.

The weather improved slightly
during halftime, but the third
quarter was another punting
duel.

Gridders win, amassing 5 TD’s

line on their first series. A short
Dowdell punt gave the Herd
possession on the midfield stripe.

The Herd kept the ball on the
ground and on a third-and-three
situation from the Big Red seven-
yard line, Jenkins burst through
a gap in the line to cross the goal
line for his second score. Depew’s
point after put Bucknell ahead 26-
10.

The Bisons gained excellent
field position for the second time
in the quarter when inside
linebacker Durr snared a Mike
Ryan aerial and returned it 10
yards to the Cornell 42.

The running of Jenkins and
Zenda and a Hughes pass to Rich
Passerotti 82 brought the Herd to
the Cornell five where Jenkins
took it in for his third touchdown

Depew’s conversion upped the
score to 33-10.

Cornell found the end zone once
more on a 1-yard Bob Muha run
in the middle of the fourth
quarter to finalize the scoring at
33-16. However, the excitement
was not complete as Bison fans
knew a history-making feat was
soon to occur.

With a first-and-ten situation
from the Cornell 26, Hughes
handed off to Jenkins who burst
through a hole created by the
right side of the offensive line.

When the Big Red defense pulled
Jenkins down he had gained the
three yards needed to give him
1,000 yards for the season.

It was a feat not seen in
Memorial Stadium since 1951
when Brad Meyers and Burt
Talmage both ran for over 1,000
yards. Jenkins is only 70 yards
away from shattering the single
season rushing record of 1,069
yards set by Myers in 1951.

Jenkins earned Honorable
Mention ECAC I-AA Offensive
Player of the Week honors for his
performance.

The five touchdown offensive
performance prompted Head
Coach Bob Curtis to comment,
“The backfield is solidified.”

Hughes, recovered from a
recurring knee injury, started his
first game this year as the Bison
field captain. Curtis remarked,
“Eddie had the confidence that
he could get in there and get the
job done. He showed potential.”

Curtis continued, ‘‘Our offense
and special teams had to come
through because our defense has
not been up to par. Both of those
phases came through.”’

Herd rolls over Big &

Red behind Jenkins

By STEVEN SKOLNICK
and MICHAEL SUAREZ

Junior halfback Ken Jenkins rushed for
158 yards and three touchdowns in 25 car-
ries as the Bisons defeated Cornell 33-16
Saturday.

After taking the opening kickoff, at their
20-yard line, the Bisons wasted little time
in getting the offensive machine in high
gear. Bucknell pushed the ball to their own
34-yard line where it first appeared the
drive was going to falter.

With the Big Red defense shifted into a
seven-man front for the third-and-one
situation, quarterback Ed Hughes ’83 pit-
ched the ball to Jenkins. As his backfield
partner, Steve Zenda ’83, knocked the Cor-
nell cornerback down, Jenkins exploded
around the right end and streaked down
the sideline on a 64-yard scoring sprint.

Senior Alvin Depew’s conversion at-
tempt failed and the scoreboard showed a
6-0 Herd lead with less than four minutes
elapsed.

“The boys up front did a helluva job,”
said Jenkins. ‘‘The holes open up and I get
through them. We work like a well-tuned
machine.”

When Cornell took the ensuing kickoff
and drove inside the Bucknell 15-yard line,
it looked as if the game might turn into a
scoring battle. However, their drive came
up short and the Big Red had to settle for a
24-yard field goal by Ron Rejda that cut
the Bucknell edge to 6-3.

Neither team showed any offensive zest
in the second quarter until Ken Durr ’82 set
up the Herd by booming a 70-yard punt

Water polo fal

that rolled dead on the Cornell 6. The Herd
defense stuffed Cornell for three plays to
force a punt. Dave Kucera ’84 took Scott
Dowdell’s punt on the Bucknell 46, starting
moving towards the right sideline and
when Ed Stark ’82 threw a block to spring
him free for a moment, Kucera was off on
a 27-yard return.

Three plays later Hughes rolled out to
his left, then cut back when he spotted a
seam and scampered through the middle
of the Cornell defense for. a 20-yard
touchdown jaunt.

The Bison offense could only rest for two
minutes as the stalwart defense again
stymied the Big Red in four plays. This
time, however, Dowdell never got the punt
away as Jenkins buried him when Dowdell
bobbled the snap from center.

Jenkins and Marshall Hall ’83 moved the
Bisons down to the 1-yard line where Hall
vaulted over a pile on second-and-goal to
hit paydirt. Hughes’ pass to Jenkins for a
two-point conversion failed and Bucknell
was out in front 19-3 with 4:41 left in the
half.

Cornell countered with a 72-yard
touchdown drive on the next series.
Fullback Ben Tenuta carried for 63 of the
yards on three carries including a 16-yard
touchdown run. The conversion closed the
score to 19-10 but neither team was able to
score again before the half ended.

“We just ran out of gas” was
the way water polo coach Dick
Russell described it. He was
referring to the fifth place finish
his team recorded at the AAU In-
door Championships held last
Friday through Sunday at Brown

University in Providence, R.I.

In “easily the most competitive
tournament we’ve been in all
year” according to Russell, the
Bisons were seeded second and
riding an 18-game winning
streak. The 16-team field includ-
ed archrival New York Athletic
Club and the Industry Hills and
Malibu club teams from Califor-
nia.

tournament was not only

competitive but also a grueling
test of endurance. The Bisons
played seven games in three
days, a pace that cost them dear-
ly in their matches with the
established water polo powers
entered.

The Bisons opened the tourna-
ment action with a 21-2 rout of Ar-
my Friday morning as captain
Scott Schulte 81 pumped home
eight goals and Mark Gen-
sheimer ’81 added four and Tom
Butler ’82 three.

Malibu, a California-based club
team, composed of alumni of
Pepperdine University, the
defending NCAA champions, took
to the pool against Bucknell Fri-
day night.

The Bisons jumped to a 5-2 lead
by ‘“outswimming them badly”

according to goaltender Tony
Paxton ’81. However, Malibu
began to ‘“‘counter on our counter
attack” noted Paxton, and by
converting on four of five
breakaways and one penalty
shot, tied the contest as time ran
down.

Dave Myers then won the game
for Malibu with less than 30
seconds left by firing home an
outside shot. Paxton remarked,
“He has an awesome shot — one
of the best in the country.”

The Bisons rebounded early
Saturday morning with an 11-2
runaway over Queens College
and then faced a crucial en-
counter with the NYAC Saturday
afternoon. The team knew they
needed a win to move into the
playoffs for championship con-

tention.

The Bisons led 5-3 late in the
game, just as they had on their
way to a last-second 6-5 victory in
the final of the Bucknell Tourna-
ment Oct. 19. This time, the
NYAC scored twice on rebounds
in the last minute to earn a tie.

Paxton commented, ‘‘It was a
very disappointing game. We
seemed to let down at the end.”
Russell added, “Each time we
were ahead, we made key
mistakes — mistakes due to
fatigue — and lost those leads.”

Chances to move into the final
four were gone. Last year, the
Bisons finished second in the
same tournament, losing only to
Pepperdine by 12-6 in the final.

The Bisons had to come right
back with a game Saturday night
against Brown, an Eastern power
the squad had edged 6-5 in the
opening game of the Brown Tour-
nament Sept. 26. On this occa-
sion, though, the result was not as
close as Bucknell rolled to an 11-5
triumph.

The weekend odyssey con-
tinued Sunday morning with a 12-
4 victory over Fordham, one of
the top teams in the East and win-
ners of the Mid-Atlantic League
championship last season.

The final game of the tourna-
ment Sunday afternoon pitted
Bucknell against Loyola of
Chicago for fifth place. The
Bisons scored a 9-5 win over
Loyola to capture fifth place in
the NCAA Championships last
November in Long Beach, Ca.

The Bisons fell behind by 3-0
despite “‘totally controlling the
game,” according to Paxton.
“We were so exhausted that we
couldn’t get anything on our shots
— about six of them hit posts.”

ters in AAU’s with fifth place finish

Yet, the Bisons battled back to
eventually draw even at 3-3 on
two goals by Schulte and one
from Gensheimer. Bucknell even
had a chance to win the game
with 10 seconds remaining but
Schulte’s shot hit the post.

After seeing his team’s high
aspirations dashed by lack of
depth and some tough luck,
Russell nonetheless was far from
disappointed. ‘‘The kids gave it
everything they had,” he said.

Paxton noted, “We were close
but we just couldn’t put those
games away. We know we’re bet-
ter than a lot of those teams.”’

Industry Hills knocked off
Malibu to win the championship
Sunday.

Schulte, who scored 35 goals in
the seven games, was named
AAU All-American for the second
straight year. He was the only
collegian chosen for the 11-player
team.

Receiving honorable mention
on the All-American squad were
Gensheimer, who scored 13 goals
and 15 assists, and Paxton, who
had 57 saves while allowing only
28 goals against outstanding com-
petition. Gensheimer was also an
honorable mention choice a year
ago.

he Bisons take their 23-2-2
record to the MAL champion-
ships this weekend at Fordham.
Last’ season, Fordham upset
Bucknell 9-8 with a goal with 40
seconds remaining to capture
first place.

Fordham is the only team ex-
pected to challenge the water
polo squad for the title. The
Bisons need to finish in the top
two to qualify for the Eastern
Championships at Syracuse Nov.
14-15.

$1,115 tuition hike proposed

Increase

By MADELON HENEHAN

The latest in a series of proposals for an
increase in tuition and fees called for a
$1,115 hike. The details of the proposal
were released Friday.

According to this fifth proposal for the
1981-82 school year, comprehensive
charges would increase 15.23 percent. A
fifteen percent wage and salary increase is
also allotted. If this proposal is approved,
the comprehensive cost for one year here
would be $8,436.

This version, dated Nov. 4, was discuss-
ed at a meeting of the Finance Committee
of the Board of Trustees on Nov. 7. At this
meeting the current budget was reviewed
and guidelines for the upcoming budget
were discussed.

“We didn’t attempt to arrive at a
specific decision,” Vice-Chairman of the
Finance Committee of the Board of
Trustees, Andrew Mathieson, said.

One item that was ‘agreed upon by all

parties was that we should never allow the
scholarship portion (financial aid) to
decrease as the cost of Bucknell in-
creases,” Mathieson said.

A $950 tuition increase, a $65 room fee
hike, and a $100 rise in board fees is the
breakdown of the $1,115 comprehensive
charge hike proposed.

“This is by no means a final copy of the
budget. It could go up, it could go down,”
according to Chairman of the ABS Finance
Committee Richard Pisano ’82. The four
previous proposals show a possible hike
range of $879, as listed in the second pro-
posal, to the most recent and drastic in-
crease of $1,115.

According to Vice President for Ad-
ministration and Finance, John Zeller, the
probable range of increase is now “a
minimum of $900 to a maximum of $1,115.”
Zeller said he “doubts very much” that
there will be a tuition and fees hike of more
than $1,115.

amounts to 154% more than current charge

Whether an increase of this extent will
cause a drop in enrollment is “always a
cause of concern,” Zeller said.

The committee assumes other colleges
will increase fees by a similar amount. Ac-
cording to Zeller, it is estimated that other
colleges in Bucknell’s ‘‘frame of
reference” will go up approximately
$1,000, “with a leeway of a few hundred
dollars.”

“As long as the University’s fees are not
out of line with other schools and family
ability to pay, no problems should arise,”
Zeller said.

The budget will take the ‘wisdom of
job” to balance said Mathieson. One
obstacle in determining it is the unpredic-
table rate of inflation and the degree of
emphasis that must be placed on it.

“Inflation should not be used blindly, but
as one of a number of factors,” according
to Mathieson.

Speculating on an estimated 10 percent

inflation rate, Pisano estimated next
year’s Freshmen would be paying $13,000
for their education here for their Senior
year.

Students and faculty gather Thursday for a meeting of the
Bucknell Progressive Caucus at Carey House. The caucus
calls itself a liberal organization which is “diametrically
opposed” to conservatism.

Progressive group seeks
support among rightists

By MARC ELLIOTT

Organized progressivism has returned to Bucknell after a long
absence, in the form of a student-faculty group called the Bucknell
Progressive Caucus.

The new organization bills itself as “a group with a vision of for-
ward change,” and promises to be a viable political alternative to
other political student organizations here, among them the Young
Americans for Freedom, a right wing club.

“Progressivism means that you’re not interested in maintaining
the status quo just because it is the status quo,” Schutz said. “We
want to present to the campus community and to the larger com-
munity, progressivism as a political orientation. It’s going to be lef-
tist, ranging from radical to leftist liberal.

University plans a $50 million

capital campaign,

By GREG HAHN

The largest capital giving cam-
paign in Bucknell history is in the
planning stages, according to
University President Dennis
O’Brien.

A drive to collect $30-50 million
is scheduled to begin in either
1982 or 1983, and reach maturity
in 1987.

The five to six year quest to in-
crease the University endowment
will consist of a ‘broad scale,
general campaign” directed
toward ‘alumni primarily” and
also toward ‘“‘friends of the
University, major foundations
and corporations,”’ O’Brien said.

Allocations have yet to be made
for the gifts the University ex-
pects to receive. A “principle
amount of funds will be used for
the central academic purposes of
the University—for academic
facilities, for endowment, for pro-
fessorships and for scholar-
ships,’’ O’Brien said.

Although additional space for
the library ranks as the highest
priority for University projects
now, O’Brien said any new pro-
jects would depend upon the
“availability of funds and on the
desires of the major sources of
the funds.”

Lower down on the priority list
for improvements to the Univer-
sity’s physical plant are major
improvements to facilities for the
sciences and the arts.

About 50 percent of the money
raised is expected to go toward
capital improvements, with the
other half being used for
strengthening the endowment, in-
creasing the number of endowed
professorships and supporting
other academic programs.

The plan for raising the money
was first officially discussed at a

meeting of the University Board
of Trustees in May, but the
amount and the campaign have
been in the earliest planning
stages since the Sports/Recrea-
tion Center fundraising was con-
cluded in the fall of 1978.

Vice President for University
Relations John Ferguson took his
12-man staff on a “planning
retreat” Oct. 23 and 24 in State
College as part of the “early, pre-
planning stages of the cam-

largest ever

paign,”’ Ferguson said.

Funding for the two-day, $800
conference called by the new vice
president came from sources out-
side the University’s budget,
Ferguson said.

According to O’Brien, the cam-
paign’s maturity date of 1987 was
chosen because 100 years earlier,
in 1887, the name Bucknell was
chosen for the institution former-
ly known as the University at
Lewisburg.

Members of the ABS congress voted Tuesday to petition University President Dennis O'Brien

to consider its proposed plans
floor.

for the completion of the University Center's vacant third

ABS petitions for flexible use

of University Center's top floor

By SUSAN MACDONALD

The Association of Bucknell Students called Tues-
day for the completion of the vacant third floor of
the University Center petitioning University Presi-
dent Dennis O’Brien with plans for the use of the
space.

The statement said a completed third floor could
draw revenue for the University, and this revenue
could help pay some of the expense of construction.
“Income producing” is seen as an integral part of
the proposal, and would result from use of the
rooms on the floor by outside groups.

O’Brien, who is on University business in Califor-
nia until Sunday, was unavailable for comment.

The plans for use of the space — prepared by the
ABS Student Life Committee — stress the ‘‘flexible
use” of the space to meet both student and Universi-
ty needs.

The proposal calls for the largest of the available
areas of the floor to become a “commons” area,
with a small kitchen. It is proposed this area “sup-
plement and complement”’ the cafeteria.

The space could be used to serve special menus,
or to accommodate students with “fast passes,” the
report said. It could also operate as a reception or
party area for large groups.

The room in which the Center Gallery art exhibit
is currently housed should become a casual reading
and conversation area to supplement Wall’s
Lounge, according to the proposal.

The area facing Moore Avenue, on the uphill side,

has ‘“‘several possibilities” for use, including space
for storage, as an art gallery, or as a base for the
Office of Career Services, now' housed in the
Carnegie building.

These rooms could also be used during the sum-
mer for seminars, the report said.

A northern room facing Moore Avenue on the
downhill side may be employed as a seminar and
conference area, or as a Classroom with the remain-
ing space separated by movable partitions to suit
different groups.

The ability to accommodate “outside groups’’
was a major factor in determining the plans for the
third floor. The University is ‘‘much sought after”
as a conference location, and conferences here have
generated “‘over $400 thousand” in revenues for the
University this year, according to the ABS report.

One of the reasons for the timing of Tuesday’s
proposal for the vacant third floor is the upcoming
Board of Trustees’ meeting in New York City Dec.
6-7. The ABS approval of the plans make them a for-
mal suggestion to the trustees from the students.

The UC third floor has remained unfinished since
the building was constructed in 1970. Vice President
for Administration and Finance John Zeller said a
“Jack of funds” has prevented the completion of
construction on the floor.

The ABS said in its statement to O’Brien however,
that the “funds required to complete the floor will
be far less than amounts needed for new construc-
tion.”

gets tentative OK

By DAVID HAWKINGS

Amid cries of ‘‘Let’s just vote
one part through” and after a
walkout by six voting faculty
members, the College of Arts and
Sciences Monday tentatively ap-
proved a foreign language re-
quirement for all future students
in that college.

But although the 57 members
still present at the end of the
meeting in the University Center
Forum gave approval to the re-
quirement 28-23, the mandate will
not go into effect as presently
written unless the faculty later
votes to accept the entire plan for
general education submitted by
the college curriculum commit-
tee.

The approved section of the
committee’s plan — the first part
of a 13-part package of curricular
reform would require all
undergraduates to have profi-
ciency in a foreign language
through the 102 course level.
Students would be able to ‘“‘test
out” of the requirement with a
score in the upper 400s on the
Educational Testing Services
achievement tests, however.

Two amendments by Chairman
and Professor of Modern
Languages Allan Grundstrom
that would have raised the level
of the language requirement by
two course numbers failed 30-23.

The language requirement por-
tion of the plan was the first to be
voted on by the faculty, but the
vote was not taken until the clos-
ing moments of another 80-
minute debate filled with anger,
frustration, spontaneous fili-
pustering and a long list of
amendments.

The most significant amend-
ment of the afternoon — and the
only one to pass on the floor —
was proposed by Associate Pro-
fessor of English John Murphy
and stipulates that the faculty
debate the merits of each of the 13
points, vote on them tentatively
and then consider the package as
the whole.

The amendment also called for

prepared to reimburse the University for the costs of duplicating, “use
of the machine should be reserved for official University business.”

The abuse of the copying machines and postage metering has not
been “widespread,” however, according to Muchler.

ROBERT CHAMBERS

the consideration of the so-called
“Tarpy-Chambers”’ proposal, an
alternative plan for general
education requirements by Pro-
fessor of Psychology Roger Tar-
py and College of Arts and
Sciences Dean Robert Chambers.
The plan is a modification of a
plan rejected by the curriculum
committee in 1977.

After both plans are con-
sidered, the Murphy amendment
calls for choosing one or rejecting
both. The Tarpy-Chambers plan
has no language requirement, not
does it have a component for a
mandatory course for
underclassmen in January, and
is considered by many to be a
more loosely constructed ap-
proach to curricular reform.

Chambers said in an interview
Thursday that the ‘‘more open-
ended way of approaching the
same values” than the curricular
committee’s plan was the Tarpy-
Chambers’ principal advantage,
but he also acknowledged that the
looseness of the structure might
appease many of the faculty in
the sciences and education who
are trying to defeat the current
plan on the grounds that it is too
constricting to their highly struc-
tured curricula.

Meeting of radicals

draws lar

By MARC ELLIOTT

The first meeting of the newly-
formed Bucknell Progressive
Caucus was held Oct. 30 at Taylor
Street House. A standing-room-
only crowd of nearly fifty
students and faculty members
was present to meet the group’s
founders and learn something of
the organization’s structure.

Andy Brody ’81, a co-founder of
the BPC, acted as “‘facilitator’’
for the meeting. The BPC has no
president; the term ‘‘facilitator”’
is borrowed from the anti-nuclear
activists, and denotes that person
who sets the agenda and runs the
meetings.

Eric Schutz, Assistant Pro-
fessor of Economics, another co-
founder of the BPC, explained the
group’s development from its in-
ception under the guidance of
Steven Stamos, Associate Pro-
fessor of Economics, who is on
leave from the University. The
other founding members of the
BPC—Charles Sackrey, assistant
professor of economics, Kar] Pat-

ge crowd

ten, professor of English; Jim
Castle ’81, Thomas Trimble
’82—each spoke briefly.

An informal discussion follow-
ed, covering a wide range of con-
troversial issues, from employee
unionization and curricular
reform at the University to inter-
national political issues. Student
and faculty input was en-
thusiastic and geared toward fin-
ding a practical way to imple-
ment progressive activism on
campus.

Former ABS president Phil An-
drews ’81, called for a “‘two-
pronged approach of action and
education,’ and suggested the
group petition the ABS to gain
recognition as a _ sanctioned
University organization.

The ‘‘working statement” of
the BPC states that the organiza-
tion ‘will work for economic
justice, political freedom, equal
rights, self determination for all
peoples and a reversal of the
ever-increasing trend towards
militarism.”

said.

The origins of the BPC are
rooted in the Citizen’s Party Jan
Plan which Professor of
Economics Steven Stamos spon-
sors. It was then, said Schutz
that the establishment of a pro-
gressive group at Bucknell was
first discussed, by a small group
of students and faculty. ‘For a
semester, nothing came of it,
however,” he said. In September
Schutz gave a presentation of the
Citizen’s Party at a meeting of
the Economic Society, and ‘“‘a
great deal of discussion ensued.”’

“At this point, the idea of a pro-
gressive caucus was translated to
reality,’’ Schutz said.

Aid policies are made

clearer in past year

By DAVID 0’CONNELL

The appointment of Ronald
Laszewski as director of financial
aid in October 1979 has resulted in
a clarification of aid policies and
increased efficiency of opera-
tions, according to Provost
Wendell Smith.

“There has been some
misunderstanding of older aid
policies due to changes in the of-
fice and its policies,” Smith said.
“In the past year these policies
have been clarified, counseling
has been increased, and record
keeping has been improved,” he
added.

The provost’s office has direct
responsibility for the financial
aid program. The Board of
Trustees, the Admissions office,
and the faculty committee on
Financial Aid share in the policy-
making.

“Binancial aid is now being
discussed in a more specific man-
ner,” Laszewski said. “We try to
identify the problems of connec-
ting the most needy students with
available money in the most effi-
cient way,” he said.

Laszewski, who previously
served as assistant director of
financial aid at Vassar College,
said he concentrates on data
more than expressions of pure
philosophy. He said that Bucknell
has “traditionally had an insuffi-
cient aid program overall,” and
that it will take time to make im-
provements.

Historically, the University has

Food fast today to

The Association of Bucknell Students food fast to
benefit UNICEF today is expected to raise $1360 ac-
cording to ABS President John Dzurinko ’81.

At press time, 1167 meals had been ‘‘donated”’ to
the food fast effort to help bring drought relief aide
in Africa, Dzurinko said. This is the fourth time
students have fasted here since last year to benefit
oppressed and underpriviledged areas of the world.

“By doing without today,” Dzurinko said, “we
feel to some degree what more than a billion people

feel daily.”

aided an average of 50 percent of
the admitted freshmen who were
judged to be in need. According to
Laszewski, the competition has
been doing better. Schools such
as Colgate, Lafayette and Lehigh
are able to offer aid to 70 to 80
percent of those who need it.

Smith said that the Universi-
ty’s priority is to aid as many
qualified applicants as possible.
“Unfortunately, we can’t say that
the ability to attend is not based
on the ability to pay, as some Ivy
League schools can,”’ he said.

However, in an experiment last
year, Laszewski tried just that.
‘All those admitted that were
determined to be in need received
some form of aid. Laszewski em-
phasized fair treatment, where
two students in similar positions
could expect to receive similar
aid packages.

He said the office was suc-
cessful in meeting these needs,
but was 20 percent low in their
estimate of how many needed
aid. “Inflation and increased de-
mand has made it impossible to
continue the policy of aiding all
needy incoming freshmen,”
Laszewski said. ‘We'll have to
ask everyone for more self-help
aid, such as loans and employ-
ment,” he added.

In determining the amount of
aid available, Laszewski said he
must manage the flow of federal
funds to needy students, direct
scholarship assistance from the
University, and self help sources.

The total annual amount spent on
financial aid here approaches

Laszewski said he is worried

Laszewski’s changes in finan-
cial aid management in the in-
creasingly complex market have
apparently not offended a great
number of students, according to
Smith. His office has dealt with
ten cases this year, which Smith
said was ‘‘normal.””

“This doesn’t indicate that only
10 people are dissatisfied with the
changes in the financial aid struc-
ture,” Smith said. “It just in-

dicates how many have com-
plained about it.”

Smith said that Laszewski’s
changes are now in the review
stage, in order to maintain a con-
tinuity in aid philosophy. He said
that once federal policy changes
and an assessment of the com-
petition are completed, a
“philosophy of some type will be
formulated later in the
semester.”

Prison officials, NAACP
still at odds in dispute

By LYNNE RUTHERFORD

Lewisburg Prison Officials have apparently refused to reinstate
privileges to the prison’s chapter of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People.

On Sept. 8, Warden J. Petrovsky denied the inmate’s chapter of the
NAACP access to outside members for six months. Petrovsky con-
tended that the chapter, by permitting outside members to lead their
meetings, was violating prison regulations that required all inmate
groups to be self-governing. ;

The action prompted protests from Leroy Mobley, national director
of the NAACP prison program, founder of the Lewisburg chapter of
the NAACP, and also of the Lewisburg Prison Project, a local
volunteer organization dedicated to the safeguarding of prisoner’s
rights.

Clifford Kinney, executive assistant to the warden, said at the time
the case would be brought for review within a month. If the chapter
was found to be in compliance with prison regulations, their privileges
would be restored.

Mobley, who pledged to continue protesting the move until the
chapter’s rights were reinstated, has failed in his efforts to bring the
matter to the attention of the Bureau of Prisons in Washington. The
NAACP has also failed to contact the Lewisburg Prison Project for
further assistance on the matter.

Kinney said the action was taken because the NAACP was interfer-
ing with and setting goals for the chapter, and refusing to let the in-
mates ‘do their own thing.”’

Prison officials have refused to cite specific instances of NAACP in-
terference, however.

The Forum of the University

The panel discussion was led by
Phil Andrews ’81. The speakers
included Richard Brown, Alter-

State; Michael Barry, Country
Officer for El Salvador, U.S.

“Overview Latin America.”

The first spokesman, Richard
Brown, discussed U.S. policy
toward the region of Central
America which is in the midst of
a difficult transition. He said the
country is divided between the
old order and the new reac-
tionary and revolutionary forces.

Brown said the old order’s
power is diminishing because of
Cuban suppression and rising oil
prices, but that a new en-
compassing power has not
emerged. He said instead of the
U.S. imposing its own views in
Central America, they should opt
for a peaceful and democratic
change.

Central America is divided into
democratic, totalitarian, and
authoritarian regimes, according
to an interpretation by Enrique
Altomirano. He presented an
analysis of the U.S. presence in
Central America to be like ‘an
elephant in a boat, if it moves it’s
a bother and if it doesn’t move it’s
a bother.’ Altomirano said

change was not inevitable,
however, and that it was brought
about by external, and not inter-
nal, forces.

He said the Carter Administra-
tion was one that tried to change
traditional patterns and support
local reforms. He said he hopes
the Reagan Administration will
be more realistic and helpful to
Central America.

The final two speakers,
Michael Barry and James
Harney, held contradictory views
on U.S. policy in El Salvador.
Barry said the U.S. is trying to in-
volve more people in the El
Salvadorian government, and
support the revolutionaries in El
Salvador.

Harney, speaking loudly and
dramatically, said the United
States’ interference caused the
worst repression in El Salvador
since 1932. Harney said he is con-
vinced that the government is op-
posing the people and that human
rights are being violated.

commonplace soon

By ANN PAVUK

“Assassins,” a game in which students pretend to kill each other,
is being organized here by Sean Nataro ’84, Nataro said he hopes to
have more than 100 students playing the game by Monday, when
the game is scheduled to begin.

The game of ‘‘make believe” killing is one in which students can
“ive out their fantasies,”’ Nataro said. To win the game, one must
be the last person ‘“‘alive” among those competing.

A student can be ‘“‘killed”’ with a water pistol, “blown up” by an
alarm clock, or ‘‘poisoned”’ with a sticker placed on something out
of which the student eats or drinks.

Nataro said ‘‘there isn’t a whole hell of a lot to do to escape” from
the reality of the rigid academic life here, and that the game seeks
to fulfill what he sees as a need for ‘fantasy fulfillment.”

The game is also designed to raise money for the Trax Dorm
Council, he said. Participants must pay a $1 entry fee to play the
game. Nataro said he had raised $25 by Tuesday, and that an addi-
tional 25 students had expressed interest in participating.

Nataro said the idea to initiate “Assassins” here began after he
saw the game in progress at Columbia University. The game was
contrived by the Columbia Games Committee, and is also popular
at both Yale and Dartmouth Universities.

The rules of the game prohibit “killing” someone in the
bookstore, the library, or during classes. The cafeteria is also ‘‘off-
limits,” thus making “death by poisoning” more difficult.

Assassinations are not permitted between 18 a.m. Once an
assassin “‘kills” his victim, he is issued a death certificate and
assigned another victim. The game continues until only one person
is left “alive.”

Nataro said he hopes the game will add excitement to the “‘hum-
drum routine” here. He said 365 students played the game at Yale.

The winner of the game will “probably” get a cash prize of
“about $20” according to Nataro. The amount of the prize will be a

percentage of the total money raised through enrollments, Nataro

said.

BSC student assaulted

A 19-year-old
State College woman may have
been raped on the BS.C. cam-
pus Saturday night, but police
there are not sure.

Bloomsburg police said the
woman, whose identity is being
withheld, was “beaten on her
way home from a party” at the
College at 11:30 p.m. Saturday.
There have been no arrests, and
there are no suspects in the
case.

Police said the woman was
returning from a party and was
walking alone down a street
“which was more like an alley,”
when “a guy came up to her
and started talking to her.”

The woman told police the
man struck her and knocked her
to the ground. At this point the

When she regained conscious-

Bloomsburg patrolman Albert

later, at about 2:30 a.m. He
said a composite drawing of the
suspect has been made, and that

Wagner said the woman does
not know if she was raped.
Police have described the in-
cident as one of “indecent and
aggravated assault, with attempt
to commit rape.”

Wagner said there has been
only one other assault at the
college this year. He said the in-
cidents are usually “just grabs

of Sweden Olof Palme to work as
a mediator to resolve the conflict
and end the fighting between Iraq
and Iran.

The appointment was made
Tuesday by Secretary General
Kurt Waldheim.

United Nations officials con-
sider Palme’s mission to be an all
but impossible task, since Iraq
appears to be expanding its
goals, however.

Although most members of the
Security Council are unwilling to
quash the Iraqi offensive against
Iran, a small faction on the Coun-
cil, including the United States,
are seeking to establish peace.

Public schools may
have religious rites

Hymns, carols and plays with
religious themes may be used in
public school observances or
religious holidays under a lower

court ruling made final Monday
by the Supreme Court.

By refusing to review the rul-
ing, public schools will be allowed
to continue to make references to
Jesus Christ despite objections
that they violate the constitu-
tional principle of separation of
church and state.

Student directories
provide info to all

The University Directory is a
matter of public record, and as
such may be used by the Selec-
tive Service Agency and other
federal, state, local and private
organizations to locate students,
according to Registrar Bruce
Freed.

Freed added, however, that
any personally identifiable in-
formation not listed in the book
will not be released by his office
or any other University officials.
He said to his knowledge there
has been no recent government
inquisition as to the identity or
enrollment of any students here.

A report in the Yale Daily News
two weeks ago warned students
to remove their names from the
Yale directory before the Selec-
tive Service could obtain a copy.

THC distribution by

government to begin

The active ingredient in mari-
juana will be distributed free of
charge to cancer victims by the
federal government within the
next month.

The U.S. will undertake the
distribution of the pills contain-
ing delta -9 - tetrahydrocannabinol,
or THC, to thousands of pa-
tients in an effort to combat the
vomiting and nausea which ac-
company chemotherapy.

The drug distribution program
is being conducted by the
National Cancer Institute.
Although some cancer experts
have called the government’s ac-
tions an “act of mercy,” others
see it as a dangerous and
“premature surrender to political
pressure,” according to reports in
the Washington Post.

Student newspaper
features drug prices

The Drug Enforcement Ad-
ministration is “appalled” at the
University of Illinois-Chicago stu-
dent newspaper for publishing a
list of street prices for various
drugs.

An independent newspaper at
the University, published by
former students and distributed
on campus, published a “street
drug price index” Sept. 22,
quoting the price of marijuana,
cocaine, LSD and speed.

The paper recently ran the
feature again, with updated
prices. According to law enforce-
ment officials, the prices pub-
lished in the paper—the Chicago
Illini—ate “absolutely accurate.”

Conn governor

complete her term

Continued rumors that
Governor Ella Grasso of Con-
necticut is resigning from her
gubernatorial post have “irked”
her, according to reports in the
Hartford Courant.

Grasso said she has “no plans
to resign” before her second
term expires in 1982, and that
plans to seek a third term are
“alive and well.”

Rumors have persisted in Har-
tford that the governor will re-
sign as of December 15. Grasso
said she has no idea where the
rumors are coming from.

Grasso had cancer surgery
April 3 and since then has had
radiation therapy. Although the
governor has not resumed a full
schedule, she said she is “feeling
better all the time.” “I see no
need to resign,” she said.

Racial tensions at
Williams seen rising

About 1,400 Williams College

easing the rise of racial tension
on that campus.

The gathering at the college—
which has increased its black en-
rollment from 30 to 130. stu-
dents in the past decade—was
called after a series of racial
threats culminating in a cross-
burning Halloween weekend.

Some black students said the

All but about 500 of Wil-

ranged from complaints about

panies doing business in South

Lice infests students
at Lewisburg school

Classes in the Lewisburg
School District were cancelled
Monday because of an outbreak
of head lice, officials said.

The cancellation followed
reports of seven new cases of
lice in the South Ward Elemen-
tary School Friday, according to
School Superintendent Donald
Eichhorn. Sixteen cases—one a
teacher and the rest students—
were reported at the South
Fourth Street school Monday.

The school, which is across

gated that day, and students re-
turned Tuesday at staggered
times so they could be checked
for the presence of the blood-
sucking mite.

McGahan’s statements were frighteningly inaccurate

To the Editor:

Though I am genuinely pleased
that the Chapel Choir is ‘‘moving
in a positive direction,” I found
the implications of Professor
Christopher McGahan’s state-
ments in last week’s Chapel Choir
article on the choir’s “new tune”
frighteningly inaccurate.

I’ve been a member of the
Bucknell community, and a fre-
quent member of the chapel con-
gregation for over five years; I
was never a member of the
Chapel Choir. From this unbiased
perspective I find it necessary to
clarify a few facts.

Obviously, the ‘group in-
herited from” Dr. McRae was of
substantially more than “17
members,”’ I recall approx-
imately 40. While the chapel ser-
vice benefits from the choir’s
“provision of hymns on alter-
nating Sundays,” it was unfair to
neglect mention of Dr. McRae’s
provision of an anthem every
Sunday for 32 years.

Yes, a “transition period’ is
necessary, but the Chapel Choir
survived replacement of Dr.
McRae by Prof. Jackson Hill in

1976 and of Rev. James Gardner
by Rev. James Hammerlee in
1978 during sabbatical leaves.
There was no attrition, no
“schizophrenia,”’ and no percep-
tible deficit in the growth or
general direction of the choir pro-
gram during these transitions.

Unfortunately, in the past 18
months, dedicated members of
the choir found that they were
honestly unable to continue as
supportive contributing
members of the Chapel Choir.
Concerning the ‘many people
who were not satisfied with the
choir under McRae’s direction”
who “rejoined the group last
year,” the past and present
members of the choir who I
queried were able to generate
two names of disgruntled
members who rejoined the choir
last year as seniors.

Yes, there has been a
“tremendous turnover of choir
members...under the new direc-
tor,” yet Bucknell University’s
Chapel Choir had always been
self-regenerating. I witnessed
choir members successfully
recruiting new enrollment
through their enthusiasm and
musical ‘“‘incentives” several

Former chapel choir
undeservedly tainted

To the Editor:

I was honestly appalled while reading last week’s article about

years ago. These choir members
were not coercing new sailors for
an otherwise floundering ship.

Obviously, there has always
been that ‘‘sense of community
that is at the heart of musical ex-
perience” in the choir. In 1978,
over 200 alumni returned to
Bucknell for a weekend for the
sole purpose of singing in a com-
memorative concert and service
marking the 30th anniversary of
William McRae’s Chapel Choir.

This month I witnessed a
former member of the choir
begin to sing a piece from the an-
nual choir tour of 1977 or 1978.
Two other members joined in,
forming a spontaneously perfect

which none of them had seen for
at least two years.

Clearly, this is not the work of a
“schizophrenic group that didn’t
know where it was going.’”’ They
had certainly arrived.

Most disturbing was the im-
plication that the essential sense
of ensemble is being created in
the chapel this year. The Chapel
Choir who first ministered to me
four years ago had a ‘‘sense of
striving,” an overwhelming
espirit de corps, and love. I’ve
been involved in the performing
arts for 19 years, yet I can honest-
ly say that I had never seen a
more unified, purposeful, yet
non-exclusionary group.

its parts, pumped much of the
lifeblood of the worship at-
mosphere through the Chapel
community for many years.

Finally, the Chapel Choir
shown in the photograph was not
performing “‘last year.” The
choir, which was only partially
visible, was shown singing
Celebrate Life (Red & Courtney)
under the direction of Dr,
William McRae in the spring of
1979.

McGahan was quoted, ‘‘we
haven’t died.” If there ever was a
question of terminal illness, it
was not during McRae’s tenure
behind the organ in Rooke
Chapel.

The mode of direction was unclear

To the Editor:

I would like to note a number of corrections that
should be made in the article in last week’s
Bucknellian about the Chapel Choir.

The Chapel Choir numbered upwards of 35 people
when Visiting Assistant Professor of Music,
Christopher McGahan inherited it from Professor of
Music, William McRae, not its later lowpoint of 17
members. At that time, it was a well-formed,
closely-knit group. During the “transition period,”
most members did give Mr. McGahan a chance to
adjust to Bucknell before they decided to drop out.

If the choir was a “‘schizophrenic group that didn’t
know where it was going,” it was because Mr.
McGahan’s mode of direction was unclear. We were
unsure whether we were to be singing a per-
formance for each Sunday’s service or to provide

the service with music, whether we were singing
secular music or sacred music or a combination of
both, and whether we should dress in formal gowns
and tuxes or the traditional choir robes for per-
formances. The message was inconsistent.

Some people, not satisfied with the choir under
McRae’s direction, may have rejoined the group,
put a much larger contingent of people not satisfied
swith Mr. McGahan’s direction have left the choir.

I come to the conclusion that Mr. McGahan has
matured and changed many of his attitudes since
the choir enrollment is beginning to regain its
previous numbers.

the Chapel Choir in the Bucknellian. After returning to Bucknell
after a year’s absence, my only memories of the choir are under
Dr. McRae’s direction. I have no recollection of us being a

“schizophrenic group that didn’t know where it was going,” as

Christopher McGahan, Visiting Assistant Professor of Music, said.
The united agreement amongst its members and its director was to
fulfill spiritual needs—our own and the Bucknell community’s—by

providing music to the campus.

Granted, we never sounded like the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.
Granted, our annual fall tours were not showings of perfection.
Granted, on an occasional Sunday, our anthems were lacking. But,
I never saw the Christian spirit, which_ prevailed under Dr.

McRae’s direction, ever diminish.

I realize that criticism which comes from uninformed mouths
should not matter to those who know the truth, but I feel that both
the former chapel choir, and especially the former director, have

been undeservedly tainted.

Dianne L. Bouvier ’81

To the Editor:

I am writing in response to
Kenneth Gaul’s letter to the
editor in which he asserted that
granting academic credit to the
ABS president could lead to a
“Pandora’s Box of problems,
demands and potential abuses”
since it would set a precedent
which would enable other student
activity leaders to demand credit
for their extracurricular ac-
tivities.

According to Gaul, ‘‘any think-
ing person should be able to
visualize’ the dangers of such a

Chem engineers’ T-shirts criticized

To the Editor:

Suspended from the ceiling of the chemical
engineering lab in Dana is a T-shirt bearing the
slogan ‘God Created Engineers-Arts Majors
Evolved From Apes.”

If you are a liberal arts major you probably have
not had the pleasure of viewing this hot item.
However, the creators of the T-shirt have been kind
enough to give the entire student body an opportuni-
ty to purchase their product.

Last week a flyer advertising these “all-purpose”
shirts was sent to every Bucknell student by a group
of engineering students. The obvious criticism of
their action is the blanket distribution of these
flyers; many arts majors and indeed some science
majors found the slogan and the unrequested
solicitation both unnecessary and offensive.

It is striking that those who sent these forms did
not sense that their words might be insulting to a
large part of the student body. The T-shirt’s con-
descending phrase is no more amusing than a
“good-natured” ethnic slur.

Both have the effect of pitting one group against
another at the expense of mutual growth and

understanding. It is just this ‘expense’ which
Bucknell must pay from such thoughtless words and
action.

Instead of urging us to respect individualism and
to learn from our differences, these condescending
attitudes and phrases make our variant course
selections appear negative. The bout for the most
taxing (or most technical or most scholarly...) ma-
jor could increase in severity until our academic
differences are irreconcilable.

It is this criticism of the shirt’s creators which,
while less obvious, is much more serious than a
criticism of their impetuosity.

Bucknell is not merely a college of engineering,
but also one of the arts and other sciences. AS such,
our community gives each student the chance to in-
teract with the principles and practices of many,
many disciplines.

If we ignore this opportunity by clouding our
minds with elitest thoughts we run the risk of snob-
bery and a subsequent intolerance of those different
from ourselves.

precedent. However, it is my opi-
nion, the perceived danger isa
result of Ken’s and others’ confu-
sion about the proposal rather
than from implications of it. 1am
grateful to Ken for raising this
question so that I could clarify
the issue.

Although my efforts may have
been described as attempting to
give credit for student activities
per se, this is not correct. Instead
it is my intention to raise con-
sciousness about the op-
portunities currently available
through non-traditional study
curriculum which has been in ex-
istence for seven years at
Bucknell University in hopes that
student activity leaders would
take advantage of this program.

It was never assumed that ex-
tracurricular activities would
serve as the sole criteria for
awarding academic credit. Any
non-traditional study must be in-
dividually proposed and nego-
tiated with the appropriate
academic department and facul-
ty member. Also, the course must
meet as rigorous academic stan-
dards as other courses or the pro-
posal will not be honored.

Currently, this is done for the
editor of the Bucknellian and
L’Agenda with no guarantees
that their successors will receive
credit. Each semester the
responsibility resides with stu-
dent leaders to work out an ar-
rangement with the sponsoring
department.

If a number of students can
demonstrate why a proposed

Dzurinko clarifies the credit issue

course which includes extracur-
ricular activities be granted
course credit, then the traditional
definition of curriculum gives
way to a novel curricular ap-
proach. This is in the spirit of
non-traditional study, and in my
opinion should be encouraged as
creative response to a new educa-
tional environment.

Although Gaul feels there is not
a shortage of talented, motivated
students at Bucknell as proven by
the numerous student-directed
organizations, the ability to
assure continuity within groups
has been a real problem, and in
many cases filling positions,
especially in the ABS, has been
difficult.

I would argue that when crises
exist in society accompanied by a
shrinking job market, many
students become more career
conscious and unwilling to spend
free time on extracurricular ac-
tivities.

Student activities make up an
indispensable part of college
education. As ABS president, it is
my responsibility to help assure
that student activities flourish.

By raising the topic of non-
traditional study in relation to ex-
tracurricular activities, I want to
encourage student leaders to take
advantage of this opportunity. It
is my hope that it will enrich stu-
dent activities to the benefit of
the entire Bucknell community.

The 1 percent solution

The tentative and optimistic announcement that the University is
planning the largest capital campaign in Bucknell history for the
mid 1980s reminds us with regret that there is still one capital cam-
paign from the early 1970s that has never been completed.

Fortunately, the ABS Congress has been thinking about the same
unfinished plans in the same unfinished building, and their call this
week for completion of the University Center’s third floor in an af-

The University’s experimental policy on financial aid — in essence
a policy of giving less financial aid per capita to twice as many peo-
ple — is an admirable one that should be advanced at all possible
chances.

Of course, cutting the pie into smaller pieces is not the only way to
increase the amount of aid available. The work-study program, if
utilized properly, could add considerably to the University’s ability
to help needy students meet their monetary obligations.

It’s killing us

Thanksgiving is once again taking its sweet time to gobble its way
toward us. It’s getting cold, and it gets darker earlier now, and
things aren’t orange and red and yellow any more (they’re just
grey), and you sit at your desk, and you tap your pencil, and you sigh
and take another sip of Pepsi but you just can’t write-that paper.

The work is really piling up and you need a study break. Now there
is something at Bucknell to ease the crashing academic burdens.

“‘Assassins’” — an interesting diversion designed to lighten the
leadlike load of libraryites — has been introduced here by an im-
aginative freshman who observed it being played at Columbia. If
Yalies can push around a giant “bladderball,”’ Bucknellians can
dart between the bushes and peer around corners pretending to be
killers stalking their hapless and unknowing victims.

Morbid, yes; but as long as water pistols and alarm clocks
substitute for Colt 45s and timebombs, Bucknell is bestowed with an
entertaining new pastime fad.

Perhaps even the professors who won’t give Bucknellian editors
extensions on their papers would like to play

Disrespect is manifest in

By TODD G. BUCHHOLZ

“Everyone thinks himself well-
bred,” said Lord Shaftesbury
long ago.

Bucknellians surely think of
themselves as well-mannered
and polite. But according to in-
formants, this is untrue. Several
crack investigators have reveal-
ed disturbing incidents of im-
propriety.

For instance, classes in the
Vaughan Literature Auditorium
end with a bang. Students begin
slamming down their desk tops in
cut time (ten minutes before the
hour). It sounds like part of a
Sousa march. Professors like to
get into the act too. They enjoy
raising their voices and scream-
ing in time with the slamming.

The acoustics of the
Auditorium add to the effect. The

(SETH GOTME A DATE WITH

slamming, banging, and scream-
ing reverberate like the
Lewisburg High School band at 8
a.m. practices.

{n the University Center, the
Forum brings out the best in eti-
quette. No matter how in-
teresting the lecturer, some
students must leave early to at-
tend another function or do
schoolwork. Fine. But must they
stroll out the doors walking in
front of the lecturer?

Here’s a well-kept secret: the
Forum has doors in the back for
those who want to sneak out ear-
ly. Surprise! Professors are not
exempt from these criticisms
either.

The disrespect we show by
walking out on lectures or by
slamming desk tops down is
manifest in our words also. The

way we address someone in con-
versation indicates our respect
for them.

The popular and vulgar “pissed
off” is a good example. I cringe
as I write the phrase. Even pro-
fessors use it. No one uses the ex-
pression while speaking to those
we revere or honor, such as
clergymen. Yet we freely tell
each other how ‘‘pissed off we
feel.”

Surely a synonym like irate,
disgusted, or indignant would
serve the purpose of communica-
tion and connote a mutual respect
between speaker and listener.

I believe there is a correlation
between how we think about peo-
ple, how we act toward people
and how we talk to them. Some of
the cliched and vacuous idioms
heard around campus seem to

our words as well as actions

demonstrate an absence of
thought.

“For sure,” “key,” “go for it,”
and ‘rude’? are senselessly
sprinkled through conversation
like natural dirt on veg meals. In-
stead of choosing our words
carefully, we reach for the
nearest cliche. It’s much easier,
but it dulls our ability to com-
municate creatively, intensely
and effectively.

Nobody expects Bucknellians
to bow like princes or speak in
Shakespearean sonnets. But
slamming desks and being ‘‘bum-
med out”’ is inexcusable and can
easily get people ‘pissed off.”

American metamorphosis [“ harrisburg reproductive

By ORLANDO B. HANSELMAN

“we must realize that the democratic form of government is bound
to penetrate our industrial life as well. It cannot be confined merely to
our political institutions,” pontificated Sidney Hillman, former Presi-
dent of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers Union, in 1924.

This democratic penetration into the economic sphere has yet to be
realized. It could be different.
could be difficult.

The incoming Reagan administration could transform every
American into a worker, a citizen, and a capitalist. The tools for this
metamorphosis are currently available. First, according to the Joint
Economic Committee, pension funds now hold approximately 20 per-
cent of the market value of all outstanding stock.

Furthermore, the committee predicts that by 1985 this figure will
have increased to 50 percent. These investments, held for the workers
as earned future compensation, are being managed and voted in bloc
by Wall Street bankers.

By turning over the voting rights to the workers themselves as they
accrue pension rights, stock control of American corporations could
be altered significantly.

And secondly, through Employee Stock Ownership Plans, which
give corporations major tax benefits for transferring shares of stock
to the employees, the government has designed a tool that could
facilitate this shift to economic democracy. In addition, the ESOPs
provide the corporation with an easy, tax free method to finance
future growth and productivity increases.

If the White House would issue a policy statement actively en-
couraging the use of ESOP legislation that already exists, another
viable means for making every Americana capitalist would flourish.

The Homestead Act, implemented in the mid-nineteenth century,
made millions of Americans land owners for the first time. Today, the
means exist to make every American a substantial stockholder in U.S.
corporations.

By giving every citizen votes in the economic sector through stock
ownership, the Reagan administration could introduce democracy to
industrial life as well as to political life. The gauntlet remains to be
taken up.

BUCKNELL

The streets leading to the Uni-
versity are lined with stately
nineteenth century homes. In
the dusk of a fall evening, walk-
ing the streets of Lewisburg with
their elegant street lights is a
walk into an earlier America.

Virtually every organization, group or club of
the University advertises itself in the form of
pamphlets distributed by the Public Relations
Office. These publications are written by the
organization or department sometimes by the
students themselves, cleared by the office and
receive the University’s sanction when they are
sent to the printers and dispensed to students.
They are also prominently displayed in the Of-
fice of Admissions reception area.

In the interests of attracting prospective
freshmen, and enhancing its prestige, does the
University create an overly positive view of
itself in this literature?

“I can’t believe they’d print that,”’ Anne Mcin-
tyre ’82, said of the above quote from the
“Bucknell: an Introduction” pamphlet. “‘It’s not
totally true.’’

BUCKNELL

Each semester we attempt to bring a well-known
Jewish personality to campus as a guest lecturer. All
Jewish students at Bucknell are automatically mem-
bers of Hillel, and a varied Jewish life is offered to
all who choose to partake. A semester calendar and

Hoan of coming events are distributed to all mem-
rs.

More specific literature elicited a variety of responses from students, both
positive and negative.

“Hillel hasn’t forced me to do anything, but they’ve gotten my attention all the
time,” Jeffrey Dener ’83, a student who has never participated in the organization
but is still on their mailing list, said.

Lack of time and heavy class schedules have prevented Dener, and many
students like him, from participating more fully in Hillel. Other activities also eat
away at Jewish student’s time.

“They really are active and offer a lot of things,” agreed Eric Smith ’83. Such ac-
tivities include wine and cheese parties, roller skating trips, and study breaks in
addition to the regular religious services.

More active members of Hillel also support the pamphlet’s claim.

“The activities we hold openly encourage new people to come. The establish-
ment of Martin House (Hillel’s special interest residence) was important. It’s a
good meeting place,”’ said Gail Cooper ’81.

Martin House was founded in 1979 and has been at the center of Hillel activities
ever since. Faculty members deliver lectures at the house, and Rabbi David L.
Silverman, their faculty advisor, speaks there often. The Religion Department is
also offering a course for credit in modern Hebrew.

An important function of the Public Relations Office is

From features on current students to class notes from
graduates of 1912, the publication does just that.

Besides articles on students, Bucknell World does

The Black Student

Like other black students on predomi-
Many young women still choose nantly white campuses, we are ina
unique situation. We are learning to deal
with this environment, and we remain
very special individuals and gain strength
from our collective efforts.

The Black Student Alliance is another student organiza-
tion that writes its own pamphlet. As blacks on a predominant-
ly white campus, these students have found the need to
establish their own organization as a forum for black needs
and ideas. Although most members of the organization sup-
ported its pamphlet’s contents, several expressed disappoint-
ment that the BSA is not as strong as it should be.

“J disagree with the quote. We’re not totally a collective
group. Too many people aren’t active and don’t come to our
meetings,” said Vergel Blake ’82.

‘As with Hillel, some black students have found that other
time commitments preclude their participation in BSA.

In general, however, the University’s pamphlets appear to
be a reasonably accurate representation of what the campus
can offer. Many other pamphlets, not mentioned here, exist to
give important information on various departments. They
don’t entirely shift focus away from weak spots; they just
soften the lenses a little.

Meredith, who worked in conjunction with Roland King,
director of public relations and publications, during the
summer to produce the most recent issue.

Although the publication is not specifically designed to
inspire contributions or advertise fundraisers, it serves a
similar purpose simply by keeping parents and alumni in-
formed.

“When people read about specific programs, they may
become interested and choose to give money to them,”
said Meredith.

“Jt is an informed alumni that will donate. Bucknell
World is part of the overall development program,”
agreed Ray Painter, assistant director of alumni rela-
tions.

The class notes section of the magazine provides data on

alumni from the class of 1910 to last year’s graduating
seniors. It is compiled from letters sent by alumni either
to the class secretary or directly to the Alumni Relations
Office.

“The publication represents the whole concept of public
relations. Everything that leaves Bucknell has an image,
and we work for months on each issue and hire a profes-
sional to do our layout. Our goal is to make it as classy as
we can,” said Meredith.

Apart from Bucknell World, the distribution of press
releases to the rest of campus is a time consuming part of
the Public Relation Office’s activities. The office present-
ly employs three students for typing, filing and general of-
fice work to help with this duty.

Student tour guides give
positive view of campus

By LYNNE RUTHERFORD

As the deadline for freshman applications draws near, more and more students
can be seen leading prospective applicants around campus, investigating the
various buildings as well as explaining some of the complexities of life at Bucknell.
What sort of a picture do these student guides paint of the University?

“We don’t tell our guides what to say. Obviously, they are not in the business of
giving a negative view of the campus, but on the other hand, a big sales job isn’t call-
ed for either. A person who turns cartwheels and says they love every day they
spend there would do more harm than good,”’ said Richard Skelton, director of ad-
missions.

“They ask tour guides to be honest. Sometimes I have been asked questions that
put me in a precarious position, but being honest is better than presenting a rosy pic-
ture that’s too good to be true,’’ said guide Shelli Wallis ’82.

Skelton said the guides selected by the admissions office are students it has found
to be responsible, dependable, articulate and — most importantly — well informed.

“Someone who has a good general knowledge of the University and studies our
fact sheet will definitely make the best tour guide,” Skelton said.

The tours, which run five times a day during the week and twice a day on
weekends, include Coleman Hall, the Ellen Bertrand Library, the Olin Science and
Dana Engineering Buildings, the University Center and some of the neater
freshman dormitory rooms.

“] think parents who are spending eight or nine thousand dollars a year want to
look at the academic, sleeping and dining facilities on campus,” said Skelton.

Eligibility requirements for guiding tours are simple. The admissions office keeps
a list of all those interested in the job, and as senior guides graduate or give up the
job, sophomores are inserted. The new guides then attend two tour guide meetings
and are required to read both the ‘Bucknell in Brief’ pamphlet and the various fact
sheets published by the office. They are then sent to accompany a more experienced
guide during his tour before undertaking the responsibility themselves.

The fact sheet includes information about the University’s class sizes, stu-
dent/faculty ratio, financial aid practices and history. A special fact sheet on the
library is also required reading.

As to the banter between prospective freshmen,
depends on the individual guide.

“When students ask about the social life here, I usually tell them it’s what you
make it. Fraternity parties are one way to meet people, but there are many other
things to do,” said Wallis.

“There are lots of different things to do. Fraternity parties, coffeehouses,
movies—it’s up to them,” said guide Laurie Kochanek ’82.

If several guides are available at the same time, they usually try to match
themselves up with applicants according to the visitor’s prospective major. If that’s
not possible, guides rarely venture a guess on departments they’re not familiar
with.

“When someone asks me a question about a department I don’t know much about,
I suggest that they go talk with a person involved in it, like the head of the depart-
ment or a professor,” is the way Lisa Tilton ’82 said she handles the situation.

Perhaps the most often-asked question is the familiar refrain, “Is this school very
hard?”

“Again, I’m honest with them. Not only is it hard to get into Bucknell, it’s hard to
stay in,” said Wallis.

All-night DJs serenade sleepy students

WVBU’s program of 24-hour music b

By DEBBIE SAUERLAND

WVBU-FM has once again extended its
late-night hours, serenading yawning
Bucknellians through the wee hours of the
morning three nights a week. -

According to Jay Cresswell ’81, the FM
program director, the idea of expanding
the station’s air time began shortly after
Spring Break last semester as a means of
enhancing WVBU’s image.

The object, Cresswell stated, was to
make the listening community — local af-
ficionados as well as Bucknell students —
more aware.

One of the best things about such pro-
gramming according to disc jockey Scott
McCleary ’82, is “‘it’s so free-form. You
can play just about anything you want.”
Cresswell added, ‘It makes it great for re-

quests.’ The two said requests have been
pouring in. McCleary said, “I was surpris-
ed I got any requests at all, but people are
very talkative at that hour.”

Cresswell agreed. ‘‘Once last year,’’ he
said, ‘“‘we had a record of 39 phone calls
between the hours of 2:30 and 7 a.m., and
just last week the phone was ringing off the
hook.”

Both Cresswell and McCleary said they
would like to see the station increase its
all-night programming to five evenings
per week. ‘‘Continuation next semester is
almost given,”’ Cresswell said. ‘“‘We have
a disc jockeys who really love to do

aS)”

McCleary said that while the number of
late-night listeners decreases as daylight
approaches, the devotion of the audience is
augmented. “The people listening like the

fact that we play their requests right
away. On most other stations you have a
half hour to an hour,” he said.

According to Cresswell, some of the
dedicated listeners aren’t to be found in
the Freshman Quad, in Old Swartz, or
even Bucknell West, but across the river,
working the night shift in the factories of
Milton.

“We even had the night stockboys at
Acme in Lewisburg calling up, asking to
hear “Rated X” by Pat Benatar,” said
Cresswell. And McCleary relates the story
of the Milton man who was constantly on
the phone between 3 and 7 a.m. making re-
quests because ‘‘he was so amazed they
were played so quickly.”

And what of the disc jockey turned night
owl? How does it feel to be cooped up in the

basement of Carnegie staring at equip-
ment while the rest of the campus softly
snores?

“You can’t think of it that way,’’ Mc-
Cleary said. ‘You have to imagine there’s
an audience of 750,000 out there.” He said,
however, it is ‘‘strange to come out of a
night’s work and see the sun rising over
Phi Psi.”

Although Cresswell said no DJ has ever
fallen asleep at the microphone, McCleary
recalls running a show and “thinking I was
in my room with the stereo on. It wasn’t
until I’d let the third song play that I really
thought about the fact that I was at the sta-
tion,” he said.

McCleary has a simple theory that
might explain the motivation of a disc
jockey late at night — ‘‘You feel good that
you’re being listened to,’’ he concluded.

Neil Young celebrates America
with ‘Hawks and Doves’ album

By ALWEAVER

A quick glance at the cover gives one a
good idea as to the theme of this album.
The bold white star in a blue field on the
front, and the red and white stripes on the
back of the cover blatantly hint at the con-
stant references to America occuring
throughout the disc.

In his fifteenth solo album, Hawks and
Doves, veteran singer/songwriter Neil
Young deals with the good and bad points
of life in the U.S.A. And he does so in his
usual erratic fashion — often brilliant,
sometimes downright awful.

Hawks and Doves is arranged in the
same mold as Young’s last studio album,
Rust Never Sleeps. Side one consists of
acoustic material which is uncharac-
teristically ineffectual, while side two re- !
bounds with some strong electric music.
However, the electric music on side two is

The play is directed by sophomore

in no way similar to that of Rust Never
Sleeps. Instead of rocking like the songs
“Powderfinger’”’ and “Hey Hey My My,”
side two of Hawks and Doves swings witha
genuine country music sound.

Gone from Rust Never Sleeps is its crisp,
clear production. Instead, Hawks and
Doves is rather poorly produced. The
acoustic guitars on side one sound terrible,
while side two sounds crudely produced—
perhaps to accentuate the country feel
Young wants to bring forth. Excellent
evidence of this are the ragged
background vocals of Ann Hillary O’Brien
and Ben Keith.

The first side kicks off rather in-
conspicuously with “Little Wing,” fol-
lowed by a seven and one-half minute saga
entitled ‘‘The Old Homestead.” Recorded
originally in 1974, the song presents some
interesting lyrics in spite of its banal,
rambling melody.

The third track, “Lost in Space,” does
absolutely nothing to enhance the acoustic
set. The best effort on the acoustic side is
the final selection, ‘‘Captain Kennedy.” In
this ballad, Young recounts the horrors of
war when he sings:

“There's water on the wood and the sails
feel good.And when I get to the shore I hope
that I can kill good.”

Hawks and Doves, was released
this week.

Side two redeems the album to some ex-
tent. ‘Staying Power” is a gentle country
song which quickly reminds a young fan of
his popular Harvest LP. “Coastline,’”’ the
following number, continues in this vein.
The final three songs of this side save the
album from its otherwise bland sound.

The first, “Union Man,” is a splendid
parody of organized labor, with some good
guitar picking and smooth fiddle playing,
courtesy of Rufus Thibodeaux. “Comin’
Apart at Every Nail,” with its haunting
background vocals, deals with the mount-
ing problems of America.

The final song, title cut of the album,
gives Young’s final verdict on America:

“Ready to go, willing to stay and pay

U.S.A., U.S.A.

So my sweet love can dance another free
day
U.S.A., USA.”

Done in the classic Young style, this
song ties up the album’s theme and also
redeems it musically to some extent. But
until Young puts his sizzling electric guitar
back into his music any effort of his,
regardless of its lyrics, will only make the
listener anxiously await his next album.

‘West Branch’ offers a
wide variety of lively,
unusual verse to many

By LYNNE RUTHERFORD

The seventh edition of West Branch, the twice
yearly magazine of poetry and fiction edited by
‘Associate Professors of English Karl Patten and
Robert Taylor, began distribution last week.

Works are submitted by authors throughout the
country, ‘‘but our acceptance rate runs about 3 per-
cent. When we attend publishers’ conferences,
though, we find this rate to be the norm,” Patten
said.

The editors’ selectivity shows in West Branch 7.
The magazine, offering a variety of lively and
unusual poetry, maintains the delicate balance be-
tween light and heavy verse with skill. Many of the
poems deal with man’s interaction with nature, and
exude a fresh, organic quality.

Of special note are the poems of Stephanie
Strickland, a women’s studies librarian at Sarah
Lawrence College. Strickland writes of sexual rela-
tionships with an exceptional blend of tenderness
and strength, evoking a potent and immediate
response from the reader.

On the prose side of the publication, Layle
Silbert’s ‘‘Hard:Times,” a short story told through
the eyes of a young girl who loves to read, is an ex-
cellent rendition of both rural life and the special
perceptions of children.

Particularly innovative are the works of
Charlotte Mandel, a widely published New Jersey
poet. Mandel combines mediums to form a unique

WEST BRANCH 7

The cover of West Branch 7, the literary
magazine that went on sale last week. Its
publication was celebrated, as usual, with a
poetry festival here.

The editors promote the magazine by conducting
a poetry festival after each edition of the publica-
tion comes out. By bringing poets represented in
West Branch 7 to campus to read from their works
last week, they offered students the opportunity to
gain further insight into printed literature. Their
practice is a unique one and should be lauded.

The literature of West Branch 7 is not always easy
to read or readily accessible; however, good poetry
and fiction often are not. As Patten states in his
afterword to magazine, ‘‘We are all living history,
and our works of the imagination are expressions,
as real as we can make them, of that fact.”

We Think You Should, Too! That's

why on November

served up at

By AMY FORTGANG

For some, eating out means
getting dressed up and going toa
fine candlelit restaurant, which
may be fine for people who can
afford it. For the poor college stu-
dent who simply wants a change
of pace from institutional food
there often seems to be no
recourse but to dine at a cheap
fast-food or pizza establishment.

Now there is another choice.
The Scarlet D, in Mifflinburg, lies
somewhere between the elegant
but expensive meal and the af-
fordable alternative. For the stu-
dent with transportation the

Scarlet D is a short 20 minute
drive west on Route 45.

Situated in a 19th-century hotel,
the restaurant takes its name
from the era of its building.

“In those days,’ owner Bill
Heim explained, ‘there used to
be an officer who would go
around checking the local bars.
He’d keep tabs on the drinking
habits of the locals.”

If you were caught drunk too
many times you were branded —
in the tradition of Hester Prynne
— with a scarlet ‘D’ and declared
a drunkard.

The small-town friendliness of
those earlier days is still present
at this tavern/restaurant. The
waitress was unhurried and will-
ing to spend some time talking
with a customer and explaining
the menu items. Even the owner
had a chance to sit and chat.

The food is both affordable and

the ‘D’
plentiful. Prices range from $3.25
for the daily special to $5 for a full
dinner. Wednesday’s special is
lasagna and the dish is served in
the Italian tradition of hearty
eating. A heaping portion of the
meaty casserole is accompanied
by two generous, flavorful slices
of garlic bread and a salad that is
fresher than the caf’s, albeit just
as unimaginative. Parmesan
cheese will be furnished upon re-
quest and liberal sprinklings of it
add to the mild lasagna.

Crab Cakes, a Central Penn-
sylvania staple that is too often
dry and overcoated, were made
of thin bread coatings around a
sweet, tender crabmeat filling.
They were served with fried
potato skins, a specialty of the
“Dp” that is part crunchy potato
chip and part french fry. A bowl
of the restaurant’s locally famous
chili (.75) served to make the
meal a filling one.

Two pieces of homemade pie
(.80 each) put an excellent end to
the dinner. The shoofly pie,
although a little on the dry side,
had the wet molasses bottom
that makes the crumbly quality
of the dish easy to take. The
blueberry pie was sweet without
being cloying, and had a light
flavor to it that went well with the
flaky crust containing it.

The tab for a dinner for two —
plus two drinks — came to a total
of $13.44. An enjoyable meal far
surpassing that available at Mac-
Donald’s and much less expen-
sive than the Lewisburg Inn.

McQueen, 50, dies
in Mexican hospital

Steve McQueen, actor in more
than 24 films, died of a heart at-
tack Friday in a Juarez, Mexico
hospital 15 hours after under-
going surgery for removal of a
malignant tumor.

McQueen, 50, whose condition
had been declared hopeless by
doctors, attracted attention this
fall by entering an unconven-
tional clinic in Baja, California in
an attempt to overcome the
cancer in his lungs, chest and ab-
dominal cavity. His controversial
regimen involved receiving nutri-
tional supplements and animal
cell injections, following special
diets and going through con-
sciousness training.

McQueen ended his formal
education after ninth grade,
which he spent in reform school,
and held several jobs—including
that of deckhand on a Greek oil
tanker, lumberjack in California,
oil rigger in Texas and barker for
a traveling circus.

He finally settled in Greenwich
Village in New York City, where
it was suggested by a friend that
he give acting a try.

McQueen came a long way
from his one line debut in a Yid-
dish language play in 1952 to be-
ing one of the highest paid film
stars of the 1960s and 70s. What
Director Robert Wise called a
“Jean and hungry look which men
identify with and which arouses
in women their desire to love”
brought him fame during his 22-
year movie career.

Yale museum given
$4. million artwork

The Yale University Art
Gallery has received a gift of $4
million worth of modern art and
$2 million for maintenance, hous-
ing and collection additions from
the estate of Katharine Ordway
of Weston, Conn.

The gift, announced Saturday
by museum officials, came in the
form of a bequest from Ordway,
who died last year at the age of
80. Although the donation was
received last spring, announce-
ment was delayed until a suitable
gallery could be constructed for
display of the works.

The new Katharine Ordway
Gallery cost Yale $300,000 to
remodel and will open Dec. 5 with
Picasso, Brancusi, Calder,
Pollack, Rothko, Gorky,
Rousseau, Renoir and de Kooning
works among those exhibited
from the new collection.

The Yale gallery, the oldest
university art museum in the
hemisphere, according the New
York Times, was given instruc-

tions with the gift that $1 million
was to be spent on maintenance
of the collection and another $1
million was to go toward the ac-
quiring of contemporary
American art.

Duckworth and Hill
receive fifth awards

For the fifth consecutive
year, Assistant Professor of
Music William Duckworth, and
Acting Head and Associate
Professor of Music Jackson Hill
have received the 1980-81 Amer-
ican Society of Composers,
Authors and Publishers (ASCAP)
awards.

ASCAP presents the awards
annually to assist and encourage
composers of serious music. An
independent panel selects the
recipients on the basis of their
contributions as writers of music,
and also based on public per-
formances of their compositions.

Both Duckworth and Hill
have also received the Lindback
Award for Distinguished Teach-

SPORTS PROFILE
PECOnESCHar halfback Ken Jenkins: ‘the franchise’

Ken Jenkins ‘82 breaks upfield in the fourth quarter Saturday. Jenkins rushed
21 times for 84 yards to break the University single season rushing record with

1,079 yards.
BY ERIC HOERNER

“He’s the franchise,” is what Head
Coach Bob Curtis says about junior half-
back Ken Jenkins’ contribution to the
football team.

Curtis claims, “Among the division I-
AA teams we play and the Ivy League
teams, I don’t see any better back,” ad-
ding, “He’s a leader for the offense both
on and off the field.”

Against Colgate Saturday, Jenkins set
the school record for yards gained in one
season with 1,079 yards, and tied the
record for touchdowns scored in a season
with 14. He currently leads Division I-
AA with an average of 185.4 all-purpose
yards per game.

Jenkins, however, prefers to give credit
to other team members, stating, “Break-
ing the records means a lot because this
is the first time I’ve done it, but I don’t
take it out of context. I know the offen-
sive line is the only reason I’ve had such
a good year. I don’t have raw talent.”

Although the Bisons are 5-4,
kins’ opinion,

in Jen-
they are a very talented
team. “Other teams have had a lot of
heart, but this is the best team I’ve
played on,” he said.

Jenkins cites several reasons for the
improvement over last year’s 4-4-2 squad.

First, Jenkins mentioned a lack of
serious injuries to the offensive line.
“We’ve been able to work as a unit all
season long. Like I said after the Cornell
game, we're like a fine tuned machine.”

A consistent backfield is a second fac-
tor, noted Jenkins. “Marshall Hall, Geoff
Gallo and the two quarterbacks, Al
Locey and Ed Hughes, are all effective

BH Oct. 25.

offensive backs which means that the op-
position can’t stop us by concentrating on
me.”

Finally, he said, “I personally know the
offense better this year. The Wing-T is
difficult to learn, but now I feel com-
fortable with it.”

Looking at the season so far, Jenkins
said the Brown game was the team’s
most important. The Bisons upset the
Bruins 28-20 in the third game of the
season.

“Colgate was a super game, but it was
* depressing to lose. It would have been
our biggest win,” he added.

As for the low point of the season,
Jenkins said, “Personally, the Lehigh
game was the hardest to come back from.
I’ve been the big play man all season,
but in that game I didn’t do the job.”
Jenkins fumbled four times and was
limited to 55 yards rushing in the 13-0
loss to Lehigh on the rainy Saturday,

Jenkins, a graduate of The Landon
School, in Bethesda, Maryland wasn’t
heavily recruited by colleges

“Lehigh said I was too small. I visited
Lafavette and Buckiicli and decided to
come here. I was impressed with Buck-
nell’s schedule—we play good teams week
in and week out,” he said.

“The main reason I came here was to
get an education. I planned to play foot-
ball because I like the game, but I wasn’t
even sure if I could play on the college
level, much less this well,” Jenkins con-
tinued.

A management major, Jenkins said he
is “satisfied with his education so far.”
He added, “I’m not the greatest student,
but I fare well.”

Jenkins attributes much of his success
to his close work with offensive coordina-
tor Rocky Rees. “He helped me to learn
to read blocks and he always points out
intricacies of the game.”

He credits Curtis with helping him
with the mental aspects of his game.
“Coach Curtis helps my psyche. He tells
us when we don’t do a good job. He lays
it on the line every week, but he also
knows how to instill confidence.”

According to Curtis, Jenkins is a hard
worker in practice. He is also diligent
during the off season, lifting weights and
running.

Jenkins said, “I used the Nautilus
machines for two years, but now I use
free weights. Free weights give me the
additional bulk I need to break tackles
more effectively.”

Curtis agreed, commenting, “For a kid
of 175-180 pounds he has good strength
—he’ll punish people.”

Jenkins added, “After the season, I'll
get right back to the weights and Tl
probably run winter and spring track.”

Although Jenkins doesn’t try to imitate :

other runners, he said, “If there is some-
one I would like to run like it would be
Wilbert Montgomery (of the Philadelphia
Eagles). He’s a slashing runner, he doesn’t
mind getting hit and he always bounces
back.”

“Ken’s keys are that he has a good
feeling for where the hole will open. He
has tremendous acceleration getting
through it once he sees it,” Curtis re-
marked.

“He’s very deceptive—defensive players
see him coming and figure they'll get to
the right place to knock him down but
they have no idea he'll shift into another
gear and be past them,” Curtis continued.

Jenkins has already been contacted by
several NFL teams, but he has mixed
emotions about pro football. “Right now,
I’m not pro material, | need to learn
more. But, hands down, I'd take a shot
at it if I get the chance.”

Assessing Jenkins’ pro potential, Curtis
said, “In my coaching career here and at
F&M, the first person I saw who was
super was Billy ‘White Shoes’ Johnson
(now playing for the Houston Oilers). I
see some similarity between the two.”

Although Johnson was faster, he
“wasn’t as shifty and didn’t have the
cuts” Jenkins has.

“Two National Football League scouts
went to the Brown game to look at two
of Brown’s linebackers, but came away
with Jenkins on their mind,” Curtis
added.

Last summer Jenkins worked out with
the late Harold McClinton, formerly a
linebacker for the Washington Redskins.
“He told me that I have plenty of talent
but that the NFL teams ‘have-to need
you.” ”

Jenkins has received praise from several
opposing coaches this year.

Colgate graduate assistant coach Paul
D’Aloia, a 1980 Bucknell graduate and
former teammate of Jenkins said, “We
played Penn State and I would rate Ken
in the same class as Curt Warner (the
Nittany Lions highly touted halfback). He
is superior to most of the Ivy League
backs we’ve played against because he
does so many things well.”

“I have the utmost respect for him,”
said Cornell coach Bob Blackman. “He
has great acceleration, can shift gears and
knows how to pick his way. Not only is
he a good broken field runner, he’s also
tough inside.”

Blackman added, “He is as good as
anybody we've played this year.” Cor-
nell’s schedule includes all eight Ivy
League schools plus Rutgers and Colgate.

Looking to next year Curtis said, “The
only goal I want to set is to see him im-
prove, to keep on getting better.”

How much better?

“I don’t believe he’s anywhere near his
potential,” Curtis concluded.

Swimming tops relay records

By JEANNE MINAHAN

The men’s swimming team opened their season in
superior fashion Saturday as they set three meet
records and won six of 12 events at the Lafayette
Relays. Although team scores for the meet are unof-
ficial, the squad was easily the class of the 10 team
field.

The 400, 500 and 1,500-yard freestyle relay teams
all set meet records while the 300-yard backstroke,
300-yard butterfly and 800-yard freestyle teams
were also victorious.

Team captain Pat Mitchell ’81, Tim Jenkins ’83
and Andy Stewart ’84 set a new 1,500-yard freestyle
relay mark of 14:42.9, easily surpassing the
previous record of 14:56.55.

Mitchell, Jenkins, Stewart and Keith Hughes ’84
captured first in the 500-yard freestyle relay in
4:17.8, breaking the old mark of 4:18.9. Mitchell,

Jenkins, Stewart and Rich Callaghan ’84 broke the
old 400-yard freestyle mark en route to another first
place.

The 300-yard butterfly team composed of
sophomores Jenkins, Tom Kane and Dave Wakely
placed first with splits of 54.3, 55.4 and 54.1, respec-
tively. The 300-yard backstroke team of Chris
Layton ’81, Mark Bongiorno ’83 and Doug
Haverland ’84 were also victorious with 55.5, 56.8
and 56.8 second splits, respectively.

The 800-yard freestyle team of Mitchell (1:48.8),
Stewart (1:48.8), Callaghan (1:49.23) and Dave
Gassert ’83 (1:50.9) was the final winning relay for
the Bisons.

In addition, divers Tim Critchfield ’83 and Doug
Edmeads ’84 combined to take second place in one
meter springboard diving.

3-1 loss ends season

for field hockey

By JEFF CROSS
“Tt just wasn’t our day,”
reflected field hockey coach
Sally Starr.

Despite earning second seed
in the EAIAW Division II
regional tournament last
weekend, the Bisons were
eliminated with a 3-1 loss to
seventh seeded Drexel in the
first round last Friday in
Baltimore.

The loss snapped a seven
game unbeaten streak for the
squad, which finished 8-7-1.
Drexel eventually lost 4-2 to
LaSalle, the top seed, in the
tournament final to close at 8-
2-2.

Starr said “We seemed to be
prepared. I was confident,”
but added, ‘We probably
played one of our worst games.
of the year.” Co-captain Jill
Henry ’81 commented,
“Maybe we were too worried
about the games after it—we
were looking ahead too
much.”

Nancy Dill ’84 opened the
scoring by deflecting
freshman Sue Lenker’s
centering pass by Drexel
goaltender Carole Syke in the
first half. However, Drexel
evened the contest in the same
half and scored two
unanswered goals in the se-
cond half to move into the
semifinals of the eight team
tournament.

The Bisons were outshot 21-
10 and had but eight corners to
16 for their opponents. Offen-
sively, the team’s problem
was being “unable to break
down their defense where they
were vulnerable,” according
to Starr. The coach added,
“We weren’t reacting well.”

Henry summarized the
disappointing result stating,
“We just didn’t seem to get it
together. We were basically
outplayed as a team.”

Dill, Lenker and Jeanne
Minahan ’83 ‘‘all played well”
according to Starr. Goal-
tender Betsy Doyle ’82 record-
ed 14 saves and “played a
really good game,” Henry
commented.

Despite the abrupt and
disappointing exit from post
season action, “Just the fact
that we were able to put on a
late season surge’ was of
some consolation to Starr.
Henry stated, “I’m really
proud of the way we turned it
around.”

The key to the winning
streak, which began with a 1-0
triumph over Lehigh Oct. 18,
was “‘the offense started mov-
ing better. They started pass-
ing well with each other and
became goal hungry” ac-
cording to Henry. ‘‘The
defense played well all
season,’’ she added.

Ruggers split in EPRU tourney

By DAVE LIONETTE

The Bucknell All-Blacks
defeated the Philadelphia
Medical School 19-15 in the first
round of the 15-team Eastern
Pennsylvania Rugby Union
Championship tournament in
Princeton, N.J. Saturday, but
were eliminated from further ac-
tion with a 12-0 setback to Lehigh
in their second match.

The All-Blacks were assessed
an obstruction penalty on the
opening kick-off against
Philadelphia that set up a three
point penalty kick by their op-
ponents. The ruggers battled
right back to tie the match 3-3 on
a penalty kick by Stephen Dixon
81.

Philadelphia jumped in front

by 6-3 on another penalty kick
and upped their lead to 12-3 by
converting on an errant All-Black
pass late in the first half.

The ruggers were more aggres-
sive as the second half opened
and soon closed the gap to 12-6 on
another Dixon penalty kick. After
John Demas ’82 set up a five-yard
scrum with a 50-yard kick, the
All-Blacks’ pack pushed
Philadelphia into their own end
zone where Jeff McConnell ’81
pounced on a loose ball for a try.
The conversion evened the match
at 12-12.

However, Philadelphia retook
the lead at 15-12 with a penalty
kick minutes later. The ruggers
kept up the pressure and Steve

One way to measure a team’s
character is its ability to bounce
back after a disappointing per-
formance. The water polo squad
demonstrated theirs with a con-
vincing first-place finish last
weekend at the MAL Champion-
ship Tournament at Fordham
University.

The victory followed a fifth-
place showing at the AAU Indoor
Championships, where the Bisons
came ‘“‘close but just couldn’t put
those games away,” according to
senior goaltender Tony Paxton.
They made no mistake about the
outcome this time, outscoring
their four opponents by a 74-34
margin.

“We played well; up to our
capacity,” commented coach
Dick Russell, noting ‘‘none of the
games were in doubt.”

In the opener, Mark Gen-
sheimer ’81 notched eight goals
and an assist to lead the Bisons to
a resounding 19-5 win over Cor-
nell. Mark Corl ’81 tallied four
times and Paxton turned in a fine
performance in goal with eight
saves.

Paced by senior Scott Schulte’s
five goals, and an eleven-point
game (including six goals) by
Tom Butler ’82, the Herd ham-
mered Army 20-9 in game two.
Noted Paxton, ‘“‘We showed a lot
more cohesiveness — we got
everybody into the offense.”’ Gen-
sheimer chipped in eight points,
including five assists.

Commenting on the team’s
ability to get psyched up for a
weak opponent after having
destroyed many .of them
previously, Paxton said, ‘It’s not
a problem — we do a good job
with our mental attitude.”

The outcome was familiar in
game three as the Bisons paved
their way to the final by thump-
ing Slippery Rock 20-12. Paxton
and Mike Hoffman ’83 split the

goaltending chores, yielding six
goals each.

Schulte led the team in scoring
with seven tallies, while Gen-
sheimer fired six past the ‘‘rock”’
goalie. Butler added five assists
en route to the victory, which set
up a showdown with a tough For-
dham team.

Fordham, the only team ex-
pected to challenge the squad,
upset Bucknell 9-8 last year on a
goal with 40 seconds remaining to
cop first place in the MAC tourna-
ment.

The Bisons got revenge this
time, however, with a 15-8 vic-
tory. Gensheimer and Schulte led
the scoring with five goals apiece
as the Bisons jumped out to a 4-1
lead after one period.

That was as close as Fordham
would get, as the squad opened its
lead to 11-6 by the end of the third
frame. Fordham did manage to
outshoot Bucknell 30-27, but Pax-
ton’s 15 saves kept them at bay.

Chris Layton ’81 turned in an
exceptional defensive per-
formance for Bucknell. Layton,
who as eighth field player has not
seen much action this season,
was called upon after Dave In-
glefield ’82 had fouled out.

The Bisons return to Fordham
this weekend for the Eastern
Championships. The Bisons are
seeking their fourth-straight
Eastern title and take the pool
against Washington & Lee in the
first game at 9 a.m., Friday.

The Bisons are top-seeded and
Russell says he ‘expects to win.”
Paxton adds, “We know deep
down that we’re better than the
other teams,” adding, ‘‘We’ve
beaten everyone except Loyola.”

A victory in the Eastern Cham-
pionships will mean a trip to the
NCAA Championships Nov. 28-9
in Long Beach, California. The
squad finished fifth at the
NCAA’s in 1979.

Colgate matches last-minute Bison score for victory

From FOOTBALL, page 24

On the play, Colgate freshman
Rich Erenberg, running his own
pass route, inadvertently knock-
ed down safety Jim Gush ’81,
preventing Gush from covering
Rogers. Rogers then caught the
ball on the Bucknell 35 while com-
ing back towards his quarter-
back, cut to his right to avoid
defensive halfback Doug Smoot
’82 who was racing over to assist
Gush, and outraced Bison
defenders to the goal line and set
off a jubilant celebration on the
visitors’ sideline.

Curtis said, ‘It was one play
that turned a super second half
into a loss,” adding, ‘We deserv-
ed to win the ball game on our ef-
fort in the second half.”

The Bison coach remarked of
the solemn locker room after the
game, “I was at a loss for words.

12-play. 82-yard ‘rive.

Rogers, entering the game as
the 14th leading NCAA Division I-
A receiver, made a one-handed
grab to atone for his dropped pass
when wide open in the end zone on
the previous play.

On their first possession of the
second half, the Herd marched 80
yards in 14 plays to close the gap
to 10-7 when Jenkins bolted nine
yards to the left side of the end
zone cn third down.

The touchdown was Jenkins’
14th of the season, breaking the
single season mark held by both
Brad Myers and Burt Talmage
during the 1951 season.

Early in the fourth quarter,
Ken Durr ’82 recovered his se-
cond Colgate fumble one play
after making a touchdown-saving
tackle on Erenberg’s punt return,
but the ensuing Bisons drive end-

‘It was one play that turned a super second half
-Head Coach Bob Curtis

into a loss.’

I don’t think anything I could
have said would have made any
difference.”

The first half belonged to the
Red Raiders as they built a 10-0
lead while limiting the Herd to
three first downs and 50 yards in
total offense.

Colgate’s first points came ona
40-yard field goal from Brian
Byrne midway through the first
quarter. Then, with under five
minutes left in the half, Schuchts
lobbed an ll-yard touchdown
strike to Rogers, culminating an

ed with sophomore fullback Mar-
shall Hall’s fumble.

On their next possession, the
gridders drove to the Colgate 15-
yard line behind the running of
Jenkins and Hall. The key play of
the drive was a 21-yard pass com-
pletion from Locey to halfback
Steve Zenda ’83 at the Colgate 31.

However, the drive stalled and
Bill Grennon ’82 lined up to at-
tempt a 32-yard field goal to tie
the score. Amazingly, Grennon
flubbed the kick, a mistake that
later would prove fatal.

Curtis observed, ‘‘He hit it off
the front of his foot and never
followed through.” The Bison
mentor, in retrospect, stated,
“Possibly, we should have let
Alvin (Depew ’81) try it. We went
for the kicker who had length.”’
Depew is the extra point kicker
for the squad. Grennon did
manage to connect on a 44-yard
try en route to winning ECAC
Division I-AA Rookie of the Week
honors against Slippery Rock
Sept. 20.

After tri-captain Joe Catalano
’81 broke up a Schuchts aerial to
stall the next Red Raider drive.
freshman Dave Kucera returned
a punt 31 yards to the Bucknell 39-
yard line.

Only 1:46 showed on the clock
as the Bisons began their final
scoring thrust. On second-and-
one, Kucera brought the crowd to
its feet when he hauled in a Locey
screen pass and battled his way
to the Colgate 14 with a 37-yard
gain.

gate Saturday. Durr has a 37.3-yard punting average and has

made 73 tackles at linebacker this season.

BOOKS HAS NOW ARRIVED AT...

Two plays later, Locey, who
took over the Bison helm when
Ed Hughes ’83 injured a knee in
the third quarter, overthrew
Kucera in the end zone on third-
and-17. This set up the aforemen-
tioned completion to Jenkins on
fourth down that left the Bisons
four yards from a seemingly
miraculous come from behind
victory.

Although Locey connected on
only three of nine passes, he
directed both scoring drives and
showed added confidence over
earlier outings. Curtis com-
mented, ‘‘Al was extremely
determined to prove himself.’”’

Locey lost his starting spot
when Hughes returned from a
knee injury but, ‘“He came back.
He showed what being a com-
petitor is,” the coach said.

Red Raider quarterback
Schuchts passed for 305 yards on
19 completions. Curtis remarked,
“They felt they could throw the
ball on us,” but added, “What
(the Colgate coaches) were real-
ly saying was ‘We’re going to
have trouble running on
Bucknell’.””. The stingy Bison
defense allowed an average of 148
rushing yards per game prior to
Colgate and allowed the Red
Raiders only 104.

Curtis concluded, “The most
important thing for (our coaches)
to get across is that we’ve got to
hang tough. We can’t be
destroyed by one play.”

The football team closes its
season at 1:30 p.m., Saturday
against Boston University. For a

fensive leader. Leslie, named to
the 1980 All-ECC first team and
the U.S. Basketball Writers’ All-
District squad, averaged 20.9
points per game last season and
was the top Bison scorer in 15 of
their 27 games.

Providing leadership and an
array of exciting offensive
moves, Leslie holds seven
University basketball records.
Among them are most points in a
game (45) and most points in a
season (564), both set last year.
In addition, Leslie needs just 374
points to pass Barry as the career
scoring leader.

Woollum said of Leslie, ‘““You’ll
be watching one of the best
basketball players in this part of
the country.”

Seniors Dave Shehadi and Paul
Adkins, sophomore Jay Wright
and freshman Carl Cosimano are
still competing for the other
backcourt spot. Woollum com-
mented, ‘The spot will go to the
guy that performs the best.”

Shehadi and Adkins have both
earned two varsity letters and
last year averaged 6.2 and 3.2
minutes of play, respectively.
Wright has played “extremely
well” in practice game conditions
according to the coach and was
the playmaker on the junior var-
sity squad a year ago. Cosimano
averaged 17 points and 12 re-
bounds per game as a high school
senior last season.

The only player assured of a
starting berth in the front court is
6-foot-7 center Deb Okorodudu
82. Okorodudu had only 14 re-
bounds in 66 total minutes last
year but is expected by the coach
to do the bulk of the rebounding
and serve as the outlet man to in-
stigate the fast break.

The contest for the two forward

positions is being waged by
senior Mike Page, junior Paul
Harrison and sophomores Craig
Cody and Ray Moss. Page and
Harrison saw limited action with
the varsity while Cody and Moss
held down spots on the 12-4 junior
varsity squad last year.

Realizing the inexperience in
actual game situations by most
team members, Woollum none-
theless stated, ‘“‘They’re ex-
perienced in the sense of being
around,” and adds ‘‘They’ve
been working ‘hard. They know
what it takes to win.”

The Bisons host the Portugese
National Team in an exhibition
game at 8 pm, tonight, in Davis
Gym. The Portugese are on a
playing tour of the East Coast
and are expected to provide top
notch competition.

The game, played under inter-
national rules, will be a ‘‘good ex-
perience” for the Bisons and an
‘opportunity to broaden
ourselves’? according to
Woollum.

The coach “plans to win but
also have a good look at every-
thing we’ve got.” The starting
lineup will be Okorodudu at
center, Page and Moss at for-
ward and Leslie with Shehadi at
guard. Woollum warned, ‘‘There
is no indication this will be the
starting lineup against Virginia
(in the regular season opener
Nov. 28).””

Woollum hopes the University
community will support the inter-
national contest since con-
siderable efffort was expended in
bringing the Portuguese team to
Lewisburg. The Bison mentor
would like to see another Iron
Curtain national team play an ex-
hibition game against the Bisons
in the future, as the Yugoslavian
national squad did two years ago.

Soccer ends year on sour note

By BRIAN FETTERHOFF
Elizabethtown handed the soccer squad a 2-1 set-
back Tuesday to close a disappointing 4-7-2 season
for the Bisons. The loss was preceded by a trium-
phant 1-0 blanking of Lehigh last Friday in the
booters’ home final game.

With just under nine minutes gone at
Elizabethtown Tuesday, the Bisons opened the scor-
ing when Brian Hassinger ’83 scored on an assist to
Peter Mullany ’84. The goal occurred on a “mixup
between the goalie and the fullback,” Hassinger
said. “It was a case of being in the right place
at the right time,” he added.

The Bisons ‘passed really well’ in the first half
according to Doug Hitchner ’83, but couldn’t score
again. E-town, highly ranked in division III, tied the
contest at 34:53 of the first half when Orlando
Rodriguez scored off a corner kick with goaltender
Pete Puccia ’81 caught out of position.

The booters ‘didn’t control as well” in the second
half, according to Hitchner, and eventually sur-
rendered the winning goal when Mike Boess knock-
ed in a pass from Fred Potts with only 8:36 remain-
ing. Hassinger observed, ‘We played right with
them until the last 10 minutes when they started to
dominate.” Hitchner added, ‘Our substitutes

Herd to play Boston

penetrated and got off some good shots in the clos-
ing minutes.”

The contest against Lehigh, designated ‘Universi-
ty Game of the Week’ by the East Coast Conference
prior to the season, lived up to its billing as the
Bisons battled to a sweet 1-0 victory. Reynolds com-
mented, “It was a controlled game and not at all
lopsided.” The Bisons outshot the Engineers 14-12.

The decisive goal came 14 minutes into the action
when Duncan Lee ’83 chipped home a pass from
Mark Brotherton ’83. Brotherton, the Bisons’
leading scorer this season, was selected by the
referees as Player of the Game for his solid,
mistake-free effort at midfield.

Goaltender Puccia and Paul Green ’82 each played
one half and came up with big saves in one on one
situations, according to Hitchner.

Hassinger expressed frustration over the
mediocre season, stating, “We were in every
game—we just didn’t finish right.” The squad
scored more than one goal on only four occasions
and four of its seven losses were by a single goal.

The team will lose most of the defense including
co-captains Peter Christian and Bruce Marcey, yet
Hassinger is optimistic concerning next season.
“The big thing is our scoring. If we can finish our
plays, we’ll be tough.”

The Bisons have a chance for
their best record since 1972 when
they close their 1980 season
against Boston University at 1:30
p.m. Saturday in Memorial
Stadium.

The Terriers are ‘“‘as good as
any team on our schcdule”’ ac-
cording to Bison Head Coach Bob
Curtis. Their 8-1 record includes
a 28-24 last-minute victory over
Connecticut last Saturday to
clinch the Yankee Conference ti-
tle with a 5-0 record. The Bisons
were crushed 38-7 by UConn in
their season opener Oct. Sept. 13

Curtis remarked, “A win

Gridders lose 17-14 to Colg

ate on last-minute score

By JEFF CROSS

Former New York Yankee manager Yogi Berra, after a particular-
ly disheartening defeat, once said, ‘The game isn’t over till it’s over.”

His remark immediately came to mind Saturday after the Bisons
watched a hard-earned 14-10 lead over Colgate slip from their grasp by
surrendering a last-gasp 58-yard touchdown pass with only 12 seconds
remaining to fall 17-14 at Memorial Stadium.

Bison fans were still buzzing after quarterback Al Locey ’83 capped
a spirited comeback by sneaking over the goal line from four yards out
to give the Herd a 14-10 advantage with 43 seconds showing on the
clock. Head Coach Bob Curtis commented, ‘They were defensing a
quick pitch to Jenkins on one side and a sweep to the other.”’

Setting up the go-ahead score was the best executed play ina
pressure filled situation of the season. Curtis simply said of the fourth-
and-17 call on the Red Raider 21-yard line, ‘‘You gotta make it or else
we lose. We knew who we were going to.” Ken Jenkins ’82 stated,
“Everyone in the huddle knew we could do it.”

Locey dropped back, looked to his downfield receivers to freeze the
defenders, then dumped a screen pass to halfback Jenkins on the left
side. Jenkins accelerated straight ahead, cut to the outside to avoid
the two Red Raiders covering him on the play, then thundered for
more yardage before being dragged down at the 4-yard line. The
perfectly executed play gave the gridders renewed hope with a first
down and astonished the boisterous crowd.

Curtis remarked, ‘Ken did a heck of a job sitting there waiting
before he drifted outside,’ adding, ‘He didn’t do anything I didn’t
think he could do.”’ Earlier in the drive, Jenkins set a new school single
season rushing mark with 1,079 yards.

On the next series, however, Colgate stunningly recaptured the lead
on a 58-yard pass and run play from quarterback Wayne Schuchts to
split end Tom Rogers that left 2,500 mouths agape.

X-country wins ECC’s

Bisons sweep to sixth straight conference ttle

By ROB STETZ

The men’s cross country team captured their
sixth consecutive East Coast Conference crown
Saturday by outracing nine teams over the 5.1 mile
Belmont Plateau layout in Philadelphia.

The meet was won in machine-like fashion as
seven Bison runners finished in the top 10 places.
Delaware and St. Joseph’s were the Orange and
Blue’s closest challengers, finishing with team
scores of 72 and 84 points, respectively, to trail well
behind the 22 points of Bucknell.

Bill Reifsnyder ’84, the top Bison finisher in every
race this fall, crossed the finish line first in 25
minutes, 41.9 seconds, only seven seconds shy of the
course record and 15 seconds ahead of St. Joseph’s
John Crooke, the second place runner.

The remaining top 10 runners for the Bisons were
Rick Sayre ’82 (third in 26:03), Doug Pickell 82
(fifth in 26:10), Jim O’Shea ’81 (sixth in 26:11),
Mark Hulme ’83 (seventh in 26:12), Mike Debraggio
’81 (ninth in 26:22) and Steve Bigotto ’82 (10th in
26:24).

Coach Art Gulden stated, ‘‘We ran a flat, emo-
tionless race but our hard work throughout the week
really paid off.”

The Bison junior varsity squad took the first 12
places and 14 of the first 15 to totally dominate the
J.V. race. Rich Coffin ’82 won the contest in 27:05.

The harriers compete in the NCAA District II
qualifying meet 11 a.m. Saturday on the Lehigh
course, and from there the top five teams will ad-
vance to the NCAA Championships Nov. 24 in
Wichita, Kansas. The Bisons finished fourth in the
qualifying race last fall and were 17th place
finishers in the NCAA Championships.

Among the squads vying for the top five spots will
be nationally third-ranked Penn State and highly
regarded Villanova, a team the Bisons upset to cap-
ture the IC4A Championships Oct. 20 in New York
City’s Van Cortlandt Park.

Gulden predicts, ‘If we run the way we’ve been
running, we should qualify. The thing is, we do not
have to win the meet. It is only a qualifier.”

Breakin’ Bisons open Friday

By DAVE KIRKPATRICK

After losing to graduation four-
year starters Bob Barry (the
University career scoring
leader), forward Steve Sigl
(ninth leading career scorer) and
playmaking guard Pat Flannery
(career assists leader), plus
three other lettermen, the basket-
ball team might appear destined
for a rebuilding year. Indeed,
Head Coach Charlie Woollum
concedes, ‘‘We’ll never replace
what those guys did for the pro-
gram.”

However, nine returning let-
termen from last season’s 20-7
ECC West division winning squad
return to give the team hope for
another successful campaign.

Woollum notes, ‘‘We’ll depend
on a tenacious man to man
defense and our usual fast break-
ing offense.’ He adds, ‘‘The kids
have plenty of confidence in the
system and I have confidence in
their ability to execute it.”

BU to install lights at crossing

By JAN BALAKIAN

The University will install two 250 watt lights at
the intersection of Route 15 and Moore avenue next
month, according to Physical Plant Director John
Bell.

The lights and their installation are expected to
cost $500, Bell said. The fixtures will extend six feet
from traffic light poles at the intersection, ac-
cording to instructions for installation from the
Pennsylvania Department of Transportation
(PennDOT). :

Vice President for Administration and Finance
John Zeller wrote to PennDOT Sept. 29, requesting
permission to install a flashing warning light in ad-
dition to the existing traffic light. The Department
of Transportation denied his request because it said
the traffic light at the crossing is visible from more
than 500 feet and therefore a warning light is un-
necessary. PennDOT responded to Zeller’s request
ina letter dated Oct. 20.

Zeller said he does not favor the building of a
bridge or tunnel. Questioning whether students
would use the tunnel, he said he has “‘seen no study
that proves that a bridge or a tunnel would ap-
propriately solve the problem.” Zeller said a tunnel
would be dark and prompt muggings. He also said
since a tunnel would probably be constructed below
the creek, running past the intersection, flooding
would be likely to occur.

Zeller said the construction of either a bridge or a
tunnel must include provisions for the handicapped.
He said such provisions, which include the construc-
tion of ramps, would detract from the aesthetics of
the bridge, and cost an exorbitant amount of
money.

Mary McNerney '81, who was struck by a car on
the night of Sept. 23 while walking her bicycle
across the intersection, is now at home recu-
perating.

tween juniors Michael Suarez

A job offer to fill the newly
created position of Director of
Security and Safety here has
been offered to 34-year-old David
Castilow, the current assistant
director of security at the Univer-
sity of Nebraska.

The University has asked
Castilow to begin working Jan. 1,
and although a contract has yet to
be signed, Castilow is expected to
accept the offer.

Vice President for Administra-
tion and Finance John Zeller said
he expected to receive a signed
contract from Castilow in
Wednesday’s mail. He said he
spoke with Castilow Monday and
had “every reason to think he will
sign.”

Castilow said Tuesday,
however, that such an assump-
tion would be “premature.” He
said the University and he have

reached a “preliminary deci-

sion,” and although he ‘“‘foresees
returning the contract,” he said
he is ‘‘still negotiating.”

“J sent back my reply to
Bucknell yesterday,’ Castilow
said Thursday. He refused to con-
firm or deny having signed the
contract, because it is still in the
mail system, and Zeller does not
know his response yet.

Chief of Security Norman Fine
will be allowed to retain his job
with the University, but will be
subordinate to the new director.
Zeller said Fine would not be
forced to retire, but said that he
“hoped” he would “‘see the light”
and do so.

Zeller said he has not received
word from Fine whether he will
retire or not. Fine has ‘“‘told
others”’ that he will retire at the
end of the year, but he ‘“‘hasn’t
given usa date,” Zeller said.

Fine has said he will retire Dec.

Stuart Rothenberg, former visiting assistant professor of
political science, speaks in the UC Forum Monday.

Rothenberg returns to
e e 9
campus in ‘mainstream

By TRICIA KENNEDY
Stuart Rothenberg told a packed University Center Forum au-
dience Monday night that conservatism has become part of the

“mainstream of American thought”

tion sweep Nov. 4.

following the Republican elec-

Rothenberg, a visiting assistant professor of political science
here from 1977 until June of this year, said that he had once felt like

a “political stranger” at Bucknell, but

that times have changed.

“T woke up on November 5 and said, Hey, I’m in the mainstream
of America now. Before, when I was at Bucknell, I was thought of

as the weirdo,” he said.

Rothenberg, who now serves as the associate editor of the weekly

“Political Report”

published by the Free Congress Foundation in

Washington, delighted the audience at the beginning of the 90-
minute lecture by pounding the podium as he spoke, a gesture
familiar to his former students here.

Rothenberg lectures on GOP

From ROTHENBERG, page 1.

When asked how he believes
President-elect Reagan’s policies
will affect college students,
Rothenberg predicted that stu-
dent loans, tuition tax credits and
subsidies for colleges in general
will be cut. Rothenberg said the
Reagan administration will
“Kill” the Department of Educa-
tion.

Rothenberg’s conservative
analysis of the GOP sweep was
based on four assumptions:
widespread anti-Carter senti-
ment, rejection of the Demo-
cratic party, opposition to
liberalism and the growing power
of the so-called ‘“‘new right”
movement.

The apparent shift of the
public’s attitude to a more con-
servative philosophy is based
more on actual dissatisfaction
with the liberal candidates,
however, Rothenberg said the
new administration believes

there should be less interference
by groups like the Equal Employ-
ment Opportunity Commission
(EEOC) and that affirmative ac-
tion programs will be ‘‘severely
limited” as a result.

Rothenberg said ‘‘discrimina-
tion on account of race and sex is
wrong.” He also said groups
“dike the EEOC and affirmative
action programs foster racial and
sex discrimination.”

Rothenberg’s comment re-
called the controversy last spring
when the University hired Linda
Thomas to replace him as an in-
structor of political science here.
She was chosen in order to bring
an element of “diversity” to the
faculty here, according to Chair-
man of the Department and Asso-
ciate Professor of Political
Science John Peeler.

Peeler has said the faculty is
“overwhelmingly composed of
white males and a black woman
would provide a needed diversi-

_ sweep, and American politics

Y-Rothenberg gained campus-
wide attention when he criticized
this action by the University.

Only three current faculty
members—Peeler, Thomas and
Associate Professor of Religion
William Becker—attended the
lecture.

After his speech entitled
“Ronald Reagan and the New
Right, or Bye Bye Birch Bayh,”
Rothenberg said he hoped he had
been invited back as ‘‘a serious
commentator, not as a former
professor or a performer.”

The presentation was spon-
sored by the local chapter of
Omicrom Delta Kappa, a na-
tional collegiate leadership
organization.

In introducing Rothenberg,
ODK President David Polsky ’81
said the lecturer “‘brings to this
campus a refreshingly different
perspective lacking now from the
campus.”

Story on hiring requested by Rothenberg stopped, not censored

By DAVID HAWKINGS

Stuart Rothenberg is still taking the offensive against
the University.

Though the controversy surrounding Rothenberg’s
claim of discrimination against him by Bucknell six mon-
ths ago has been forgotten by all but a few — including
Rothenberg — the former visiting assistant professor of
political science is still pursuing what he calls “‘some type
of satisfaction.”

Rothenberg now contends that administration officials
have “continued to let the issue die down’’ since his ap-
pointment was terminated in June, despite assurances
that his grievances would be aired “in a public forum.”

Fraternity rush ends

University President Dennis O’Brien made a “verbal
agreement”’ with Rothenberg, in May, that a story on af-
firmative action hiring policies would appear in Bucknell
World — the University’s alumni magazine — sometime
this fall, Rothenberg said. But the story has never ap-
peared, and Director of Public Relations and Publications
Roland King said this week the story is ‘“‘on hold.”

A story commissioned by the University and written by
a freelance writer, Marjie Fusco of Milton for a $75 fee,
however, was “too far off target’ and “didn’t hang
together well enough’”’ to be used for publication in the
eyes of King, O’Brien and Provost Wendell Smith, ac-
cording to King.

Although King said it was “abnormal” for ad-
ministrators to see Bucknell World stories before they
were printed — they did only because they were ‘‘directly
involved,” he said — the publication is not censored and
the story’s withdrawal had “nothing to do with
Rothenberg’s case.”

O’Brien also said the story had not been “‘pulled.””

Rothenberg said in an interview after his lecture Mon-
day night that the story’s “disappearance” means “‘it did
not present the case for affirmative action strongly
enough,” adding that he planned to write O’Brien a letter
complaining that the president “went back on our agree-
ment.”

as 70% of frosh join

More than 300 pledge 13 houses

MAUNINES

By LISA CERUTI
More than 300 men pledged
fraternities Sunday after eight
weeks of rush, with approximate-
ly 70 percent of the freshman
class accepting bids.

Names of fraternity pledges
listed. Page 4.

This percentage is consistent
with the record-breaking number
of men who pledged last year.

According to Stu Flavell ’81, In-
terfraternity Council vice presi-
dent, and rush chairman and a
member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon
fraternity, the pledges were
“pretty well spread out’? among
the houses. “I’m very pleased
that most of the houses that
needed to do well did and that the
whole rush system seemed to
work successfully,”’ Flavell said.

More than 80 percent of the
freshmen registered for rush, ac-
cording to IFC President Steve
Kohn ’81. The percentage of men
who eventually pledged was
almost exactly the same as last
year, despite some changes in the
rush system. Rush lasted eight
weeks this fall instead of the
usual nine.

In addition, each rushee was
required to formally register and
pay a $2 registration fee. The
money collected by the IFC was
used to defray Greek Weekend
expenses.

Sigma Chi fraternity took. the.

largest pledge class. with 57 men
accepting bids. 17 men pledged
Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity, a
dramatic upswing from last
year’s pledge class of one. Phi
Lambda Theta fraternity pledged
eight men and is the only house
that took fewer than twelve
plédges. Phi Beta Sigma fraterni-
ty in accordance with national
rules cannot rush until second
semester.

Flavell said although the
percentage of freshmen pledging
this fall is ‘‘almost identical to
the number last November,” this
year’s distribution of pledges was
more even.

He said, ‘Although there were
a lot of groans and some houses
felt that the guys were not very
enthusiastic, the freshmen pulled
through in the end.’ Flavell
added, ‘‘A couple of houses that
expected to do well didn’t
because they really didn’t seek
out the rushees.””

Although the pledges were
generally spread among the 13
fraternities participating in rush,
there was a wide range in the
ratios of extended bids to accep-
tances.

Flavell attributed this variance
to the different selection pro-
cedures used by each fraternity,
“Obviously, if you bid one out of
every five freshmen, the
resulting pledge class will be

The number of hot-water washing machines will be cut in half, beginning next month, in

an effort to conserve energy and save money.

Hot-water washers cut-back;
need for energy savings cited

By MADELON HENEHAN

The number of hot-water washing machines
available on campus will be reduced by 50 percent
beginning Dec. 1.

The University Committee on Energy Conserva-
tion prompted the move. The reasons for the cut-
back in the number of hot-water washers included a
need ‘‘to save the University money,’ to ‘‘conserve
energy,’ and to “promote awareness (of the energy
shortage),” according to Glen Tullman ’81, student
representative to the committee.

Of the 34 washing machines in the laundry rooms
of residential buildings, only 17 will supply hot
water. The buildings housing only one machine will
not lose their hot water, however. In dormitories
where five machines operate, such as in Swartz
Hall, three will operate only with cold water,
Tullman said.

“We don’t want to take away choice. That’s why

we’re not converting 100 percent,” Tullman said.
The reduction in the number of hot-water machines
will continue “forever, or as long as there is an
energy crisis,” said Assistant Director of the
Physical Plant and committee member Robert
Naugle. It is likely that no more than one hot water:
machine will be available in any residential
building by January, Naugle said. The conversion is
being made gradually.

“No capital investment” is involved in making
these changes, Naugle said.

According to Tullman, the University hopes to
eventually move to a system where people would
pay more for hot water and less for cold. ‘“‘Right)
now it’s not practical,” said Tullman, because it
would neccesitate making costly renovations to ex-
isting machines. Naugle said he could not estimate
the amount of energy likely to be conserved or the’
amount of money it is hoped will be sayed.. .

Campus security
changes expected

From SECURITY, page 1g

31 and he reiterated his plans for
retirement Tuesday. Fine said he
verbally told Zeller of his retire-
ment plans in June, and that he
has also notified the personnel of-
fice.

Asked if he would send a writ-
ten notice of his intentions to
Zeller, Fine responded ‘Why
should I tell Zeller®

Zeller said he cannot assume
Fine will retire until he receives a
written statement from him, but
Fine refused to comment about
the possibility of even issuing
Zeller a written notice.

Fine has served 18 years as
chief of security. He said he “still
thinks this is a good security staff
here,” and that he is “proud” of
his record.

His position will not be con-
tinued after he retires. Instead,
his rank will be filled by a
patrolman, Zeller said.

A reorganization of Campus
Security is expected to begin next
year. Castilow — ifhe accepts the
University’s job offer — will work
to make the force ‘‘more profes-
sional,”’ Zeller said.

Zeller did not refer specifically
to Castilow, however, and re-
fused to reveal his identity
because he has yet to accept the
job offer.

Castilow was referred to only
as being from a “midwestern
state institution.”

Structural changes in the
operation of security here are ex-
pected to include a new ‘“‘pattern
of operation” with ‘“‘someone on
duty 24 hours a day, seven days a
week,” Zeller said.

Castilow said Thursday there is
“room for change at Bucknell.”
He said if he accepts the post, he
would like to see ‘‘people-
oriented things that are not done
know.”

He listed ‘crime prevention
programs” and an “escort ser-
vice” as programs he would like
to introduce.

A shift in the job emphasis of
patrolmen away from the distinc-
tion of ‘night watchmen”’ and to
one of campus patrollers is
planned. Zeller said although he
wants the force to be profes-
sional, he said he does not mean
the same type of professionalism
that exists at the municipal level.

He said he is concerned with

the safety of students and does
not want them arrested when
they can be helped.

Perhaps as a reflection of this
change in emphasis, the name of
the department has been
changed. Formerly “Campus
Security,” the unit is now known
as “Security and Safety.” Zeller,
although admitting he is trving to
change the “‘image”’ of security,
said the image change should be
accompanied by a change in
“substance.” He said he wants
security here to be seen as
“highly qualified.”

“We want students to have con-
fidence in Security,” Zeller said.

A new security office located
“Gn the center of campus” is also
planned. Zeller said the new of-
fice would be in an existing
building and would serve the
campus more effectively than the
present one in the physical plant.
Zeller ruled out the University
Center as a possibility.

Security will also be an
autonomous department next
year, and will not report to the
director of the physical plant, he
said.

Physical Plant Director John
Bell now oversees the security
operation, but next year, the
security director would report on-
ly to Zeller.

Castilow has degrees in cam-
pus law enforcement and “‘would
be qualified to teach law enforce-
ment if we offered it,” Zeller
said.

A search committee chaired by
Dean of Student Affairs John
Dunlop screened candidates for
the position of Director of Securi-
ty and Safety, and chose Castilow
as its prime candidate two weeks
ago. Members of the committe in-
cluded Director of Residen!:.1!
Life Brenda Gordon, Assoviite
Professor of Sociology Matthew
Silberman, Bell and two rece:!!
alumni.

Although Fine and Assistant
Chief of Security Mike Amarante
were not on the committee, they
were allowed to meet Castilow
recently.

Zeller said they did ‘‘not real-
ly” have any say in hiring
Castilow, however.

After meeting him, Fine said
Castilow would be a ‘‘credit to
Bucknell,” and that he is “well
qualified.”

w patrolmen hired; replace

two officers fired ‘for cause’

By MATT KARANIAN

Vacancies created on the
Security staff when Zeller fired
two patrolmen ‘‘for cause”’ Sept.
19 have been filled after having
left the staff undermanned for
nearly two months.

Zelier announced Tuesday the
University has hired Francis
Maresca of Riverside and James
Middleton of Harrisburg to fill
the vacant patrolman positions.

Maresca is a retired New York
City police officer. He served 20
years on the force there before
taking a position with the River-
side Borough police department
two years ago.

M:ddleton is a recent graduate
of the Harrisburg Area Com-
munity College. He graduated
wiih an associate degree in police
administration and has worked
for the Burns Security Agency in
Harrisburg.

among 80 candidates for the two
vacant positions. Amarante, Fine

Civil rights urged in
address by Carter

Asserting that his plans on
behalf of human rights in Latin
America will outlive his ad-
ministration, President Carter
indirectly encouraged President-
elect Reagan to continue his ef-
forts when he takes office.

In his first formal speech since
his defeat in the election, Carter
explained he is “convinced a new
conscience has awakened’’
regarding civil rights as a univer-
sal concept.

White House officials said
Carter’s statements were raised
to counter Reagan’s accusations
during the campaign that the
United States has been trying to
impose its moral beliefs on other
countries.

Carter also urged a strict
policy of non-intervention in the
turbulent nations of Nicaragua
and El Salvador.

Senate approves a

busing use cutback

Disregarding last-minute pleas
by defenders of civil rights
legislature, the Senate passed a
bill, 51 to 35, Monday which could
cut the use of busing as a means
for school desegregation.

The bill would stop the Justice
Department, which has been a
driving force behind desegrega-
tion attempts in the past, from us-

ing funds to pursue legal cases in
order to put busing orders into ef-
fect.

Private interests, however,
could continue to bring segrega-
tion cases and the court would
still be able to impose ap-
propriate busing orders.

Cases that have already been
acted upon would not be affected
by this ruling.

Shooting deaths of

blacks investigated

The shooting deaths of four
blacks by policemen in New
Orleans early Wednesday morn-
ing is being investigated by
Federal, State, and Local agents,
two civil rights groups, and
several public interest organiza-
tions.

The mood surrounding the
deaths is one of fear, disbelief,
and anger, according to Rose
Loving, executive director of a
local community organization
there. The incident follows the
murder of a city patrolman
November 8.

Court bars prayers
in NY public schools

Emphasizing the ‘‘wall of
separation” between church and
state, a Federal appeals court
issued a decision Monday pro-
hibiting public school students
from holding prayer meetings in
school.

The case involves a group call-
ed the Students for Voluntary
Prayer from Guilderland High
School near Albany. According to
several judges, authorization of
prayer meetings would have
created ‘‘an improper ap-
pearance of official support” for
religion.

Recycling paper now
University policy

The University will officially
promote recycling of waste paper
as a result of a request from the
ABS. Receptacles will be placed*
in Vaughan Literature Building,
Marts Hall, and Dana Engineer-
ing, according to Vice President
of Administration and Finance,
John Zeller.

If this initial phase is suc-
cessful, it will be expanded to
other buildings, Zeller said. In
the past, the recycling of paper
from administrative and faculty
offices, and residence halls has
been voluntary.

Yearbook sales are up from last year, according to L’Agenda editor,

over 600 books were sold, Zimmerman said, with a surprising majority
purchased by the class of 1983.

With an overall sales goal of 1500 books, Zimmerman said he expects
to sell 900 by the end of the second campaign, which consists of letters
mailed to parents over Thanksgiving vacation. At the end of
Christmas vacation last year, a total of 800 books were sold, Zimmer-
man said.

A final sales campaign will be held in the spring, but the present
price of $13.50 per copy will be raised to a minimum of $16.00, co-sales
manager Ginny Bagley ’81 said. The cost of the book is kept low to en-
courage students to buy early, because first semester sales determine
the budget for the book, she said.

Three of Rothenberg’s criticisms are still pertinent

By TODD G. BUCHHOLZ

The greatest contribution
Stuart Rothenberg, former assis-
tant professor at Bucknell who
left last spring when his contract
was not renewed, made to Buck-
nell was to thrust in front of facul-
ty, students and administration
the faults of Bucknell academia.
Some applauded, some ignored
and some scorned him. In letters
and interviews in the Bucknellian
last semester, Rothenberg tried
to enlighten. Three of his primary
criticisms still apply and if we
are serious about education, we
will debate them before we pay a
$1000 increase in tuition.

First, the importance of
ideology: In a Bucknellian inter-
view with Rothenberg, I spec-
ulated ‘‘the U.S. could elect a
very conservative man to the
Presidency, while the Universi-
ty’s political science department
could be left without a single ex-
ponent of conservative philo-
sophy.” That was March 21, 1980.

Here we are. Are we deprived?
Is something missing? Yes. You
can’t expect liberal or leftists
who believe passionately in their
cause, to speak for the conser-
vatives. We call them professors
because they ‘“‘profess’’; they
preach what they’ve devoted
their lives to. Fine.

But when we want a debate
where do we find an alternative
this year? You could pile up lef-
tists in the economics and
political science departments
like you could pile uneaten lima
beans in the cafeteria.

Last year Rothenberg debated
Professor Richard Peterec on
South African divestment, Jim
Wilson ’81 on Washington D.C.
voting rights and Professor Tom
Travis on detente. Again, is
something missing this year? It
is irresponsible.

Second, the tenure system:
“The University is bound to con-
tinue with teachers who shouldn’t
be teaching. I think it hurts the
University more than it helps,”
Rothenberg said in March.
Here’s where faculty blood
pressure builds. All of us can
name professors we’ve been
warned about. In almost every
department there’s at least one
who is incompetent or worse. If
they are visiting professors, they
may not be rehired. If they are
tenured, we are stuck with them.

What does the administration
do? I asked President O’Brien at
an ABS meeting. He responded
that they may be subtly per-
suaded to retire, may be moved
to other positions, or may be
granted leaves to get them out of

the classroom and let them do
research.

How nice of the administration
to get them out of the classroom
and send them to Europe at our
expense. We have a choice be-
tween suffering through higher

THE
BUCH
STOP

tuition costs or suffering through
poor instruction.

At a Planning and Budget Com-
mittee meeting, Provost Wendell
Smith suggested increasing pro-
ductivity among faculty to justify
higher salaries. Professor Steve
Becker threw up his arms ex-
claiming: ‘‘How can you do that.
There’s no way! Productivity

doesn’t apply to academics.”

Dear professors, eliminating
incompetents is the first lesson in
applied productivity.

Finally, lack of intellectual en-
vironment: In an April 18, 1980
letter to the Bucknellian,
Rothenberg assailed the faculty
and students for not attending
Colloquy programs. He was cor-
rect in aiming his salvos at both.
Students seem content to com-
plete homework and go to frater-
nity parties. Faculty seem con-
tent to complete classwork and
gohome.

But isn’t the idea of a small
University in a small town based
on the premise that an academic
environment will be established?
Shouldn’t our goal be discussions
out of the classroom, at each
other’s homes, at the Bison, etc.?

To quote Rothenberg: ‘The
standard excuse will be that
family pressures made it im-
possible . . . These points are cer-
tainly valid. . . but, is it too much
to ask that faculty members find

two or three hours to attend at
least a couple of events?”

Professor John Anderson in a
memorandum to the Planning
and Budget Committee asserts
that ‘‘There is ample evidence
that faculty morale is already be-
ing affected by last year’s deci-
sion on compensation.’”’ Will
higher salaries raise morale and
get professors out of their
homes? Are these productivity
increases we can expect? How is
morale manifest anyway?

Stuart Rothenberg knows what
an academic environment should
be like. After his lecture, he and
his wife Elaine (Rusinko, former
assistant professor of Russian
here), Professor Dan Quinlan
and a small group of students
discussed ideologies, Bucknell
and politics over beer for about
three hours. That’s what the
University needs — people whose
minds remain open after the
books are closed and the
paychecks cashed. And that’s
what students should demand of
themselves — and of faculty.

Seeing the light

The prompt action by the University authorizing the installation
of two additional lights at the intersection of Route 15 and Moore
Avenue deserves recognition.

Within one week after a serious accident at the location, John
Zeller wrote a letter to the Pennsylvania Department of Transpor-
tation requesting that they place a warning flasher in the area.
After the agency refused, the University obtained permission to
install the 250 watt lights.

We commend this action, as it increases the likelihood of a safe
crossing by residents of Bucknell West, intramural participants
and many others. It is clearly the first step in the right direction.

What is needed now is a safety commitment on the part of those
who must cross at the intersection. People who dash across Route
15 wherever it is convenient rather than using the soon-to-be-

lighted crosswalk endanger themselves, other pedestrians, and

motorists.

Now that the University has taken action to insure student safe-
ty at this dangerous crossroad we must respond by acting safely
and responsibly.

Changing the image

The University will likely have a new Director of Security and
Safety in January. We’ll be getting a new man to fill a newly created
position: he will work to give the force a new image and to provide it
with new direction.

Even the names have been changed. We’ll have a ‘Director of
Security and Safety” and not a ‘‘Chief of Campus Security.”

In fact, the entire subject has a born-again flavor to it. But, as
John Zeller has said, change in substance is more important than a
mere change in image. We agree. And we are concerned that
although the names and faces may change, the real content may re-
main the same. :

The security staff here has traditionally been little more than a
group of night watchmen, conducting their business from sundown
to sunup. Some new blood in the security department could effective-
ly change this. There are plans for a shift in the emphasis of the job,
from that of mere watchmen to ‘‘24 hours a day, 7 days a week”’
patrolmen.

Other hoped for changes include moving the headquarters back on
campus, where it belongs, and out of the Physical Plant building.

David Castilow, of Omaha, Nebraska, a prime candidate for the
position as Director, agrees there is plenty of ‘room for change”
here. He would like to see security become more service oriented.
Among other ‘“‘people-oriented things”’ that he says are needed are a
crime prevention program and an escort service.

So far, the proposed revampings lay only in the realm of imagery.
But the vision for the future bears prospects for renovations that are
real, substantial—and very necessary.

We hope some new blood in the department will help bring these
changes to fruition.

Airing the linen

Just when you thought it was safe to stop worrying about faculty
hiring procedures, the six-month old case of Stuart Rothenberg was
brought to renewed attention this week when the former professor
returned as a guest lecturer.

In a renewed attempt to air adequately his views on what he calls
is a discriminatory practice, Rothenberg says he made an agree-
ment that his opinions would be aired as part of a larger look at af-
firmative action and the University’s stand on it. But though Presi-
dent O’Brien said the issue is worth discussion, an initial attempt to
do just that has been scrapped.

While we understand the constraints of the publications staff —
and though our inability to locate the freelance story makes judge-
ment on it impossible — it is nonetheless easy for us to recommend
the project of publicizing the issue in a public forum like Bucknell
World be taken off of ‘“‘hold.”’

A unbiased and thorough reporting of the Rothenberg case and its
implications for the University has been our aim since it surfaced.
We think the University should want, and is obliged, to air its
philosophical linen for all its constituents to see.

LETTERS
Chapel Choir (continued)

To the Editor:

After reading last week Bucknellian and the three letters to the
editor published therein in reference to the Chapel Choir, I feel obliged
to respond in support of Professor Christopher McGahan. If the
writers felt McRae was ‘“‘undeservedly tainted’’ by the article of the
previous week, I-can’t begin to characterize the implied slurs on
McGahan’s abilities inherent in these letters.

In particular, I would like to indicate that Dianne Bouvier ’81 has not
been singing in the choir since McGahan took over its direction and
that Barbara Ann Rudolph ’80 has not been a member of the choir at
any time. As for myself, I have been a member since the beginning of
my freshman year and have experienced both the ‘‘old’” and the
“new” choir. I thus feel my opinion to be a better-informed one. In an
organization as tight-knit as the Chapel Choir, one can only under-
stand its successes and failures if one has worked within the group.

McRae was the founder and spirited director of the choir I joined in
1978, but having sung in several choirs since childhood, I felt the level
of musical professionalism a university choir ought, in my opinion, to
exhibit, was less than realized. McRae gave the choir a great deal in
terms of spirit and love, but this did not compensate musically for the
needed technique.

Upon McRae’s succession by McGahan, the choir immediately
underwent many transformations, particularly in terms of the level of
musicianship required of its members. McGahan introduced techni-
ques, especially eurhythmics, that were new to the group. These were
viewed by many with the suspicion and disdain that I would never
have expected of my fellow singers.

Instead of accepting McGahan’s attempts to improve the musical
level of the choir, several choir members resented any changes in the
McRae traditions and actively resisted his efforts. I saw some of the
most loyal choir members turn against their newly-appointed director
in attempts to get him dismissed from the Department of Music. That
McGahan stood his ground in the face of this resistance to progressive
change took a strength of character for which I applaud him.

When these resistors to change left dissatisfied, the growth of the
“new”? Chapel Choir began. The level of musicianship attained by the
remaining members was a source of great pride for us all, especially
for our director. While the majority of the group graduated in June,
five remain this year to form the backbone of the Choir, which current-
ly numbers 20 and is composed mostly of freshmen.

Since September, our musical growth, both as individuals and more
importantly as an ensemble, has been tremendous. It has come from
the efforts of talented, dedicated individuals, but it is rooted in the
musicianship, energy and determination of Christopher McGahan.

| Andrews’ political spectrum

By PHIL ANDREWS

2500 years ago, Confucius noted that “If names
are not correct, language will not be in accordance
with the truth of things.” As careful as the
Bucknellian has been this year to follow this obser-
vation, last week’s headlines pertaining to the
Bucknell Progressive Caucus (BPC) reflected con-
fusion more than Confucius.

As a non-radical member of the BPC, and as one
who was quoted in the article entitled ‘Meeting of
radicals draws large crowd,’’ I would like to dispel
the notion created by that headline that BPC
members are necessarily radical. My guess (I am
neither an officer of, nor an official spokesperson
for the BPC) is that most BPC members would ob-
ject to being classified as radical.

Because the words radical, liberal, conservative
and progressive are prescriptive as well as descrip-
tive and because there are critical differences be-
tween the terms, I offer the following as an inter-
pretation of what they mean in general and in
United States politics in particular.

My definition of a radical is one who believes that
the roots of society’s problems lie in its dominant
political, economic, and/or social institutions. Thus,
a radical believes that fundamental changes are
needed in the structure of those institutions. A
radical may or may not advocate working within
the existing political system to change it.

In U.S. politics, a radical is considered extreme.
Thus, a common tactic of politicians is to label an
opponent or an idea they don’t like as radical.

My definition of a liberal is one who believes that
society’s dominant institutions are basically sound,
but need to be tinkered with occasionally to better
meet society’s needs. A liberal is receptive to
change and advocates working through the existing
political system to achieve it.

A “mental health problem” is
just what the name implies, a
health problem, one that we may
not completely understand as we
do physical illness, but it is an ill-
ness. A hurt mind needs as much
care as a hurt body, empathy,
although not sympathy. To print
an article detailing the actions of
a person who has been or is under

by printing the article as front
page news. People have pro-
blems, each and every one of us,
some greater than others, and it’s
time we concern ourselves with
how the other person might feel.

In U.S. politics, a liberal is generally considered
to be one who has “great faith in the ability of the
Federal Government to protect and defend its peo-
ple” according to Mary McGovern, daughter of the
defeated Senator. The word protect is taken to in-

clude protection from poverty, exploitation, hunger,
disaster and other undesirable conditions.

My definition of a conservative is one who
believes that society’s institutions are sound, and
that efforts to reform them usually do more harm
than good. A conservative conserves the status quo,
in contrast to a reactionary who reacts against the
status quo and proposals to reform it.

In U.S. politics a conservative is generally con-
sidered to be one who opposes a larger federal
government role in the economy and in social
welfare areas. A larger role for the states and/or for
the private sector is preferred as the best course of
action.

My definition of a progressive is one who believes
that most of society’s institutions are sound, but
that some require fundamental change. The pro-
gressive attempts to preserve those institutions con-
sidered good with the same fervor that he/she tries
to change those institutions considered bad. As long
as political freedom exists and electoral fraud by
the governing authorities does not, a progressive
works within the existing system.

In U.S. politics, my guess is that most pro-
gressives support economic democracy (i.e.,
worker participation in, and/or control of manage-
ment decisions), equal rights for all regardless of
sex or sexual preference, laws that would
strengthen civil liberties and civil rights provisions,
and the development of a conserver ethic toward
the environment.

Additionally, I think most progressives would
strongly support supranational efforts to tackle
global problems. Nationalism and militarism would
generally be viewed as counterproductive to prog-
ress on this front.

Rudyard Kipling once wrote, ‘‘Words are, of
course, the most powerful drug used by mankind.”’
As drugs can heighten or obscure understanding,
and stimulate or depress action, so too can words.
Let us use them with care.

It’s Bison!

To the Editor:

The letter from Lori Mougalian
’84 in your issue of Nov. 7 (‘‘Not
Bison’’) hit a responsive chord.
As some of my friends are well
aware, I have been pleading the
case of Bison, as opposed to
Bisons, for a number of years.

I regret to say that I have met
with very little success. There is,
however, one place on campus
where one can witness the cor-
rect use of the plural noun — in
Memorial Stadium. The helmets
worn by Bucknell football players
say Bison, not Bisons.

President
Michael Suarez *82

Did you ever wonder what the ABS really
does? Could it ever make a difference? I
share the same concerns. I’ve seen Bucknell
student government from nearly every
angle: as vice president of my freshman
class, president of Vedder Dorm Council,
member of the Committee On Student Pro-
grams, ABS Appropriations Committee
member, University Council member and
ABS Congressman for the past two years. I
know what’s wrong with our student govern-
ment and I plan to resolve some of its
longstanding problems.

We need an action-oriented ABS, an ABS
with realistic clearly defined goals, an ABS
with priorities that can be translated into
policy. It is not sufficient for the ABS Con-
gress merely to discuss and propose action;
empty lip service profits no one. It is time
that practical productive programs were
developed. Programs that act on issues such
as women’s safety on campus, alcohol policy
and constructive means of limiting tuition
hikes.

To be a critical watchdog over the ad-
ministration is not enough; all facets of the
University should work together to effect
constructive change. Only then can we call
ourselves a community.

The ABS has a long way to go before it ade-
quately fulfills its potential. It must begin by
earning the respect of its community. We
need a president with the experience,
originality, enthusiasm and — most im-
portantly — leadership to make the ABS a
viable force at Bucknell.

I pledge a high degree of personal commit-
ment to make ABS an effective working
body. I challenge you to do the same.

Bill Thum ’82

Since freshman year, I have experienced a
love-hate relationship with Bucknell. While
given the large amount of talented students
gathered here, their potential has rarely
been realized. Part of the problem involves
the ineffectiveness of the present ABS,
where students are rarely motivated to
critically evaluate the University and press
for change. I would like to be given the op-
portunity to remedy this situation.

One area of change would be within the
ABS itself through a greater exposure to the

campus, a concentration on action and not
talk, and a momentum which stimulates the

students to take the problems they see at
Bucknell and work for reform.

A second area of change would be to unite
the students in a project involving the talents
of both Colleges to solve specific problems
within the greater University community,
emphasizing that responsibility does not end
with studies and socializing but entails an ac-
tive caring for one’s environment and
fellows.

I believe my great amount of experience in
dealing with the trustees, administration,
faculty and students through University
committees, social events such as
Homecoming and fund raising efforts such
as the 1980 Phone-A-Thon have given me a
high level of insight into how things get ac-
complished at Bucknell.

Now, I’d like to take that experience and
use it to fulfill the ABS’s and students’ poten-
tial to the greatest extent. I’d appreciate
your support in my effort.

Vice President ___

In the past two and a half years at
Bucknell I have become quite involved in
several aspects of the University. This in-
volvement has exposed me to diverse opi-
nions and attitudes among the student body,
faculty and administration.

I am asking you at this time to elect me as
vice president of ABS because I feel I have
built a firm base of experience and am ready
to help set the guidelines upon which ABS
will act during the next year.

ABS as a whole has been hard-struck by an
unfortunate trend of apathy among students.
It has served largely as an information
source for current events on campus and as
a place where students could air their views
on specific issues such as the third floor of
the UC, University relations and the budget.

By developing ‘‘action teams’’ on issues to
research and develop proposals, I believe we
can be a much more effective body, and
perhaps gain the recognition we need as an
active — rather than passive — body.

I have proven my interest in becoming an
active member of our student body through
my involvement in Swartz Dorm Council
(serving two years as secretary), ABS Con-
gress and Appropriations Committee, and
the Committee on Instruction, and will use
this experience if elected to the best interest
of all Bucknellians.

William Walz 82

The vice president holds a fiexibie otfice.
Free of the day-to-day chores and duties of
the president, he operates under his own

directive with an almest unlimited op-
portunity to get things done.

I would bring my interest and enthusiasm
to this job-attending to the designated
responsibility of running the elections, but
also initiating some projects I have been
looking forward to, such as stimulating sup-
port for the arts on campus. I know how this
can be done, motivation and interest would
keep me on top of the situation monitoring
the decision-making, seeing that no op-
portunities pass by, and creating new
possibilities for an enriched college ex-
perience.

The vice president has a power base that,
if elected, I intend to exploit to its fullest in
the students’ interest. I would approach the
administration from this base to assure stu-
dent representation. The vice-presidency is
a power base that could well support my
platform of aid to the arts, increased coed
living and more solar mods.

With your support I could assume a
leading role in an ABS Congress, respected
by the administration for its common sense
and students for its active role at Bucknell.

Treasurer
Andy Brody ’82

To successfully fulfill the responsibilities
of ABS treasurer, there is a need for
understanding the Bucknell community and
the people within it. During the last three
years, I have actively participated in the
campus community.

‘As a sophomore, I co-founded the Students
for Environmental Awareness. Through
SEA I had the opportunity to work with the
Committee on Student Programs and the
ABS Appropriations Committee. In the Fall
of 1979, SEA organized the colloquy entitled
“Progress: As If Survival Mattered.” This
afforded me the opportunity to work with the
Concern and Action organization. This
semester I was one of the organizers of the
Bucknell Progressive Caucus, whose pur-
pose is to promote political discussion on
campus.

Thave in the past. had the opportunity and
the motivation to participate in extracur-
ricular activities. As treasurer, I will be able
to give all the time and energy necessary to
fulfill the job. 4

As ABS treasurer, I would have two major
functions to perform. First, to be treasurer
for the students at Bucknell. This entails be-
ing responsible for the orderly distribution of
student activities fees. I will advocate an
open and frank discussion by all students on
the allocation of student funds.

My second responsibility (of equal im-
portance) is to work in conjunction with the
other members of the ABS Steering Commit-
tee. By working in close cooperation with
other student leaders, I hope to effectuate
positive changes in Bucknell policies dealing
with tuition, financing, curriculum and ot-
her issues that affect the Bucknell communi-
ty. I would hope that all students would work
with whomever is elected. To have a
dynami student government, it is necessary
to maximize student input.

Voting Info
Balloting for ABS offices
will be held Tuesday in the
uphill and downhill lobbies
of the University Center.
The polls will be open from
8 a.m. to 6 p.m. Students
must present their Buck-
nell ID in order to vote.

Candidates for ABS make statements

Mark Barbour ’82

Le!

Being treasurer of the ABS isa responsible
position and a responsible person should be
elected. In spite of this I am still running for
the office. I have been a dorm representative
to the ABS Congress for the past two years
and have not been involved in any scandals
or been accused of using my position to gain
unfair advantages over others. I feel I have
obtained a good understanding of how the
ABS operates and what its goals and objec-
tives are.

I could tell you that I was treasurer of my
high school class, currently a 4.0 accounting
major and want to be president of Citibank
when I graduate. But I won't. Besides, it’s
not true

What I will say is that as treasurer I would
make sure the students’ money was spent
and allocated in the best interest of the
students. I am certain I am capable of main-
taining accurate accounts, and would make
sure no money was mishandled or wasted.

It takes 25 minutes to get lunch at the Roy
Grier; it only takes two minutes to vote.

Dan Huck ’84

The next year will be a crucial one in
deciding the power and influence of student
government at Bucknell. The people chosen
for the top ABS positions must be strong
leaders with initiative.

There is a tendency, however, to focus at-
tention on the selection of the ABS president
and to delegate the other three offices
“unimportant.”

The office of treasurer is especially
overlooked and underestimated. Financing
all clubs and organizations on campus in-
volves a large budget and organizational ac-
curacy. I have discussed the responsibilities
that this office includes with the present
Treasurer, Pam Ecock. The time commit-
ment is large and the constant shifting of in-
formation takes a good organizational sense.

I have no misconceptions or lack of in-
formation about the office of treasurer, but I
do want to address one point that might be
influencing some thoughts. I anticipate some
people will look on my holding the office of
freshman class president and ABS treasurer
as ‘too much.”” However, my present consti-
tuents of the freshman class and the people
voting in this election should realize that
these two offices can complement each other
through experience gained and the fresh in-
put that an experienced freshman student
can offer.

Hence, I am in a uniquely appropriate
position for treasurer; I have experience in
ABS government as a member of the Con-
gress, yet I am still new enough at Bucknell

to remain unprejudiced in my decisions
about budgetary allocations.

Without employing a ‘time and energy”
cliche; I want to reiterate that I possess no
naivete about what the office of treasurer in-
volves. All of student government at
Bucknell must be strong and willing to use
this strength to move securely and steadily
toward a position of respect in the Bucknell
community.

Secretary
Lon Castle ’83

As a sophomore, I feel a certain obligation
to the other undergraduates and administra-
tion of the University to become actively in-
volved in the affairs of student government.

This desire to seek office was driven by
two personal opinions. First of all, I sincere-
ly believe our administration has, in several
instances, exhibited its interest in the
welfare of the students and has endeavored
to cater to our needs. Secondly, I also believe
that we, as students, have a right to com-
plain to the administration when we feel as
though we are being dealt with unjustly.

I think the best way to facilitate the resolu-
tion of problems and hasten the development
of programs which will benefit the students
lies in establishing a good relationship bet-
ween the student body and the administra-
tion.

The initial step in establishing this affilia-
tion is to inform the students as to what ideas
are being discussed and invite their own
philosophies on the subject. The second is to
incorporate the notions of a wide section of
the student body into the workings of the
ABS.

As secretary, I would strive to make the
ideas that circulate within the ABS more
widely known to the students of the campus.
By doing this, a more precise picture of what
the students think could be presented to the
administration and — in turn — the ad-
ministration would able to serve the in-
terests of the students more completely.

Student government, both good and bad,
thrives on the diversity of its ideas. The dif-
ference between them, however, depends
upon how wide a segment of the population
these ideas are derived from. If the student
body wishes to make their time at Bucknell
more enjoyable, their first priority should be
to take an active role in the workings of stu-
dent government.

Join the race!

ARTS

University artists give two fine concerts

Dancers’ performance marked

by sparkle, grace & subtle wit

By AMY FORTGANG

The Bucknell Dance Company
— for the five years since its foun-
ding in 1975 — has had to exist
with makeshift theaters in Tustin
Gym and the Field House Dance
Studio, and though the conditions
are much improved this year, the
problem still remains.

In its fall concert Tuesday
night, the troupe took a big step
up in its performance ac-
commodations, but 250 seats in
Larison Dining Hall were not
enough to hold the crowd of about
450 that flocked to see the
dancers. Even the company’s of-
ficers had not anticipated the im-
mense popularity the event would
have and printed only 300 pro-
grams.

Within those programs, shared
by the late-comers, was the
listing of 11 dances that marked
the most successful concert yet of
the company.

Tuesday’s performance
witnessed the latest chapter in
the metamorphosis of the
Bucknell Dance Company — nee
the Bucknell Dance Club, nee Or-

chesis/Ballet Workshop — and
was full of startling revelations.
The dances, with the painfully ob-
vious exception of two very out-
of-place numbers, were more
subtle than ever before and the
dancers themselves were, on the
whole, more skilled than they
previously had been.

The company has evolved into
a group of talented dancers
whose technical training has
been completed enough to allow
them to polish their per-
formances.

Newcomers Cheryl Klinger ’84
and Charlotte Tsuyuke ’84 per-
formed especially well, with
great style and sparkle.

Senior Alison Corvington,
returned from a semester
abroad, also exhibited this piz-
zazz in the two pieces she danced,
as did visiting student Don Mc-
Cormack.

McCormack proved a talented
and diverse performer whose im-
agination and wit — coupled with
an obviously strong ballet/jazz
background — shone in every

number in which he was involv-
ed. The most notable of his three
choreographic achievements was
entitled ‘Ellipsis ...”” Opening
the second half of the show, Mc-
Cormack and four other dancers
— graduate student Dean

Allebach, Melinda Clay ’81, Corv-
ington and Klinger — presented a
piece with a power and depth
which has not been seen in recent
dance productions here.

The company’s concert was by
far the most professional job the

group has done to date and one
would hope when the per-
formance moves to Coleman
Theatre — as it will Feb. 14 — the
dancers will no longer be limited
by either the stage or the seating
capacity.

THEATRE PRESERVE—Assistant Professor of English Jeffry Walker performs
here Sunday. Walker took a year’s leave of absence to present his abstract
theater production at campuses around Pennsylvania. The piece—in the
form of a trilogy—is entitled “Eyes of the Storm” and is intended to point
out what Walker considers to be the problems of “our profit oriented
system.” The message is conveyed through the story of the destruction of
four animals—a bird, an octopus, an ape and a man. Theatre Preserve—
the name of the entire project—is arrived at from the journal Walker is
keeping of his experiences and feelings as he cycles his show from college
to college. Contained within these preserved notes are the recorded
meetings with strangers and the observed reactions to his performance.
When the journal is completed, Walker wants “to integrate reflections on
working: in’the theater with responsibility to mobilize toward social change.”

By DAVID HAWKINGS

The appearance of the Bucknell Univer-
sity Orchestra for a concert of all-German
music in Rooke Chapel Friday night was
eagerly awaited by those who heard the
group’s first performance of the season on
Parents’ Weekend.

Commanding the stage for the entire
two-hour program instead of sharing it
with the University Chorale, the orchestra
made evident their standing as Bucknell’s
most polished and thorough musical
group.

The University Orchestra—directed by
Visiting Assistant Professor of Music
Christopher McGahan with “James
Johnston ’82 as concertmaster—perform-
ed two works by Richard Wagner and one
by Schubert and Beethoven.

The only weak point on the program was
the level of passion in Wagner’s ‘“‘Wesen-
donck Lieder” song cycle. While the or-
chestra itself did a fine job with the subtle
and sometimes sprightly accompaniment
for the soloist, soprano Martha Hill (lec-
turer in Music) was less than convincing in
conveying the piece’s varied moods.
Although her voice was clear and seeming-
ly effortless, she seemed stoic to the point
of fright, and such atmospheres as the
steamy, sensuous one of “Im Treibhaus”
were lost as a result.

The other piece by Wagner, a work for a
smaller orchestra titled “Sigfried Idyll,”
was by contrast the evening’s most
emotive moment. With his reduced group
of- instrumentalists—including a string
quintet—McGahan conceived and brought
forth a wide range of audial emotion and a
high degree of technical proficiency.

The level of competence exhibited by the
smaller group was easily equalled by the
full orchestra in works by Shubert and
Beethoven. In the latter’s ‘Symphony No.
2 in D,” the group presented all the
dynamics of the full symphonic work.
Their precision made it most enjoyable
listening.

Shubert’s ‘Overture in the Italian
Style,” a fairly jubilant piece performed
briskly. and with verve, opened the con-

| cert.- While- ‘some might complain

McGahan ‘padded’ Friday’s program
with a work performed only a month
earlier, the overture was well worth a se-
cond listening.

What was most unfortunate was the
relatively miniscule crowd there to listen.
Pitted against a basketball scrimmage
and a glut of fraternity parties the Univer-
sity Orchestra could not draw more than
double its membership to the concert—a
most undesirable but recurrent problem

here.

For the third program in this
year’s Performing Arts Series,
the University has brought us the
New Globe Theatre, a troupe
whose varied but sporadic talents
arrived on campus Thursday and
will be in Coleman Theatre
tonight and Saturday.

While the Connecticut-based
theatre company has credits in
drama equally as impressive as
those of the Fitzwilliam String
Quartet in music and the Eric
Hawkins Dance Company in
modern dance, the New Globe did
not reach the level of artistic in-
tensity attained by either of the
previous two visiting groups in its
‘opening performance Thursday
night.

In many ways, the troupe’s
staging of Tennessee Williams
Glass Menagerie was enlighten-
ing in its new interpretations of
the 1944 play which has fast
become a classic of the American
stage. Unfortunately, - other
aspects of Producing Director
Stuart Vaughan’s rendition were
bland and occasionally confus-
ing, and the result of this mixture
of very fine moments and very
forgettable ones gave the evening
a pleasant — though uninspired
— taste.

Though it may sound trivial,
the show’s highlight may well be

Stuart Vaughan, director of
the New Globe Theatre,
plays Morell in the group's
production of Shaw's Can-
dida to be shown here at
8:30 p.m. Saturday.

its lighting design. Craig Weind-
ling’s placement of spots gives us
uncannily realistic candles and
lamplight, though miraculously
he never loses the dreamy quality
called forth in the story of un-
fulfilled wishes. Even the
tabletop zoo of glass animals
after which the play is named is
cast in its own special glow.

The contrast in quality was
most clearly evident in the roles

turned in by the two women
whose conflict is perhaps the
heart of Menagerie. As Amanda
Wingfield, Vera Johnson brought
forth a host of subtle emotions
and allusions in an above board
— though hardly exaggerated —
manner. Her movements and
verbal inflections were perfectly
timed; her eloquence gave
Amanda’s plight a poignancy in
itself worthy of a high price of ad-
mission.

As Amanda’s daughter Laura,
however, Carol Stevenson gave
us a performance completely
lacking either eloquence or
subtlety. The New Globe version
of the painfully shy pleurosis vic-
tim is devoid of any true
timidness in all but one scene,
and so the effect of the one scene
in which she gains confidence in
her encounter with her
gentleman caller is lost.

The other two performances
bring the show onto a somewhat
more even keel. John FitzGib-
bon’s Jim O’Connor is a clever,
though a bit unsettling combina-
tion of sincerity and personified
scam; Don Perkins—as the nar-
rating Tom Wingfield— is a little
loud, but inoffensive.

Perkins is the only actor who
will also be on stage Saturday
night, when the New Globe offers
George Bernard Shaw’s Candida.

Hank Ross has instituted a vegetarian plan Mom would love

By AMY KENNEDY

With a trend toward light eating showing up
everywhere in our health and diet-conscious socie-
ty, the University Dining Service has incorporated a
vegetarian entree into its dinner menu for those
students who want such an alternative.

Each vegetarian meal is prepared by six student
cooks. These cooks—Dianne Bouvier ’81, Elizabeth
Sarver ’83, Paul Weiss ’83, Cynthia Gebhard ’83,
Carolynn Stoddard ’83 and Helen Maher ’83- are not
only responsible for preparing the meals, but also
for making up a well-rounded weekly menu.

Recipes are obtained from an assortment of
vegetarian cookbooks supplied by Hank Ross, direc-
tor of the Dining Service.

Bucknell is the only school in the country that
utilizes students in preparing the vegetarian en-
trees, according to Ross.

“Tt is more economical this way,”’ he said, adding
that the vegetarian alternative is an expensive one.

The meals started three years ago when there
were only a couple of seriously interested students,
Ross said. He said he decided to institute a small
program that could “eventually be worked into the
regular meals.” This idea, though, did not work
because the cooks could never judge how much food
to make. Sometimes when the meal looked appetiz-
ing it would all be eaten while at other times there
would be a large portion left over, according to
Ross.

sign up and 50 diners opted for the new plan. Ross
said the next year began what has been a steadily
increasing trend when more than 200 students
signed up, and at present there are 350 diners eating
the vegetarian meals. Of these, one half are really
vegetarians and the remaining half eat the
vegetarian meal ‘‘just for a change,”’ according to
the director.

Ross said that ‘“‘any opportunity a student has for
change is good. Too many Americans overeat,” he
said, ‘‘and we are the largest consumers of meat in
the world anyway.”

Ross said people should realize that ‘‘meat is not
the best thing for you” and there are alternative
sources of protein. He said the main objective of the
vegetarian meal plan is to make students more
aware of the food they eat and next semester a list
of daily minimum requirements filled by each of the
meals as well as the amount of calories they contain
will be posted in the cafeteria.

Ross plans to work on improving the vegetarian
program during January to increase the efficiency
of meal production and preparation. His major goal
for the upcoming period of renovation is the ability
to offer the vegetarian meal as a regular entree.
Now any students eating the vegetarian meal must
sign up and have their meal tickets stamped to
qualify them for the dinner. Ross wants to do away
with this necessity by making the ‘‘veg” meal sim-
ply another menu item.

The Association for the Arts at
Bucknell is a campus organiza-
tion that has yet to be clearly.
defined for the students, ac-
cording to Associate Professor of
English Ralph Rees. Although
many assume it is responsible for
all arts programs occurring
throughout the year, this is not
the case.

All students, whether they
know it or not, are considered
members of the association, ac-
cording to Rees, who serves as
secretary of the organization and
chairman of its Program Com-
mittee.

The group was founded five
years ago, Rees said, as an alum-
ni sponsored and directed
organization designed primarily
to inspire the construction of a
finer auditorium on campus. The
largest auditorium here seats on-
ly 400, and the association’s ideal
goal is the eventual construction
of one that will triple that au-
dience capacity.

The major program of the
group — designed to stimulate a
greater appreciation of the arts
among Bucknellians — is
Celebration of the Arts. During
this week - long festival, student
and professional artists appear
here in a variety of free lectures,
performances and coffeehouses.

It is hoped that these programs
will increase the community’s

awareness of the arts, Rees said,
and will eventually elicit enough
enthusiasm to warrant the
building of a center on campus
dedicated to the arts.

Celebration ’81 will be held
March 8-15. In previous years the
Association has brought such
celebrities as playwright Edward
Albee, actress Cicely Tyson and
dancer Edward Villella to the
University for the celebration.
This year it has booked pro-
ducer/director/actor John
Houseman, who played the stern
Professor Kingsfield in the movie
“The Paper Chase,” for the
keynote lecture.

The contest was an opportunity
for Russell to use his bench, and
he substituted freely. Senior
Chris Layton, junior Jeff Payne,
sophomores Mike Hoffman and
Jon Simone and freshman Scott
Mutschler all made contributions
in the game and throughout the
tournament.

Schulte, Gensheimer and Pax-
ton all received first team All-
East honors for their play over
the weekend and Butler was
Named iv the second ivam.
Schulte scored on 19 of 33 shots
and added seven assists as he
upped his season totals to 172

goais and 83 assists. Gensheimer
broke the 100 goal plateau with
106 by recording 13 goals and 23
assists. Paxton recorded 39 saves
in the three games including 19
against Fordham to tie his school
record. Butler tallied nine goals
and his 19 assists increased his
school record single season
assists total to 126.

After the closing ceremonies,
highlighted when Russell was
given the customary dunking in
the pool, the Bisons turned their
attention to the NCAA Champion-
ship. Paxton commented, ‘‘Our
first goal will be to beat a Califor-
nia team and (thereby) finish in
the top four.’’

The Bisons were edged 8-6 by
UCLA, the only collegiate team
from California they have faced
this year, in the Brown Tourna-
ment Sept. 27 in Providence. The
result enabled Bucknell to finish
second behind UCLA and showed
significant improvement over
last year’s 17-7 loss to UCLA in
the NCAA Championships.

In preparation, Russell noted,
“‘We’ll really have to work on our
set plays because (the
perennially-dominating Califor-
nia teams) won’t be giving us
Many counter attacks.” The
Bisons’ strong point is their high-
scoring counter attack.

only 34 percent from the field in the half, compared
to 63 percent for Portugal.

Nevertheless, the much-taller Bisons stayed
within striking distance throughout the final 20
minutes, never falling behind by more than five
points, and scored eight of the final 10 points to earn
the tie.

The Bisons, having lost four of last year’s five
starters, showed a “‘lack of experience’’ and a need
to ‘‘develop new chemistry” according to Woollum.
The coach, however, will be patient, stating ‘‘It will
take into the season to get these things done.”

Bucknell committed 18 turnovers and 37 personal
fouls, leading Woollum to remark, “‘Most of our
mistakes were aggressive mistakes; from a lack of
experience. They weren’t from lack of effort.”
Leslie said, ‘‘We need to think a little more before
we act.”

Explaining the cagers’ 40 percent shooting from
the field for the contest, Leslie said, ““We weren’t as

Ever since 1952 when the movie “Where

the college vacation capitol, this beach
resort has been growing in popularity.

One can only guess why thousands upon
thousands of collegians escape to Ft.
Lauderdale every spring recess.

. .. Maybe it's the close proximity of the
beaches to the clubs (approx. 15 yds. and
18 yrs. of age minimum), OR

tators every afternoon, OR

patient as we should have been.” Leslie, the team
captain, noted, ‘‘Coach is putting pressure on me to
make everyone patient.”

According to Leslie, the combination of the pre-
game fanfare and ‘not being as physically
prepared as we should have been”’ caused the Bison
players to tire easily and caused some of the poor
play. Because it was the first game of the season,
Woollum commented, ‘The emotional buildup
burned a great deal of our energy.’’ He added, ‘“‘We
have a lot of work to do. We need to build on
strength.”’

Although students were charged $1 for admission
and area residents paid a $2 fee, the exhibition con-
test “probably finished in the red’’ according to
Director of Athletics Bruce Corrie. Corrie explain-
ed, ‘It would have been necessary for us to charge
$2 and $3’’ to cover the $1,200 guaranteed the Por-
tuguese Basketball Federation in addition to the
hotel and meal expenses incurred by the delegation.
Exact figures of the official attendance and the net
financial loss are not yet available, Corrie said.

Dave Inglefield
as the Bisons tune up for their

nell has finished seventh, sixth and fifth

By BOB DAVIS

Following his team’s im-
pressive third place finish in the
NCAA District II cross country
championships last Saturday at
Lehigh University, coach Art
Gulden commented, ‘“‘We ran
fast, but we’re capable of better
— it wasn’t our best race.”

The Bisons’ best-ever finish in
the district race earned them a
trip to the NCAA Championship
finals Monday in Wichita, Kan-
sas. The harriers finished 17th in
the NCAA Championships in each
of the last two seasons.

In Saturday’s meet, defending
champion Penn State topped the
33-team field for the second year
in a row with 37 points followed
by Villanova with 71 and Bucknell
with 94. The Bisons upset
Villanova to win the IC4A Cham-
pionship Oct. 20in New York.

Solomon Chebor of Fairleigh
Dickinson finished first over the
10,000 meter course with a time of
29:19.3. Alan Scharsu and Larry
Mangan, both of Penn State,
crossed the line second and third
in 29:21 and 29:37, respectively.

Freshman sensation Bill
Reifsnyder was the top Bucknell
runner, placing seventh with a
time of 29:54.8, the fastest 10,000
run in school history. Tri-captain
Rick Sayre ’82 was the next Bison
to cross the line, finishing 12th in
30:08. According to Gulden it was
the best performance of the year
by Sayre, who has been frus-
trated by health problems all
season.

Rounding out the field for the
harriers were junior Steve Bigot-
to (20th in 30:33), sophomore
Mark Hulme (27th in 30:43),
senior tri-captains Jim O’Shea
(28th in 30:45) and Mike Debrag-
gio (36th in 30:51) and freshman
Jeff Hines (53rd in 31:08).

Gulden said, “The kids:decided
that they wanted to run with Penn
State, and they tried, but they
(Penn State) were just too good,”
adding ‘The aggressiveness we
showed was good, but we
should’ve run more under con-
trol.’ He noted, ‘‘We ran the first
mile too fast..It set up the quick.

times, but caused us to fade a lit-
tle.”

The third-place finish does not
affect the harriers’ dual meet
winning streak, which stands at
73.

Gulden has altered his prac-
tices very little in preparation for
the NCAA Championships in
simply cutting back from 100 to 80
miles a week and introducing
one-quarter-mile sprints into the
workouts.

Gulden stated, ‘Being rested
and sharp is important,” and
added, “We've worked harder
than anyone in the conference,
but you can’t do much condition-
ing at this point.”

Commenting on his team’s
mental attitude, Gulden said,
“They're not frightened; we've
been there before.’ The coach
continued, ‘“‘They’ve gained con-
fidence with each race — they
know they have the ability.”

Speculating on the Bisons’
chances in the 10,000 meter
NCAA race involving 29 teams,
Gulden said, ‘‘If we run like we
did in the IC4A’s we could finish

Texas El Paso, according to
Gulden, ‘‘will win unless the team
gets hit by a truck.” Their squad
features seven Africans, in-
cluding Sulyman Nyambuia, a 30-
year-old teacher from Tanzania
who finished second at 5,000
meters in the summer Olympics.
Gulden lamented, ‘‘He’s their
third man — they’ve got two guys
better than him.”

According to Gulden, three of
the remaining four top teams are
predominantly foreign, including
Western Kentucky, East Ten-
nessee State and Arkansas. He
feels Penn State is the best “‘all-
American” team.

Gulden concluded, “‘It’s been a
super year and very rewarding.
We've done more than we had an-
ticipated.” The harriers defeated
all nine of their dual and tri-meet
opponents on their way to win-
ning their sixth consecutive ECC
championship Nov. 8 in Philadel-

Polo is class of East;
tops Loyola for title

By DAVE KIRKPATRICK

NEW YORK—Coach Dick Russell described it
played and very well executed.’ Dominating and awesome also ac-
curately describe the water polo team’s performance at the Eastern
Championships last weekend at Fordham University. The Bisons top-
pled in succession Washington and Lee, 28-2, Fordham, 17-6, and
Loyola of Chicago, 12-9, to gain the title of ‘Eastern Champions’ for the
fourth straight year.

The win virtually assured the squad a fourth straight trip to the
NCAA Championship to be contested Nov. 28-29 in Long Beach,
decide the eight teams to be invited to Long
Beach at the conclusion of the California championships being held
this weekend.

In the championship game against Loyola, the Bisons took an early
2-0 lead on goals by seniors Scott Schulte and Mark Gensheimer. In-
by the vaunted Bisons, the predominantly
freshman and sophomore stocked Loyola team rallied behind the
strong goal-tending of Chuck Haak, and was able to hold the deficit to
only 6-5 at halftime.

In the second half, the experienced Bison squad began asserting
itself in subtle ways, forcing Loyola further from Bison netminder
Tony Paxton ’81. Loyola’s frustration grew and soon the Bisons were
able to spring their forwards on two on one breaks.

Unfortunately, the Bisons were consistently thwarted by the
outstanding play of Haak, and couldn’t put the game away. Eventual-
ly, though, the Bucknell squad became difficult to contain while
preventing Loyla from closing the gap. When time expired, the Bisons
had virtually secured a return trip to the NCAA’s with a 12-9 triumph.

Afterward Russell commented, ‘“‘We have an experienced squad
that knows how to win,” and added, ‘“‘this is the first year we’ve come
here as the odds-on favorite, and I think the players handled it well.”

The Bisons reached the finals by exploding for nine goals in the
fourth quarter of their semifinal match with host Fordham to turn an
8-5 advantage into a 17-6 win.

Fordham is one of Bucknell’s traditional water polo rivals, and even
though the Bisons had defeated the Rams twice already this year, they
knew Fordham would pose another challenge.

Prior to the game, Pete Weiman ’81 commented, ‘The key to this
game will be how well they switch off on our hole man (Tom Butler
*g).”” And for three periods the Rams did a very effective job enacting
their strategy.

Trailing by only three entering the fourth quarter, Fordham sudden-
ly came alive when spurred on by their boisterous fans. Time and
again Fordham assaulted the Bison net, yet Paxton was equal to each
task with arm and legs flailing mightily to reject every charge.

At the other end of the pool, the Bisons were driving hard and their
lead started to build. First Schulte, the University’s career scoring
leader with 574 goals, tallied followed by Gensheimer, Butler, Mrac
Corl ’81 and Weiman. Soon the Bisons were scoring almost as fast as
the Rams could put the ball in play following a Bucknell score. The
final 17-6 verdict was reflective of the Bisons’ domination.

Saturday morning’s opening game against Washington and Lee
proved virtually a shooting gallery for the Bisons. Schulte scored just
17 seconds into the game and wound up connecting on nine of 10 shots
for the contest and Butler dished out eight assists as Bucknell rolled to
a 28-2 demolition of their outclassed opponents.

The Bison locker room after last Satur-
day’s game was the scene of a wild
celebration. The gridders had just ended
their season with a stunning 30-17
thrashing of Boston University, who came
into the game as the ECAC Division I-AA’s
fourth ranked team with an 8-1 record.

Head Coach Bob Curtis, standing on a
bench, told his players, ‘I’m more proud
of this team than any team I’ve coached in
the past. 1 am as proud as can be.”

The upset victory, achieved by an in-
spired second half effort, gave the Bisons
(6-4) their first winning season since 1975’s
5-4 ledger.

The Herd faced a difficult challenge in
trying to defeat the high-scoring Terriers
but found themselves in a 3-3 deadlock at
halftime. The Bisons’ points came on a 40-
yard field goal from Alvin Depew ’81.

Curtis, commenting on the unyielding
Bucknell defense in the first half, said,
“The Bison defense plays by the ‘Bend but
don’t break’ theory. They know the other
guy will only get so far before they stop
him.”

Poor execution by Bucknell gave Boston
University a 10-3 edge early in the second
half. Defensive tackle Bill Goldsmith
pounced on a loose ball in the endzone after
quarterback Al Locey ’83 tossed a pitchout
over the head of fullback Marshall Hall ’83
deep in Bison territory.

When safety Jim Gush ’81 picked off a
Jim Jensen aerial and returned it 44 yards
to the Terrier 25-yard line two series later,
the Herd had the break they needed to get
their offense untracked.

Wide receiver Dave Kucera ’84 ran 10
yards to the one-yard line on a reverse
around right end to set up a Hall
touchdown blast to even the contest at 10-
10.

Fullback Marshall Hall ‘83 plunges over Boston University defenders for the first Bison touchdown Saturday

The offense was called back into action
almost immediately when linebacker Ken
Durr ’82 intercepted another Jensen pass
and returned it 12 yards to the Terrier 18.
Halfback Ken Jenkins ’82 accounted for 11
of the remaining yards on a weak side
sweep and three plays later Locey hit
paydirt on a quarterback sneak from the
one. Depew’s conversion was successful
and the Bisons were ahead for good at 17-
10.

Faced with a third-and-15 from their own
26-yard line on their next possession, Cur-
tis called for the ‘134 counter special,’ a
trap play to Jenkins. Jenkins followed a

block from right tackle Mike McDonald ’80
up the middle, then cut to the open right
sideline and brought the crowd to its feet
with a 74-yard scoring burst. The Herd’s
margin showed 23-10 when Depew’s con-
version failed.

The touchdown was Jenkins’ 15th of the
season, breaking the University single
season record.

A 40-yard Jensen to Scott Phinney com-
pletion set up a one-yard plunge by Gregg
Drew to close the gap to 23-17 with over
five minutes remaining. However, Jenkins
put the final touch on another stellar in-

dividual performance by charging 18
yards for a score with but 51 seconds left to
bring the final tally to 30-17.

Jenkins, who rushed 26 times for 191
yards, established Bucknell single season
records for carries (213), rushing yards
(1,270) and touchdowns (16). Jenkins also
broke the NCAA Division I-AA record for
all-purpose yards with 1,884, eclipsing by
78 yards the mark of Nevada-Reno’s
Frank Hawkins set last season.

ABS, faculty divide

on tuition rise plans

Suarez wins
ABS vote
after dispute

By SUE COSTELLO
and LYDIA HIGGINSON

Michael Suarez ’82 was elected
president of the Association of
Bucknell Students Thursday in an
unprecedented special election
following the disclosure of campaign
rules violations by both Suarez and
his opponent, Bill Thum 82.

Suarez won the second election for
the post with 60 percent of the vote to
Thum’s 40, or 538 votes to 353. He
had also won more votes in the first
election for president in the regular
election for ABS steering committee
posts Nov. 24, at that time winning
451 votes to 379 for his opponent—a
percentage margin of 54 to 46.

The present ABS steering commit-
tee nullified the Nov. 24 race for
president at a special meeting Tues-
day night after more than a dozen
written and oral complaints of cam-
paign rules violations were reported
by students. These violations con-
sisted mainly of ‘‘wallpapering” 82
by 11 inch campaign sheets on the
bulletin boards of various residence
halls on campus, according to outgo-
ing ABS President J ohn Dzurinko
81.

Other violations included cam-
paigning after the end of the official
electioneering period and

Vice President for Administration and
Finance John Zeller speaks Monday in
the University Center Forum about the
proposed $1,000 tuition and fees hike.

Professors petition board
for 15 percent wage hike

By DAVID HAWKINGS

Two hours before the ABS Congress called on
the University trustees to raise tuition and fees by
less than $1000 next year, the faculty also voted
unanimously Monday in favor of asalary increase
that would force a tuition hike to near $1115.

Calling for a wage hike that would “address last
year’s inequities,”’ the faculty members, at their
last meeting of the semester, endorsed a motion to
ask the Board of Trustees for an across-the-board
increase of 12 percent and an additional 3 percent
based on merit.

The total of a potential 15 percent in increased
salary—if approved by the board—would give the
faculty an average increase of 11% percent for the
two-year period ending in June 1982. The average
increase in salaries for faculty members at
Bucknell’s 17 ‘frame of reference schools’ will be
between 11 and 12 percent, Vice President for Ad-
ministration and Finance John Zeller said at the
meeting.

‘Insider’s Guide’ is harshly
critical of student life here

By KEN. QUAAS

“Go to school, drink lots of beer and get a job.
That’s Bucknell,” according to a review of the
University by the Insiders Guide to Colleges
1981-82.

The book offers critiques of 252 colleges and
universities in the United States and Canada and
calls Bucknell students “smart, but not par-
ticularly interesting or dynamic” and concludes
“Indeed, beer before food. Bucknell.”

Delivered to bookstores around the country
two weeks ago, the guide was compiled by staff
members of the Yale Daily News and edited by
Jane Allen and Dorian Klein, both 1980 graduates
of Yale University.

Advertised as being ‘Written by students for
students—what college is really like” the Guide
provides a list of student contributors in the
preface—a group that includes but one from
Bucknell—Alan Levine ’80.

Levine said he “wrote the article on
Bucknell.” He said he was in the Bucknellian of-
fice sometime toward the end of fall semester
1979—when he was a news editor—and received
a phone call from “someone” from the Daily
News. Levine said the other party asked for in-
formation about Bucknell and that he wrote ‘“‘two
pages of remarks’ and sent it to New Haven.

When read a transcript of the review, Levine
said ‘“‘I wish I’d kept a copy of what I wrote.
That’s me except for a few lines that were chang-
ed around.” Levine said the review was “‘ac-
curate” and something he “would not be afraid
to put my name on. There’s nothing that can be

she pee,
Congress call for
a reduced budget

By SUSAN MACDONALD
and MATT KARANIAN

Rejecting the University’s cur-
rent proposals for budget
guidelines as too high and the
faculty’s call for a 15 percent
wage and salary hike as too
much, the ABS Congress voted
unanimously Monday to ask the
University Board of Trustees for
a lower tuition and fees increase
than those now anticipated.

Vice President for Administra-
tion and Finance John Zeller —
appearing as a guest of the con-
gress in its last session of the
semester — explained the
University’s current plan for a
rise of between $1000 and $1115,
calling such large tuition in-
creases ‘‘shocking.””

He nevertheless said that rises
of such magnitude were
necessary and inevitable. The
school’s budget of $27 million will
have to increase by $2.7 million to
account for an inflation rate ex-
pected to be about 10 percent,
Zeller said.

“The only real source of big
dollars to make up that incre-
ment is through tuition,” he said.

The vice president came to the
meeting to present both the 10th
and 11th set of budget guidelines,
explaining that the first nine have
all been rejected for various
reasons. The 10th calls for a 9%
percent across-the-board wage
and salary raise for faculty anda
$1000 tuition rise as a result.

The 1ith plan—a version un-
balanced by slightly more than
$93,000 that the faculty gave its
support to in their meeting Mon-
day—would give professors and
staff a 12% percent raise and
would require a tuition and fees
total of $1115.

Both proposals allow for a 3

Recycling dispute acted upon

LS 2 eee ee
Committee recommends return of funds to group

By DAVID 0’CONNELL questing that Coder and Doms agree to Doms said a new problem has surfaced

The University Committee on Com-
plementary Activities is preparing a set of
recommendations designed to resolve the
controversy about the control of $4,633 in
Recycling Group funds presently locked in
a bank account by Professor of
Mechanical Engineering Charles Coder,
the club’s former advisor.

The club petitioned the ABS Oct. 13 to
have the committee examine the problem.
According to Bob Doms ’81, president of
the Recycling Group, the funds should be
used for expansion of the club’s program.

Coder has maintained that the original
intent of the group was to set the funds
aside for a scholarship fund for local high
school students.

‘After a review conducted at meetings of
the committee Nov. 6 and Nov. 20, three
proposals were tentatively agreed upon at
a meeting Tuesday. They will be presented
to the President’s staff for consideration,
according to Bill Thum ’82, chairman of
the committee.

First, the committee plans to recom-
mend that, in general, funds belong to the
organization, and are not under the control
of the advisor, who should act in a
“mechanical” role to oversee fund usage,
Thum said.

Second, he said the committee is re-

ANOTHER LIGHT AT SUNDOWN — Monica

By MATT KARANIAN

David Castilow, assistant director of security at the
University of Nebraska, said Wednesday he refused the
University’s offer to make him Director of Security and
Safety here for contractual and philosophical reasons.

The University asked Castilow to fill the newly-
created post of Director starting Jan. 1, and to begin a
revamping of campus security, making it ‘more profes-
sional,” according to Vice President for Administration

and Finance John Zeller.

Zeller said Nov. 17 he had “every reason to think”
Castilow would accept the University’s job offer. Castilow
apparently misinterpreted the University’s offer, Zeller
said Monday. Castilow “made demands we probably can’t

meet,” he added.

There were ‘“‘contractually a couple of things I wasn’t

have the funds placed in a student account
fund rather than in the present savings ac-
count — which is outside the normal
University auditing system.

Thum said also that the committee will
ask that theRecycling Group be advised to
use the funds for a scholarship if possible.
“Jt’s important to realize that any such
recommendation would not be binding,”
Thum said.

“Qur recommendations resulted from
the fact that there was never a formal
binding agreement made on what the
funds should be used for, based on the
evidence presented,” Thum said. He said
that in the Nov. 20 meeting the committee
was advised by Vice President for Ad-
ministration and Finance John Zeller that
there are no legal principles involved.

Zeller said at the meeting that ‘‘if a club
acts against the advisor’s wishes, then the
advisor can resign,” and that “‘the continu-
ing membership should decide upon finan-
cial goals of a club unless a trust fund for a
specific purpose is set up.”

The committee formulated the recom-
mendations Tuesday, but — because there
was not a quorum present, Thum said —
the proposal will be mailed to committee
members for official action in the near
future.

Castilow ‘‘made it clear he wasn’t interested in our of-

he said.

“We're not sure what we’ll do,” Zeller said. Plans to
have a new Director on the job by January have now been
shattered, and the earliest the post can now be expected to
be filled will be March, according to Zeller. =<

regarding how the funds should be spent.
“For the last two years that Professor
Coder was our advisor, he handled our
finances, and it seems that he was very
neglectful in failing to pay at least $1,500 in
unpaid bills.”

Doms said he was “rudely surprised”
when he learned of the unpaid bills earlier
this semester from University Controller
Ellis Harley, but that Coder’s failure to
pay was probably due to his gradually
decreasing involvement with the club.

Harley confirmed the outstanding
liabilities — which he said currently
amount to $1506 — but he noted that since
the assets in the bank account and the
liabilities were both within the Universi-
ty’s accounting system, no real problem
existed.

Doms said the group should have fuil
control over the money remaining after
the debt is paid. ‘We don’t have anything
against Coder personally — he did a lot to
get the group started,” he said. “It’s just
that we feel that a past advisor shouldn’t
dictate what we should do.”

When reached for comment Wednesday,
Coder said he had not heard anything
regarding the committee’s investigation
into the matter. He said he still maintains
that the funds be used for scholarship pur-
poses, but added that if Zeller told him to,

BOB DOMS
he would ‘“‘of course” release the funds.

Coder had no further comment on the
matter, including the unpaid bills, and in-
sisted that he had not been informed about
the investigation except for one written re-
quest from Thum for pertinent documents
which he ‘‘hasn’t had time te honor.”

Thum said he has ‘“‘repeatedly tried to
keep Coder informed” through campus
mail and office visits, but has been unsuc-
cessful in contacting him.

Doms said that “just because the com-
mittee has recommended that Coder
release control of the funds doesn’t mean
we're out of the woods. If he refuses to
cooperate, it could be a messy situation.”

Board of Trustees meets
for “routine” sessions

By DAVID HAWKINGS
The University Board of Trustees gathered in New York City this morning for

a two-day meeting that Vice President for Administration and Finance John
Zeller has called ‘“‘typically routine.”

Zeller, who serves as one of the board’s secretaries, said this week that no
non-routine actions are expected to be taken by the 36-member group, which
will be holding committee meetings through this afternoon and have a general
board meeting at the Warwick Hotel Saturday morning.

The executive committee of the board — which makes many of the important
financial and academic policy decisions for the trustees — is not scheduled to

meet.

The four standing committees convening today include the Complementary
University Activities, which will discuss the new social guidelines set forth by
the administration this fall; and the University Relations Committee,- which
will discuss current fund raising efforts and public relations.

The Committee on Educational Policy, in addition to approving staff appoint-
ments and sabbatical leaves, will discuss a proposed merit salary increase plan
now under discussion by the faculty. The Finance Committee will discuss the
current budget and tuition guidelines, but will make no recommendations or
decisions until after the next meeting of the executive committee, in January or

February. (See story, page 1.)

The Finance Committee may also discuss the ABS Congress proposal for
completion of the vacant third floor of the University Center.
Two student and two faculty elected representatives will attend each commit-

tee meeting as non-voting members. Two students and faculty will also attend
the board’s Saturday meeting primarily as observers.

At the gathering of the full board, the trustees will discuss the $30-50 million
capital campaign for the 1980s, the progress of the computer center now under
construction and the annual audit. ‘Admissions Director Richard Skelton will

also give a presentation on admissions entitled “Marketing Bucknell in the

80s.””

Area water shortage

By LYNNE RUTHERFORD

The current water shortage ex-
isting throughout eastern and
central Pennsylvania has so far
had no effect upon the campus
water supply, according to John
Bell, director of the Physical
Plant.

“We have no plans to call a
water emergency,” Bell said.

Keystone Water Company of
Milton, which who controls the
University’s water supply, is not
taking any action to regulate
water supply: other than calling
for increased conservation. The
company said the recent snow
has helped and they view the
situation as stable, according to
Bell.

Learning to organize and manage an organization
is ‘“‘an absolutely fundamental requirement of a
liberal education,” according to John Miller, head
and professor of management.

This is one of the primary goals of Miller’s In-
troduction to Organization and Management
course. A substantial part of the course work in-
cludes a group project which “must reflect (the
classes’) commitment to respond to a clear need in
the community,” according to Miller.

In addition to providing students with a sense of
how an organization runs, Miller said he has two
other goals for the students in Management 101.
First, he wants the students to learn what managers
do and who they are. “The students should learn
how the key institutions of our society operate,”
Miller added.

The final objective is for the students to begin to
appreciate the theoretical and research problems
that belong in the discipline of organization and
management, Miller said.

According to Miller, the theoretical approach to
management is “‘too distant from anything that’s
real,” when taught by itself.

Several groups continued their projects after the
course ended. ‘‘The finals week survival kit group
went into business for themselves,”’ he said.

This semester there were five projects conducted
by Management 101 students: Casa La Italiano,
Carni Days, ‘The Bike Race,” A.M. Eatables, and
The Bucknell Safety Bureau.

Approximately 250 students take the course each
semester. The class is separated into five recitation
sections and each of the sections is required to com-
plete a class project.

The Italian dinner project—Casa La
Italiano—held in Larison Hall November 9, raised
$230 for the Sunflower Day Care Center in
Lewisburg, according to group president Mark
Everett ’81.

Another group distributed over 800 carnations to

rooms around campus on Carni Day, November 15.
The flowers had been ordered during a sales cam-
paign the previous two weeks. According to dinner
committee chairman Rob Tyrrell ’84, part of the
proceeds will be used to fund a dinner, hosted by the
Carni Day group, for children from the Laurelton
State Center. The remaining funds will be donated
to the center, Tyrrell said.

“The Bike Race’ was also held November 15.
Chris Hlavaty ’84, secretary of the Bike Race group,
said 13 teams paid a $10 entry fee. According to the
class personnel administration manager, Dawn
Sanderson ’82, the group raised $125 which will be
divided evenly between the United Methodist Home
in Lewisburg and the Sunflower Day Care Center.

A.M. Eatables was held November 17, 19 and 21
from 7 to 9 a.m. in Coleman Hall, Olin Science and
Dana Engineering buildings. Group president Chris
Kueffner ’83, said the group sold coffee and donuts
to faculty and students who did not have time for
breakfast before class. Kueffner said the proceeds
from the project will be given to a fund to support
future Management 101 projects.

The Bucknell Safety Bureau conducted a bicycle,
traffic and sports safety clinic in Davis Gym,
November 22, for third,fourth, and fifth grade
students from Lewisburg schools. According to
Steve Vuolo' ’84, director of operations for the
bureau, this is a direct service and funding has been
provided by local merchants.

Miller said he began teaching a similar course on
the graduate level fifteen years ago at the Universi-
ty of Rochester. He said he refined the course while
teaching undergraduates at Yale University and

“The recent rains and snows
have helped a bit, but conserva-
tion measures are always a good
thing,” Robert Naugle, assistant
director of the Physical Plant,
said.

Gov. Richard Thornburgh pro-
claimed on Nov. 19 that a severe

eastern portions of the state. The
Union County Department of
Emergency Services, in response
to the governor’s address, urged
voluntary conservation in an ef-
fort to avert rationing.

Unlike Union County, several
dozen area communities have
begun mandatory water ration-
ing regulations. The counties
have established daily water
allocations of 30 to 40 gallons per
person per day. These counties
include Montour, Northumber-
land, Snyder and Union.

In compliance with the Union
County guidelines, students are
urged to take showers rather
than baths and to limit their
showering time to three minutes.
They should also refrain from

allowing water to run while shav-
ing or while brushing their teeth.

Although the situation remains
stable water company officials
expressed concern that a slow
deterioration of the water supply
will cause more suppliers to
make rationing mandatory.

“Unless we get a substantial
rainfall, the situation is going to
continue to be more and more
severe,’ according to Larry
Welfer, supervisor of the State
Department Of Environmental
Resources.

Colloquies are
discontinued.

“Retreat” alternative

By SUSAN MACDONALD
Saying that ‘the times are
against it,” Director of Student
Activities James Hammerlee an-
nounced Nov. 4 that ‘Colloquy as
we know it isno more.”

A decision was made that day
by the Executive Committee of
Concern and Action — the
University’s principal student
service organization — to review
the content of the semi-annual
weekends the group has orga-
nized for the last 13 years.

JAMES HAMMERLEE

“The response from students
was not good enough for the
amount of effort and money that
had been spent recently,” CA
President Steve Kushner 82 said.
Hammerlee also said lack of stu-
dent interest and attendance at
colloquy events recently was the
principal reason for revamping
the program.

According to Hammerlee,
“although a single public lecture
might have as many as 400 to 600
student attendants, there was on-
ly a core of between 50 and 100
students who closely followed the
program.”

The ‘‘new shape’”’ for colloquy
has no formal title as yet,
although the term “retreat” was
suggested by Kushner. Instead of
a weekend entirely devoted to one
topic, the retreats would be one-
day commitments held at the
conference center in Cowan.

discussed

phasis of the retreats is ‘“‘Per-
sonal Development,” something
Kushner said was not stressed
enough here. “It would include
things like social interaction,
dating, the family, careers, how
to handle criticism, and com-
munication,” he said.

The retreats are still in the ear-
ly planning stages, although
Kushner said the first would pro-
bably be held Feb. 20 and 21.
Hammerlee described the
retreats as ‘‘24 hour experiences
with speakers or someone with
something to share.”

Since the conference center can
accommodate up to 70 people, the
retreats would be geared to a
smaller number of people than
the colloquies were. Hammerlee
said that the format would pro-
bably include registration in ad-
vance with a small charge for the
food.

“Total cost of the retreats
could range anywhere from $10 to
$400,” said Hammerlee, as op-
posed to ‘‘the average fall collo-
quy of about $4000 and the spring
colloquy at $2500.”” The difference
in costs would allow CA to spon-
sor more retreats covering a
wide range of topics.

“We are still puzzled as to why
more people didn’t come to collo-
quy,” Kushner said. ‘The claim
was made that the topics didn’t
interest enough people, and were
too specific, but we opened the
ideas up to the public, and usually
ended up with four to five to
choose from.’”

Kushner said the topics, like
energy, politics and health care
— subjects of three of the most
recent programs — “were or
should be important to every-
one.” Hammerlee said “We tried
to pick a timely subject with in-
teresting films and discussions.”

“We have tried to prove, over
the years, that education is im-
portant outside the classroom
and on the weekends,” Ham-
merlee said.

In addition, Kushner said that
other groups, like the Bucknell
Student Lectureship Committee,
were providing the same service.

Faculty sends reform question
to committee, halting debate

By DAVID HAWKINGS

A sharply divided faculty of the College of Arts
and Sciences voted Nov. 24 to refer the current
plan for general education reform to a newly
created committee, officially ending discussion of
the plan until next fall.

Three vote counts were needed to determine the
outcome of a motion to create a Special Commit-
tee on General Education, which will review the
various other plans for curriculuar reform as well
as the plan by the curriculum committee of the
college that had been discussed at four previous
meetings this fall.

The referral motion, by Associate Professor and
Chairman of Political Science John Peeler,
originally failed by 28 to 27, but two subsequent re-
counts produced passing margins of 28 to 26 and 29
to 26.

An attempt to amend the Peeler motion so that
the new committee would not have until next
September to report back to the Arts and Sciences
faculty — proposed by Professor and Chairman of
Physics Richard Henry — failed by a two-vote
margin near the end of the heated 80-minute
debate, but a general consensus for an interim
and informal report by the committee early next
semester appeared to have emerged from the
debate.

“We really aren’t going to be putting off this
thing for very long,” said Dean of the College of
Arts and Sciences Robert Chambers after the
meeting. As mandated by the Peeler motion,
Chambers will appoint the new curriculum reform
study group to “advocate major proposals and
positions’ that have emerged in the course of re-
cent debate.

One of the ‘major proposals” which is likely to

plan for general education by the dean and Pro-
fessor of Psychology Roger Tarpy that many
faculty members are already in favor of because
of its looser construction of requirements.

Two parts of the Curriculum Committee’s plan,
calling for the implementation of language and
mathematics requirements, had already been
given tentative approval of the Arts and Sciences
faculty, which has been debating weekly since
Oct. 29.

The need for flexibility was urged throughout
the Nov. 24 session, however, with Professor of
Education Charles Jones saying that reform plans
would ‘tend to batch process” students here.

In making his motion to end the present debate
on general education — which began in 1976 with
the college curriculum committee’s first study of
reform — Peeler said he could ‘‘not see how we
can get a plan now that everybody likes,”

Union county income

Union county residents, with a 1978 median in-

Union’s figure compares with $8,468 annual in-
come in Northumberland County, $9,904 in
Lycoming, $9,719 in Centre and $10,117 in Snyder.

Hawkings elected new Bucknellian editor

Bucknellian Managing Editor David Hawk-
ings ’82 was elected editor of the newspaper at
an editorial board meeting Nov. 24.

Hawkings, a political science major from
New York City, has also served as News
editor and consultant during four semesters
of involvement on the staff. He was editor of
the Hotchkiss Record and has spent two sum-
mers on the staff of The Times-Union in
Albany, N.Y.

“Tm tremendously happy with the amount
the paper has improved this semester and my
main priority will be to continue to improve
upon quality,” Hawkings said. He said he will
institute a massive writer recruitment pro-
gram in January and at the beginning of next

semester and intends to find assistants for the
five section editors.

Hawkings also plans to speak with faculty
and administration to make them more
aware of the “‘inordinate time commitment”
required of the staff. “This is the number one
student organization in terms of time commit-
ment, with many members of the editorial
board spending a 40 hour work week at the of-
fice,” Hawkings said.

The Features section will not be appearing
every week, but only when a suitable subject
presents itself. The other sections — News,
Opinions, Arts and Sports — will continue in
their present format, the editor-elect said.

In staff appointments made thus far, Hawk-
ings has named Orlando B. Hanselman ’81 as
business manager, Lisa Michels ’82 as sales
manager, and Steven Medoff 84 as produc-
tion manager.

Editors selected include current Features
Editor Lynne Rutherford ’82 as Arts Editor
and Copy Editor Kris Forsythe 81 as Opin-
ions Editor. Carl Jensen ’83 will continue as
photography editor, and current Editor Ken
Quaas ’82 will also remain on the editorial
board, Hawkings said.

Current News Editor Matt Karanian 82 and
Sports Editor Jeff Cross °82 will be serving as
associate editors next semester, he said.

Canadian exchange proposed
by small faculty group here

By MARC ELLIOTT

A small group of University
faculty is hoping to institute an
exchange program with Cana-
da’s Carleton University next
year, to foster a program in
Canadian studies.

If the proposed program is im-
plemented, the University would
join the ranks of an elite group of
institutions which sponsor pro-
grams in Canadian studies —
among them Yale, Harvard,
Duke, Rochester and Johns
Hopkins Universities.

According to Associate Pro-
fessor of Economics Peter Kresl,
the idea of exchanging faculty
and students with a Canadian
university is not a new one, nor is

faculty and student interest in
Canada a recent phenomenon.

“There have been six or seven
Jan Plans to Canada in the past
nine years,” Kresl said, adding
that many Canadians _partici-
pated in Spring Colloquy here
three years ago. A recent grant
from a University trustee has
also been allocated to support ef-
forts to attract more Canadian
lecturers here.

Kresl, the leader of these ef-
forts, likened the process of
organizing the program to the
consolidation of the International
Relations major here. Currently,
four departments — economics,
French, geography, and socio-
logy — offer six courses which

focus on Canadian/American
relations.

Consequently, the University’s
Carleton exchange program
would be a “‘multi-disciplined ex-
change,’ Kresl stated, with
faculty members exchanging
positions on a one-to-one basis,
and even exchanging “‘houses, if
possible.”

There are several benefits to be
incurred with a faculty exchange,
Kresl said. Bucknell would
receive the services of experts in
their respective areas of Cana-
dian studies. It might also be
possible to schedule exchanges to
place the Carleton faculty
members in positions left tem-
porarily vacant by University
faculty members on sabbatical,
Kresl said.

“T think it adds flexibility to our
curriculum. It’s really great for
the faculty to get out and do
something different,” he added.

Carleton has a student enroll-
ment of 14,000 and employs 650
faculty members teaching
undergraduate and graduate
study programs. Its location in
Ottawa makes it readily accessi-
ble to the cultural resources of
that city.

Kresl said he is optimistic
about the prospects for beginning
the program next year. ‘The
Canadians at Carleton are very
keen on it (the exchange),” he
said. “I’ve received broad sup-
port among faculty and ad-

AFSCME, Teamsters, cool efforts as support wanes

. ByMATTKARANIAN

In contrast to the frenzied union and counterunion ac-
tivity here as recently as two years ago, the organization
debate among non-professionals, union leaders and the
administration appears to have ground toa halt.

Most employees contacted in the physical plant and din-
ing service — those workers who have been the target of
union organizers in the past — said they are “satisfied”
with their jobs and with the wages they are earning.

Although a few non-professionals here dissented, even
the dissatisfied reported they would not be sympathetic to
attempts by union leaders to organize them and to serve
as their collective bargaining agent.

And apparently in response to these attitudes, union
organizers have ceaséd active efforts here.

William Fogle, staff representative for the American
Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees
(AFSCME) said Thursday he is ‘“‘not actively pursuing”’
organizational efforts.

He said he would not “solicit” support at the University,
but said that if he received inquiries, he would ‘check
them out.” Fogle added that although he has had ‘“‘some”’
responses from the University’s non-professional
employees, it has been ‘‘nothing to get excited about.”

Likewise, the Teamsters, who have been involved in
organizational efforts here also, but to a much lesssr
degree than AFSCME, have not planned ‘‘anything
definite right at this time,” according to Business
Representative Organizer Robert Johnson.

Although Johnson said Thursday the Teamsters would
“proceed on organizing” and eventually ‘follow up on
group meetings,” the union has yet to hold an organiza-
tional meeting here, and has not sent mailings to
employees since August.

One employee of the dining service who asked not to be
named said although she was “not satisfied with the
wages,” and “‘feels cheated,” she would not favor unioniz-
ing. She said if she could get her problems solved “‘without

distributing other campaign
materials through resident
assistants and under dormitory
room doors, according to the
complaints.

Dzurinko said, in a carefully-
worded statement, however, that
an ABS official study of the elec-
tion — before the decision was
made to have a new vote —
revealed ‘‘no ill intent by either
candidate” and that the viola-
tions ‘‘were a result of the actions
that reflected the intense feelings
of supporters on both sides.”

“Because the election vote was
close,”’ the statement said, ‘‘it is
indeterminable whether these
violations swayed the election.”
The ABS investigation consisted
of interviews with both can-
didates and several resident
assistants and residence direc-
tors and the review and checking
of the facts in all the formally-
lodged complaints.

“T think that it was better to
clarify the question, rather than
allow the election to have been
cast in doubt,”’ Dzurinko said, ad-
ding that the ABS decision ‘“‘was
the most just alternative—we had
to do it.”

Suarez said Wednesday that
“The second election made the
first election a travesty,” and
that it “harmed the images of
both candidates and the ABS.”

“The voters who turned out for
the election were cheated
because they took the time and
effort to go to the polls and their
vote meant little or nothing,”
Suarez said.

Thum said after his defeat
Thursday night that “The ABS
handled the election very well,”

adding that he is ‘‘sure (Suarez)
will do a great job.”

The contesting of the presiden-
tial election by the ABS Steering
Committee did not effect the
other results of the election held
the Tuesday before Thanksgiv-
ing. In the most hotly contested of
the other steering committee
races, junior Andy Brody
defeated freshman Dan Huck by
60 votes for treasurer.

Missy Campbell ’82 easily
defeated Bill Walz ’82, 538 to 353
for the second spot in the student
government heirarchy, and Lon
Castle won an uncontested race
for ABS secretary with more than
90 percent of the vote.

After learning of his victory,
Suarez said Thursday he does not
want to “‘dwell on the election,
but to get straight to work.
Everyone in the ABS Congress
will have to work together in
order to be more productive,”
Suarez said.

Suarez said he plans to lay the
groundwork for his administra-
tion by working with the new
steering committee in January.
“T also want to work with the cur-
rent steering committee to learn
from their mistakes and to
benefit from their ac-
complishments to make the new
administration an even better
one,”’ Suarez said.

Dzurinko said that “our ex-
perience will assure that the new
steering committee will get off to
a good start,” and that he is look-
ing forward to aiding Suarez in
making the transition to the new
administration.

the union’’ it would be “‘better.”’ She said she is “always
hopeful,’’ but refused to identify herself because she said
the administrators ‘“‘can make it rough for you.” She add-
ed ‘‘nobody here seems to be interested in the union.”

Bob Hoyer, also a dining service employee, said he was
“not satisfied” with his wages, but added he did not
“know if a union would help.”

Physical Plant employee Ed Lech disagreed, however.
He said ‘‘wages could be better,” and that he would sup-
port a union ‘‘if they could help us.”

Several other Physical Plant workers said they were
“satisfied,” however, with one adding “it’s not bad here.”
He said, ‘“‘you just do your job and be done with it.” Regar-
ding support for a collective bargaining agent, he said
“nobody expresses their feelings. Everyone keeps to
himself.”

Another employee said union activity is something that
is ‘‘never discussed. We never think to talk,” he said.

“As far as we know, the issue’s dead.”

Surveys show support fora fall break

ABS finds 73 percent of faculty supportive

By DAVID GROSSMAN

In a recent survey conducted by the ABS, faculty
members indicated they are greatly in favor of the
mid-semester break.

The survey was distributed to the entire faculty
body, and was responded to by 89 professors. It
showed 65 of them — approximately 73 percent — in
favor to the mid-term vacation. Twenty more facul-
ty were opposed to the vacation, and nine of those
who answered had no comment on whether the
break was worthwhile or not.

Most of the faculty members in favor of the vaca-
tion felt that class attendance was the same as it
usually is, and that it provided a “psychological
lift” for students as well as themselves. This ‘“‘lift’’,
as indicated in the questionnaire, creates ‘‘op-
portunity for more productive academic
endeavors.”’ Most of these professors did not report
that excessive absence or lax work attitudes
developed from the break.

On the other hand, faculty members who opposed
the vacation reported their attendance to have
either been slightly or unacceptably off immediate-
ly before and after the break, and that valuable
class days were lost. Some of these professors

thought that instead of observing a fall break, a full
week recess should be scheduled at Thanksgiving.

Several of the faculty members who answered the
survey elaborated on their essentially ‘‘yes and no”
responses. One professor said, ‘The break is essen-
tial. By the third week of October, everybody is suf-
fering from the relentlessness of study and work.
This year’s bit of refreshment has already shown in
improved work.”

Another respondent said “Attendance was
dismal! Class program was seriously disrupted for
several days.’’ Others who commented praised the
opportunity that everyone was given to breathe dur-
ing the break, and also felt that the break takes
away invaluable class time by cutting down on
scheduled class days.

Another survery has been distributed to faculty
by Joseph La Barge, Chairperson of the Committee
on Instruction. The questionnaire asks only those
professors who experienced severe decrease in at-
tendance before and after the vacation period to
respond. They are requested to include their name,
the class, the number of students enrolled in the
class, and the number of absences in a given day.

Faculty poll produces six complaints

By DAVID GROSSMAN

Ina survey distributed by Head Professor and Associate of Religion
Joseph LaBarge, Chairman of the University Committee on Instruc-
tion, only six faculty members reported a significant amount of
absences during the two class days before and after the midsemester
break.

According to the memorandum, only violations of academic com-
mitment “‘by a significant number of students” needed to be reported.
However, LaBarge said some of the responding faculty members
reported absence rates that were somewhat less significant.

LaBarge said, ‘‘most of the complaints that I received involved
large numbers of absentees curing Friday (afternoon) classes.”
Reports of poor attendance the two days following the vacation were
less frequent.

When the faculty passed an amendment against cancellation of
classes to supplement the fall break proposal, they ‘‘determined that
the continuation of any fall break will be contingent upon both faculty
and students honoring their respective academic commitments.”

This stipulation largely created the motive for LaBarge’s survey, as
the purpose of the memorandum was to enable faculty members to
report blatant abuses to the vacation privilege, LaBarge said.

In turn, the amount and intensity of responses that LaBarge re-
ea would influence to any suggestions he or his committee will
make.

Because of the few complaints he received, and also because of the
several positive responses cultivated by the ABS survey, LaBarge
said he plans to voice his support for the continuation of the mid-
semester break at the next faculty meeting.

Leadership fraternity
announces 13 members

Omicron Delta Kappa, a national leadership honor society, has an-
nounced the acceptance of 13 new members to its chapter here.

This semester’s inductees are Pam Ecock ’82, Kathy Kelley ’82,
Anne Kennedy ’82, David O’Connell ’82, Susan Roth ’81, Joe
Ruszkiewicz ’82, Beth Sipple ’82, Dave Stewart ’81, John Stillman ’81,
Michael Suarez ’82, Scott Thistle ’82, Bill Thum ’82 and Ken
Wolckenhauer ’82.

The society sends out invitations to apply for membership each
semester to the top 35 percent of the junior-and senior classes, based
on cumulative GPA. Those applying were asked to indicate leadership
experience in five categories: scholarship, social and religious ac-
tivities, creative and performing arts, journalism and mass media,
and athletics.

More than 100 applicants responded to the invitations, according
to David Polsky ’81, president of the local circle. The 13 new members
were chosen by the current membership after several weeks of
deliberation.

Omicron Delta Kappa’s most recent activity here was the spon-
sorship of ex-Bucknell professor Stuart Rothenberg’s lecture on the

rise of conservatism, held here on Nov. 17.

percent merit increase.

Saying that “last year we got
stung,” Zeller said the economy
is often too variable to predict ac-
curately. Wages and salaries
went up 8 percent and tuition nine
in the last year, but inflation
finished in the teens, and the
faculty’s request for a much big-
ger increase in wages is to make
up for that discrepancy.

Guidelines 10 and 11 will both
be discussed by the Finance Com-
mittee of the board today, but
they are almost certain to refer it
to the trustees’ Executive Com-
mittee for final action in late
January or early February, when
Zeller said ‘the economy will be
easier to predict.”

“No one knows what the
economy will be like 19 months
from now,” he said, ‘‘and so we
have to tend to be conservative.”

ABS President John Dzurinko
’g1—in his last meeting as chair-
man of the congress — question-
ed the University’s policy of only
using 5 percent of the return on
its investment portfolio each
year, asking if the trustees would
be willing to raise the percentage

to eleviate the burden placed on
tuition income.

“The managers will always put

so they will invest prudently,”
Zeller said. The average total
return on the University’s in-
vestments last year kept pace
with inflation at 13 percent, he
said.

Zeller told the audience at the
meeting—a group of 40 drastical-
ly smaller than the hundreds who
have packed the meetings in the
past two years—that Bucknell is
not pricing itself out of the com-
petitive college market.

The average cost of a year here
has kept pace with the price of
the average family car,” he said,
adding that the University “gives
more money percentage-wise for
student aide when compared with
‘frame of reference’ institutions
but less money overall.”

The action by the ABS Con-
gress to repudiate the latest
guidelines reverses a pattern of
action on the budget the group
has taken recently. In 1978, the
ABS endorsed “‘the inevitability
of a $600 increase,’ but the

January phon-a-thon planners
foresee successful fund drive

Plans’ for the annual January phon-a-thon are nearing matricula-

tion, and the fund raiser is

expected to be successful, according to

assistant Director of Annual Giving Bob Kallin.
Students here will attempt to reach all of the University’s approx-
imately 30,000 alumni during 18 nights of calling in January. Kallin

said 28,000 alumni were

called last year,

and that the 350 student

volunteers were able to get through to 11,000 of them.
Kallin said he hopes the 1981 phon-a-thon will be as successful. Last
year nearly half those contacted made pledges averaging $39. A total

of $166,000 was raised.

The funds raised in the phon-a-thon — which are earmarked for the
Annual Fund — are already budgeted and will be spent by the end of

June, 1981, according to Kallin.
The student steering committee

for the fund-raiser is chaired by

Tuition rise of $1115 foreseen

if faculty gets salary demands

From TUITION, page 1

The motion was actually a for-
mal endorsement of the monthly
report of the University Commit-
tee on Planning and Budget as
delivered by Assistant Professor
of Physics Stephen Becker, who
has been leading the fight in the
faculty for higher wages since
1978.

In making the motion to en-
dorse the report calling for a 15
percent salary hike, Chairman
and Associate Professor of
Political Science John Peeler ac-
cused the trustees of “holding out
for the minimum” salary in-
crease possible and “daring the
faculty to ask for more.”

The statement prompted a
heated exchange between Peeler
and University President Dennis
O’Brien in front of the 140 faculty
who nearly filled the University
Center Forum and comprised the
largest body of faculty to gather
for a monthly meeting since the
salary debate a year ago.

“7 don’t think it’s fair to at-
tribute ill-will to the trustees,”
O’Brien said. ‘Students want less
and the faculty wants more. Both

or SS yy)

are legitimate, and these people
are just trying to do what is best
for the University,” he said.

O’Brien pledged, however, to
“make the best case possible for
the highest salary increase possi-
ble” when the board meets today
and Saturday and when the final
decision is made by the trustees’
Executive Committee sometime
within the next two months.

“We're all looking for a posi-
tion to live with,” the president
said, but he added he would not
ask the trustees to commit the
University to raising its wages
parallel to any economic index,
as many faculty have suggested.

After approving the Planning
and Budget Committee’s report,
the faculty began discussion of
the report of the Personnel Com-
mittee on the plans for allocating
the 3 percent merit increase the
faculty had asked for, although
there was sharp division among
the faculty about support for the
committee’s plan.

A various number of altera-
tions to the report by the Person-
nel Committee were proposed
and discussed .

‘Insider’s Guide’ story on Bucknell
is critical of student body values here

From INSIDER’S GUIDE, page 1

Co-editor Klein said it was he who spoke to Levine and
disputed Levine’s statement that ‘‘most of what’s there
is mine.”

Klein said Levine ‘is wrong. We did not use a lot of
what he wrote in. He sent me a long review and we cuta
lot of it because it was personally biased.”’ Klein said,
however, that sentences were taken ‘‘verbatim’”’ from
Levine’s comments and he was the only one who ‘‘con-
tributed written remarks.”

Klein said he had “‘a lot of input” for the Bucknell
review but not as much as he would have liked. He said
that he telephoned three personal friends here and got
information from them but refused to give their names.
Co-editor Allen said she sent three of her friends who are
students here questionnaires but got no response.

Both Klein and Allen said they sent several question-
naires to the Bucknellian but received no responses.
Allen said the Guide solicits college newspapers because
they “provide the most literate response.’’ She said that
the guide makes repeated mailings and phone calls to
get a variety of responses and opinions.

Andy Marsh ’81, Bucknellian editor during the fall of
1979, said he received a questionnaire but did not have
time to respond and did not consider it a priority. He said
he was satisfied with what had previously been written
in the guide.

Marsh said he did not know Levine responded to the
Guide’s inquiries.

Allen said “my goal was to have more than one person
write the review and I did everything I could to avoid it.
But if the schools don’t respond, we have to do the best
we can.”

She said it was “possible,” however, that a review
could consist mostly of one person’s opinion. “It’s hap-
pened,” she said.

Klein, who according to both editors supervised the
Bucknell review, refuted Allen’s statement. He said the
staff did not depend on one person’s opinion. He said
they ‘‘paste together information” and ‘rewrite it.”
Klein said the staff tried to check the information given
them but added “‘we can’t do it all.”

University Director of Admissions Richard Skelton
said he ‘“‘deesn’t place a lot of stock in it’’ (the Guide).
He said the publication has not “requested any technical
information” from his office, adding that “they appear
to take minor points and make them into major ones.”

Compiled and edited by
the staff of

Che Pale Daily News

He said his office has had no contact with the Guide
“in at least 10 years.”

Both Allen and Klein disagreed. Allen said she sent
mailings to the admissions office here in February 1979 5
requesting statistics and received a reply. “Someone in The recently published Insider's Guide to the Col-
that office took it upon himself to reply” she said. Allen leges contains a report on the University saying that

against injustice, for example) be warned
that the conservative, limited student body
specialized in groupthink and demands con-
formity. It tends to isolate individualists and
independent personalities.

Social life goes along the same lines.

Parties consist mostly of mobbed fraterni-
ty affairs (this year over seventy percent of
the freshmen men joined fraternities) and
doing as much damage to the brain cells as
possible. Beer and pot top the list of favorite
controlled substances (remember the Penn-
sylvania drinking age is twenty-one). Co-
caine and various forms of speed are next in
order of appreciation.

Even some of the most gung-ho ‘‘animal
house” types admit they are a little bored of
the same old frat parties, but that’s just
about all there is in the Central Susquehanna
Valiey, except for a flashy new disco called
the Great Green Frog that opened last year
in nearby Milton (home of Chef Boy-Ar-
Dee).

Sex? Well, the stereotype goes that a
Bucknell girl thinks anything more than a

that seems pretty much to be the case. But
the student sex information group claims the
yearly abortion rate is up in the hundreds.
Neither of these extremes is particularly
close to the truth, in all likelihood. But don’t
go looking to,Bucknell for a few years of pas-
sionate nights in bed, unless you plan on
spending them alone.

Moving around to the academic side,
students in the sciences, and business and
engineering majors work themselves into a
frenzy of academic pressure. They work
hard and are typically rewarded with good
jobs. Liberal arts majors can get by quite
nicely with practically no work. The faculty
js dedicated and brilliant, but largely wasted
on students who don’t care.

Bucknell engineering is associated nation-
wide with prestige, and lots of it. Several
psychology professors have national reputa-
tions for their work, although it appears that
some of the most well known may be seeking
positions elsewhere. Biology is also strong.

most loved teacher, known for his popular
English course on Shakespeare. He inter-
prets ‘the Bard” with a touch of historical
relevance in addition to literary and
psychological aspects, earning the deep
respect of almost all his students

History’s favorite is Britain specialist
Mark Neuman. His classes and seminars
take students far beyond the feared rote of
chronological events and enter subtle and
revealing aspects of England’s culture,
society, literature, and people. Neuman’s
Victorian and Edwardian offerings are par-
ticularly rewarding.

The faculty recently approved a new inter-
national relations major, which promises to
rise quickly to the forefront of education at
Bucknell. This program features the
juvenile antics of Tom Travis, who manages
to convince his students that he is brilliant. A
semester’s work with Travis should prove to
be highly entertaining as well as in-
formative.

Most of the other departments are
satisfactory to excellent. Sociology is badly
in need of some ,strong professors and
English professors should be chosen with
care. (There is said to be a lot of tenured
dead weight over in the English wing.) The
business department is i; shambles, due to a
high rate of professor turnover and
dissatisfaction.

The main problem at Bucknell is lack of
student diversity. The admissions depart-
ment clearly strives to pick the Bucknell
brand of student and so robs each enrolling
class of one of the most important aspects of
college life: getting to know different types
of people.

Some members of the college community
go so far as to state that admissions policies
discriminate against certain minority
groups. But recent studies indicate that peo-
ple who see the Bucknell stereotype, and
realize that they don’t fit it, simply choose
another school

Lewisburg’s somewhat backward rural at-
mosphere may be refreshing to urban or
suburban freshmen, but the glow of
wholesome countryside soons wears off
when they realize that they are noplace — in
the middle of nowhere. The town offers a
movie theater, a car wash, and the campus
bowling alley and bar — locally known as
Dunkle’s. Penn State is the only notable
school nearby, one hour to the west.

One of Bucknell’s Outstanding qualities is
its campus. The nickname “Country Club on
the Susquehanna” is not unearned. The
Georgian buildings and perfect grounds are
kept in top condition.

A multi-million dollar field house is the
latest addition to campus facilities. Indoor
tennis, jogging, racquetball, and other
sports are available here. But faculty
members and the more astute students
notice that Bucknell decided it needed a new
gym before a life-sciences building, a
theater, or a music and arts center. Of
course. Beer before wine. Indeed, beer

Dzurinko reflects on ABS

upon retirement as president

By TRICIA KENNEDY

Do students here have a
responsibility to be involved in
student government?

The answer, according to retir-
ing Association of Bucknell
Students President John
Dzurinko ’81 is an emphatic
Ses.

“Bucknell is our institution and
we (the students) should actively
participate to make it ours,”
Dzurinko said, adding, ‘‘We must

Dzurinko defined the student con-
gress as a “discussion - oriented’’
group. Its function, he said, is to
debate certain issues and to voice
specific student reactions to
University proposals.

Dzurinko named the approval
of recycling as a University
policy and the drafting of a
specific program for the third
floor of the University Center as
two of the major accom-

NEWSMAKERS

be willing to work on issues that
are of concern to us.”’

Dzurinko criticized students
here for their lack of interest in
affecting change in University
policy. There is concern that
students with career goals have
directed their sense of respon-
sibility away from the larger
view of University life toward
merely fulfilling their curriculum
requirements, according to
Dzurinko.

He cited the low turn-out of 40
students at Monday’s ABS
meeting to discuss the 1981-82 tui-
tion increase as an example of
growing student apathy here.

“The ABS cannot deal with
such issues effectively if students
don’t show a real interest,”
Dzurinko said.

Answering charges that the
ABS is an_ ineffective body,

plishments of his administra-
tion.

Dzurinko came under fire twice
during his presidency for his pro-
posals emphasizing the im-
portance of student government.
His plan last winter to make a
“practical application of
academics to community work”
was criticized in a Feb. 22
Bucknellian editorial as being
“an alarming departure’ from
the traditional campus - oriented
concerns of student government.
More recently, Dzurinko’s pro-
posal for course credits to the
ABS president and to certain
other student leaders drew
criticism.

“People are scared of muddy-
ing the distinction between cur-
ricular and extracurricular ac-
tivities,’ Dzurinko said, in
answer to criticisms of both pro-
posals. He stressed that non-

traditional study can be just as
“meaningful and important” as
traditional study and can in fact
“enrich” the traditional cur-
riculum.

Pete Francino ’81, current vice
- president of the ABS, said
Dzurinko “has been frustrated in
achieving his goals because of the
students’ attitudes, and because
of what they value. They don’t
desire the kind of complete
education John is talking about.”

Dean of Student Affairs John
Dunlop, the ABS advisor, char-
acterized Dzurinko as some-
one ‘who believes strongly in
student government, and has
done his best to help the ABS find
what its proper role should be.””

Dzurinko, formerly the presi-
dent of the student body at
Monessen High School,
Monessen, Pa., has been active in
student organizations in his seven
semesters here. He has been in-
volved with the Recycling Ser-
vice, the National Energy Con-
servation Challenge, and the
Students for Environmental
Awareness. He also served as the
vice - president of the ABS. Mike
Suarez ’82 will succeed him as
president of the ABS next year.

USA warns against

Soviet intervention

White House officials said
Thursday they did not think a
Soviet invasion of Poland was
likely to occur, thus toning down
their earlier sharp warnings to
the USSR.

Josef Klasa, head of the Cen-
tral Committee Department for
Relations with the media in
Poland, said Thursday, however,
that the Polish leadership might
ask for Soviet assistance if
socialism became endangered
there.

He announced at a news con-
ference in Warsaw that the USSR
might be called in if ‘authority
slipped into the hands of anti-
socialist elements.”

The White House said Tuesday
it would be a mistake to assume
the United States ‘lacks the will
or ability to respond appropriate-
ly” to Soviet aggression in
Poland during President Carter’s
lame duck administration.

College admissions

now request waiver

Colleges across the nation have
asked applicants for admission to
waive their right of access to in-
formation in their files in record
numbers in the past year.

The Family Educational
Rights and Privacy Act of 1975
granted matriculated students
access to their admission files,
but colleges are permitted to ask
students to waive their right of
access to specific documents.
Colleges have routinely re-
quested applicants to waive their
right of access to letters of
recommendation.

Such requests now appear to
have developed into a nationwide
trend. Admission officers on a
dozen college campuses have
reported to the New York Times
that they believed the waivers

were necessary to assure
frankness on the part of teachers
and others writing the students’
recommendations.

Bucknell includes a waiver
statement for applicants for ad-
mission to the University.

Gov. Grasso will

resign from office

Connecticut Gov. Ella Grasso
announced at the State House in
Hartford Thursday she will
resign from her gubernatorial
post effective Dec. 31.

Grasso said she no longer has
the strength to work, and
therefore cannot complete her
term. She is undergoing
chemotherapy for cancer of the
liver, a condition she revealed
she had Nov. 26.

According to a report in the
Hartford Courant, although
cancer of the liver can somtimes
be treated, experts agree it is
usually incurable. Its sources
reported that only a few people
live as long as one year with any
kind of liver cancer.

Grasso, who was operated on
for cancer of the ovary in April,
was readmitted to Hartford
Hospital Nov. 16 for treatment of
phlebitis. The new cancer was
discovered during routine testing
Nov. 24.

The governor is now an out-
patient, and is being treated at
the Governor’s Mansion. She will
be succeeded by Lt. Governor
William O’Neil.

Princeton U violates
free speech rights

The New Jersey State Supreme
Court ruled Nov. 25 that
Princeton University broke the
free speech guarantees of the
State Constitution when it had a
member of the U.S. Labor Party
arrested for trespassing as he
passed out political pamphlets on
campus April 5, 1978.

“The attempt to disseminate
political material was not com-
patible with either Princeton
University’s professed educa-
tional goals or the university’s
overall use of its property for
educational purposes,’’ the
Supreme Court said in support of
the ruling.

Male-only draft to
be debated by court

The constitutionality of a male -
only draft will be debated by the
Supreme Court this Court term.

The appeal to carry out the
debate came from a lower court
decision that declared male-only
draft registration unconstitu-
tional.

If the Supreme Court defends
this position, Congress will have
to decide whether to change the
Military Selective Service Act to
include women, or leave the
country with an invalid rule for
military installation.

A decision that the existing
separate treatment of men and
women in military context is
justified could make future
defense of sex-based distinctions
easier.

Deer hunters seek
750,000 local deer

The Pennsylvania Game Com-
mission released an optimistic
report for Union County deer
hunters this year. The hunting
season for antlered deer opened
Monday and continues through
Dec. 13. The doe season is
scheduled for Dec. 15-16.

The report is based on informa-
tion compiled from field officers
observation. The state’s pre-

season deer number approx-
imately three quarters of a
million, a slight increase over
last year’s population, according
the Commission.

With this report came warnings
from game protector Bernard
Schmader that safety precau-
tions be maintained by hunters.
Last year, there were 17 shooting
accident victims in the county.

Nuclear waste to be

carried on I-80

The Nuclear Regulatory Com-
mission plans to use I-80 as a ma-
jor route for the cross-country
shipping of high-level nuclear
waste, according to Thomas
Gerusky, director of the state’s
Bureau of Radiological Protec-
tion.

In a press conference Nov. 25,
Gerusky said however, that
although Route 80 is marked on
an NRC map outlining approved
nuclear waste shipping routes in
the state, there is presently no
place to ship the waste.

He did not rule out the possibili-
ty of a low-level depository being
built in Pennsylvania, however.
The NRC would like to store the
wastes in the state’s underground
geological formations, but high
water tables and the lack of suffi-
ciently wide mineral veins have
hampered such plans.

The NRC first considered loca-
tions with underground salt
deposits, but after protests from

Letter from the editor

Is that really you over there on the right? Well, the Insiders
Guide to the Colleges thinks so — or at least one former student who
wrote to them and called us middle-class beer-drinking job hunters.
Unfortunately, he didn’t say if he fit the same stereotype.

If you don’t know what I’m talking about then you didn’t read the
article on the front page of this newspaper, and probably didn’t read
the excerpt from the book reprinted on page 10. But if you didn’t read
that you’re probably not reading this so don’t worry.

Maybe that’s part of the problem. If you’re not reading your col-
lege newspaper and you don’t go to a play or a lecture or an or-
chestra concert at least once in awhile then you’re really wasting
your time here and you may as well be taking a correspondence
course at home for your B.A. or B.S. — and maybe you should worry
— because you’re wasting the money that you’re trying to earn.

I guess it’s the grades that gets you that job. And it’s probably
idealistic to think that it shouldn’t be, but if plain schoolwork and
good grades were everything then you wouldn’t be reading this.
That’s the point and if you still don’t get it, the “Y”’ on that guy’s
chest over there might mean you.

It’s been fun being Editor, but now my grades are hurting and I
might not get that job.

Transitions

The end of a semester brings transitions of all types. From our
cozy basement offices, we can see the colors get bleaker and the
days get shorter as winter approaches outside, and on the inside we
prepare for a new editor. These are the normal and methodic events
of every December here in Lewisburg.

The transition now underway within the organization of the ABS
has been far less than methodic or normal. The first contested elec-
tion since 1977 was lamentably contested in more ways than one,
with opponents Suarez and Thum competing with enough overdone
fervor to warrant a second — and more civilized — contest.

While the offensive campaign tactics are of course regrettable,
the actions of the outgoing ABS steering committee. are entirely
commendable. After reacting with a bit of bewildered surprise,
President John Dzurinko acted with careful, considered judgment to
ascertain the facts and orchestrate a quick, nonbiased solution. Far
from demeaning the candidates and the ABS — as the winner accus-
ed — the president legitimized the potentially rancerous mess and
provided a fitting tribute to the end of his yearlong tenure.

Dzurinko has indeed come a long way since we first worried that
he might not ‘‘remember his constituents’ after he succeeded Phil
Andrews last January. But John’s soft, homespun ideology of
idealism has servedus well, and it is his constituents who should now
remember him.

We of course wish Michael Suarez the best as he begins his tran-
sition into the chair. Given the apparent indiscretions of the past
week, it may be a hard transition; given the performance of John
Dzurinko, it may be a tough chair to fill.

Redirected recycling

Professor Charles Coder has $4,633 of Recycling Group funds
locked away in a local bank beyond the access of group members.
He refuses to return the money to the group unless it is used for a
scholarship for local high school students. The group has said it
wants to use the funds to expand the club’s program.

Coder’s control of the money dates back to when he was the
club’s advisor. He no longer holds the position, but has never relin-
quished control of the funds.

The University Committee on Complementary Activities is
seeking to resolve the conflict and is making recommendations to
bring the controversy to a conclusion.

Chairman of the committee Bill Thum ’82 said among the com-
mittee’s non-binding recommendations will be one that the Recycl-
ing Group use the funds for scholarship if possible.

We agree with this recommendation. The Recycling Group
should consider all possible uses for its funds, and should not merely
grow for growth’s sake. The group should also consider setting aside
a percentage of its profits for endeavors such as Coder’s proposed
scholarship.

But the decision is that of the group — it’s their money.

Coder’s rationale may be benevolent and well-intended, but he is
wrong in his tyrannical clutch of the funds. Coder’s stubborn
behavior is unbecoming of his profession. It’s not his money.

Tastes, preferences & criticisms?

To the Editor:

We would like to point an ap-
parent discrepancy in
Bucknellian policy. Although
there is a page in each issue
clearly marked “‘Opinions,”’ opi-
nions have not been confined to
that section. The reviewers of
music, theater and dance have
repeatedly utilized the “Arts”
space for articles expressing
tastes, preferences and
criticisms without labeling their
comments as personal views. We
hesitate to question their
knowledge and credentials since
we do not know their back-
grounds. However, we suspect
that their insights are not suffi-

ciently educated or valuable to be
informative.

Reviews need not be the same
as opinions or pointed criticisms.
For example, in the Nov. 21, 1980
issue, David Hawkings viewed
the New Globe Theatre’s Nov. 20
performance of ‘The Glass
Menagerie”’ as “‘sporadic,” and
called it “‘bland and occasionally
confusing.” Instead of berating
the interpretation, which was ad-
mittedly not traditional, he might
have objectively analyzed and at-
tempted to understand the ver-
sion. Alternatively, he might
have made use of true profes-
sionals, including English and
drama professors, in formulating
his critical evaluation.

Continuing saga of the
Bucknell Chapel Choir

To the Editor:

As a college chaplain, I am keenly interested in ways to provide

music for Sunday morning Chapel

services. I remember fondly the

well-sung anthems of the Bucknell Chapel Choir and its expert direc-
tion under Professor William D. McRae. Consequently, I was surpris-
ed to learn that since McRae’s retirement, the choir no longer sings
every Sunday and that the membership of the group has fallen away to
a mere shadow of its former strength.

Recent articles demand that President O’Brien study the current
situation to determine what steps must be taken to insure a strong
musical contribution to Bucknell’s chapel program. The work of any
chapel choir must be geared to the overall program of the Chapel ser-
vices. Clearly the new directions taken by the choir ignore the fun-

damental purposes for its existence.

The purpose

Nov. 20, 1980

of a news-

paper is to inform

To the Editor:

I have been receiving the
Bucknellian for two years and as
the editor of another private col-
lege weekly newspaper I would
like to comment on this
semester’s Bucknellian. Among
the seven weekly college
newspapers that I read regularly,
your newspaper has proven
superior.

Judging from several recent
letters to the Editor, some
Bucknellian readers do not ap-
preciate the relatively high quali-
ty of journalism that they read

each week. The most salient
feature is the consistent news and
sports writing style.

From working on a college
newspaper, I realize how difficult
it is to satisfy the administration,
faculty and students at the same
time, but that is not the purpose
of a newspaper—it is to inform.

To the Editor:

We would like to offer thanks to
all those who participated in the
production of the Hulley House —
Tristram Art Show now on ex-
hibit outside the Forum in the
U.C. There was an extraordinary
amount of work demanded of
those who assisted in the
organization of the show and
their efforts deserve to be
recognized. Those extensive ef-
forts contributed to what we feel
is an excellent and diverse selec-
tion of drawings, lithographs,
paintings and photographs — all
created by Bucknell students. We
encourage those who have
neglected to see the exhibit to do
so at the earliest opportunity, as
it proves to be a pleasurable and
inspiring experience.

Credentials paramount
in the Thomas decision

To the Editor:

The article, “Rothenberg returns to campus in ‘mainstream’,”’
(Bucknellian, November 21) states that ‘‘the University hired Lin-
da Thomas to replace (Stuart Rothenberg) as an instructor of
political science.” This is erroneous. In fairness to everyone involv-
ed, including Ms. Thomas, Mr. Rothenberg and those of us who par-
ticipated in filling the vacancy in question, it should be noted that
her appointment is a temporary one to replace regular members of
the department who are on leave this academic year.

Furthermore, I can state with confidence that Ms. Thomas’
credentials in light of the qualifications listed in our advertised
vacancy—and not her race or sex—were paramount in the depart-
mental recommendation that she be sought to fill that position.
From what I have observed to date, I believe Professor Thomas
has been well received by students at Bucknell.

As a temporary member of our department, Mr. Rothenberg
was highly valued. Several members of our staff worked con-
sistently for three years to help him find a permanent position at a
school where his talents as a teacher could be utilized. It was
discouraging to us, as well as to Professor Rothenberg, that this did
not materialize. I am not privy to the ‘‘type of satisfaction’ that
Stuart Rothenberg still hopes to obtain from Buckenll
(Bucknellian, November 21), but if what he seeks is consistent with
the values and aims of higher education, then I hope he gets and en-
joys it.

A realistic adm

By KRIS FORSYTHE

“Yes, itis a beautiful view, isn’t it?! And down
there in the distance you can see . .” This is just
one of the phrases a passer-by might hear during
one of Bucknell’s sales techniques: the campus
tour. Naturally, these tours are designed to lure un-
suspecting high school students to our fine institu-
tion. Assume, however, that the admissions office
hired a tourguide who said what he really thought.

“Our fountain provides a convenient spot for both
romantics and exhibitionists. On a warm night, one
can see happy loving couples gazing at each other
and naked flashers frolicking in the muddied
waters. Also, in the distance you can see our sister
institution: the Lewisburg State Penitentiary.
Luckily we have only a four-year term.

“Here we see Coleman Hall, home of the social
sciences and the 110° classrooms. Faculty have
their offices here and are always available for ad-
vice. In fact, one of students’ favorite games during
pre-registration is ‘Hunt the Advisor” — the profs
are somewhere in Coleman, one just has to hunt
through the catacombs to find them.

“Across the quad is Vaughan Literature, where
students attend classes in language, both foreign
and English. Also, such popular classes as “Art in
the Dark” and “Baby Bio”’—two massive lec-
tures—are held in the auditorium . . . the acoustics,
by the way, are surpassed only by those in Davis
Gym, where concerts are held once every other
semester.

Accept a littleresponsibility for the state of the world

By TODD G. BUCHHOLZ

Throughout the semester and
especially before writing this
final column, I’ve been implored
to stick with the funny stuff, and
avoid writing about important
and serious national and campus
matters.

Folks, there’s just too much
going on outside the dorms that
we can’tignore.

At this point, I’m sure many
are turning the page, disap-
pointed that I’m not poking fun at
the counseling service, the veg
cooks, or freshmen. For those
who want only frivolity, watch
Mork and Mindy or attend a
faculty meeting.

People are afraid to be labelled
as “intellectuals” fearing that
they will lose their friends and be
sentenced to hard labor in a
library. But forget about IQ or
SAT scores, we have a respon-
sibility — to begin thinking as
adult citizens.

“Bucknell Unive

As cliche as it sounds, we are
the next leaders of this country.

finer teachers, don’t talk about

Regardless of the details, con-
sider that three groups, all of
whom would rob us of our civil
liberties are alive and organized.

So what? “They’re all kooks
with no power,” you say. In the
late 1920s the New York Times
compared Hitler’s supporters to
a boy scout troop. They were
kooks, too.

In 1980, tell the Jews in France
or blacks in Atlanta that kooks
are powerless and no longer a
threat. How many of you even
know about the kidnappings and
murders in Atlanta or terrorism
in France?

Of course, most Bucknellians
are neither Jewish nor Black, so
it doesn’t matter, right?

Pastor Martin Niemoller, the
German theologian once said:

“First the Nazis went after the
Jews, but I was not a Jew, sol did

I don’t expect students to cry
whenever tragedy touches a
human being. But we can accept
a little more responsibility for the
state of the world.

Ever since we were young,
we’ve been asked, ‘‘What do you
want to be when you grow up?”

We've been advised by parents,
teachers and aunts how quickly
our youth would pass, how soon
we would become adults and
make decisions that would deter-
mine our future.

They were right. Jefferson
gave Americans a choice bet-
ween vigilance and liberty or ig-
norance and tyranny.

What do we want to be, now
that we’ve grown up?

‘Messiah’ comes to
Bucknell for X-mas

The University Chorale and
Symphony Orchestra will present
a sing-along performance of
Handel’s Messiah at 7:30 p.m.
Sunday, December 14, in Rooke
Chapel.

“The interesting thing about
this production is that we’re us-
ing Handel’s original orchestra-
tion for the first time at
Bucknell,” Visiting Assistant
Professor of Music Christopher
McGahan said. ‘‘The orchestra,
therefore, will be smaller and
sound different from what people
are used to, but should be in-
teresting.”

Last year the sing-in drew a
crowd of about 400 people to
Rooke Chapel, according to
McGahan.

“Tt’s great,” he said. ‘After
all, choral music is getting
groups of people together and
sharing a communal experi-
ence.”

Soloists for the performance
will be Lecturer in Music Martha
Hill, soprano; Martha Zeller of
Lewisburg, alto; Newton Gil-
christ, headmaster of a Phila-
delphia arts school, tenor. A bass
soloist has yet to be found.

Entertainment park
auditions musicians

The management of Opryland
U.S.A., a musical entertainment
theme park in Nashville, Tenn.,
is conducting its yearly talent

auditions for performers in the 14
musical productions to be staged
during the 1981 season

Singers, dancers, instrumen-
talists, pianists, conductors,
specialty acts and bands are be-
ing sought to participate in the
park’s 10th anniversary celebra-
tion. The performances begin
March 9 and run through the
summer and fall to Nov. 1.

Local auditions will be 11 a.m.
to 4 p.m. Monday at Drexel
University, Philadelphia, and 11
a.m. to 4 p.m. Tuesday at the
Pittsburgh Playhouse. The audi-
tion teams will run try-outs in 25
major cities around the country.

University artworks

are out of the closet

Works of art from the Universi-

Feb. 2.

The showing of 19th and 20th
century American art was coor-
dinated by Susan Carr ’81 as an
independent study project. In-
cluded among the artists whose
works will hang in the University
Center’s third floor museum is a
former Bucknell professor, Blan-
chard Gummo, who taught here
for 40 years.

“The main goal of this pro-
ject,” Carr said, ‘“‘is to make peo-
ple more aware that Bucknell
owns some art.”

“We’re trying to make the two
activities complementary rather
than competitive,” Ruth Bur-

dent activities, said.

Burnham, working with James
Hammerlee, director of student

The committee’s exact struc-
ture is still being debated, but

working on both the technical
aspects of the activities and
publicity. An overall manager, in
charge of directing all programs,
would be installed.

A meeting was held Wednesday

Candles and music
to enlighten service

Christmas brings many tradi-
tions — caroling, wassail and
wreaths to name a few. At
Bucknell one of the ways the
campus community celebrates
the holiday season is through a
candlelight service in Rooke
Chapel.

This year’s Festival of Lessons
and Carols will be conducted at
7:30 p.m. Sunday and Monday.

The unique thing about the ser-
vices is that for the first time the
University’s three choral groups
— the Chapel Choir, University
Chorale and Collegium Musicum
— will unite. The resultant per-
forming group will have about 100
members, according to Visiting
Assistant Professor of Music
Christopher McGahan — who is
arranging the service.

“It’s important that the music
department function as a depart-
ment. And what better time than
Christmas?” McGahan said.

The service will consist of
readings from the Old and New
Testaments of the Bible with
carols and choral pieces com-
menting on these readings. The
vocal music will range from
works of the Renaissance and
Middle Ages to ones of the 20th
century, including traditional
carols.

Also assisting in the musical of-
fering will be the University
Brass Quartet.

The service, though conducted
with candles lit, will only depend
fully on candlelight in a deeply
moving moment at the very end
of the Festival, according to
McGahan.

‘Vanities’ a subtle

By DAVID HAWKINGS

Cap and Dagger’s second
mainstage production of the
academic year opens at 8:30
tonight for a three-day run in Col-
eman Theatre, but ticketholders
had best not arrive much past
8:10.

Nor will audience members for
the production of Vanities this
weekend want to leave the
theater during either of the play’s
two intermissions, for it is before
the show begins and between its
three acts that they will see some
of the finest and most subtle

ities. She portrays a woman
who undergoes little change
in her basic character as she
progresses through the stages
of her life.

Kwanza mak

ting the Bucknell dramatic group
has given its patrons in recent
memory. .

The pre-show and the acting
between acts takes place at three
superficially similar but cleverly
different dressing tables, the
“vanities” after which the play is
named and at which the three
characters in Jack Heifner’s 1974
play sit. In this work about three
women at three chronologically
and emotionally important points
in their lives, the vanities serve
as their physical and symbolic
mirrors. We see their visual and
psychologic changes as they
dress, make-up and muse, and
the almost imperceptible altera-
tions we see at first strike us by
the end of the two-hour show with
a thought-provoking grandeur.

Heifner’s play is imbued with a
host of verbal and visual
subtleties and allusions, and the
direction of Dodie Rippon 82
brings them out with a percep-
tiveness that thankfully never
nears obviousness.

Rippon has also chosen a cast
of three women who play well
together from their beginnings as
seemingly cloned high school
cheerleaders in Act I’s opening
moment through the long and
steady progression toward their
drastically different but still
somehow strung together middle
ages.

Though the three basically
work fine together, the per-
formance of Dawn Sanderson 82

an enchanting combination of
naievete underlined with despair.

As Joanne — on the surface a
character memorable only for
her dizziness — she brings forth
her passions and confusion with
great care, adding a touch of
well-timed black humor with par-
ticular flair.

As the coquettish Mary, Anne
Clemens ’81 does well as both a
sensuous, promiscuous teenager
and a sexed-up but desensitized
35-year-old at the play’s start and
finish. Her interpretation of the
late adolescent in Act II’s transi-
tion, however, seemed flat in the

The celebration of Kwanza — a social
event sponsored by the Black Student
Alliance (BSA) which attempts to forge an
African reality for black students at the
University — began Sunday with a
ceremony at the Black Studies Interest
House.

The keynote address will be given at 8
p.m. tonight by George Trower - Subira,
author of Black Folks’ Guide to Making
Big Money in America, on the history of
Kwanza. Saturday evening Kwanza
Karamu — the Feast — the completion and
compliment of the celebration, will take
place. An artistic presentation by
Khalimah Braithwaite and an African-
style Buffet Dinner will be followed by the
performance of a student dance group and
a professional jazz presentation.

Each year much work goes into the pro-
duction of the Kwanza celebration,
because ‘‘any social event, such as Kwan-
za, promotes a political and social state-
ment on and of self,” according to a BSA
publication. ‘This is our concern: the con-
ception, growth, and fortitude of an image
determined and projected by and for black
people.”

Kwanza activities this week included a
coffeehouse Wednesday night featuring
Yvette Betts ’84, Judy Hill 81, Kennie
Johnson ’1, and Kevin Parker ’81; and a
lecture Thursday by visiting Instructor in
Political Science Linda Thomas entitled,
“Liberia; Politics of Change.”

The foundation of the Kwanza celebra-
tion is called Nguzo Saba, or the Seven
Principles of Blackness. The Principles
are Umota (Unity), Kujichagulia (Self-
determination), Ujimaa (Collective work
and responsibility) ,.Ujamaa (Cooperative

economics), Nia (Purpose), Kuumba
(Creativity) and Imani (Faith). Each has
its own candlelighting ceremony on a
designated night during the week. This
ceremony consists of explaining the Kwan-
za principle for the day, expounding the
African folklore and cultural heritage and
lighting the candle. Readings are
presented by freshmen, the youngest
members of the “family.”

Created 13 years ago for black
Americans by Dr. Ron Karenga, the
celebration signifies the “strengthening
and renewal of communal ties, and a
rededication of living and cooperating
together for the good of all,” according to
Michelle Brown ’81.

Varying in some ways from its original
conception, Kwanza at Bucknell is sym-
bolized by the concrete works black people
have built or are building in the quest for
extended freedom, according to Brown.
Appearing each winter on campus for the
past eight years, the celebration has been
extended to include an entire week only in
the last three years.

Planning for the event began in
September for Chairman Kevon Makell
81; Vice-chairman Brown, Treasurer
Noelle Greene ’81; Corresponding
Secretary Wandra Simmons 83 and
Recording Secretary Karen Merchant ’82,
all officers of the Black Student Alliance
advised by Adjunct Assistant Professor of
English James Symmons.

“The BSA has a formal membership of
about 70 students, which assumes that all
black students are members,” Brown
said. “Kwanza is more relaxed than for-
mal meetings and draws better participa-
tion from the BSA.” >. *

Chorale concert gives note to
new professor Christy Dana

By AMY FORTGANG

The University Chorale under the direction of Professor of Music
Allen Flock gave its final concert of the semester Nov. 23, turning
in a performance up to the quality audiences have come to expect
from the campus’s largest choral group.

Although the singers repeated four of its Parents’ Weekend con-
cert numbers, the program was well supplied with new pieces.

The first section of the concert was performed by a double
choir—tenors and basses on the Rooke Chapel stage were answered
by sopranos and altos in the rear balcony. The effect of this split
was a fine stereophonic sound that attested to the Chorale
members’ expertise. The most common problem with this arrange-
ment is an entrance lag on the part of one or the other of the choirs.
This potential flaw was avoided through careful rehearsal.

Appearing with the Chorale were the University Brass Quartet—
which played two pieces as well as a brass prelude to the concert—
and Visiting Instructor in Music Christy Dana—who treated the au-
dience to a short lecture demonstration on the jazz trumpet.

The major disappointment with the concert came in the last part,
in which the Chorale performed three contemporary numbers. Two
of them had been heard before and the third—‘‘Jimmie’s Got a

; Goil” by Vincent Persichetti—was an inane number that could

' easily have been eliminated from the program.

‘One of the most interesting pieces was Brahms’ ‘‘Warum ist das
Licht gegeben,” a composition for chorus and chamber choir. The
smaller vocal group—made up of 12 Chorale members—was well-
balanced and sang with the muted yet dynamic quality for which
Brahms aimed.

The cast of last year’s Jan Plan musical, Company. This year marks the third time a theater
Jan Plan has been offered. James Denton of Williamsport will direct a cast of University stu-

dents.

Another dramatic

By AMY KENNEDY

In January, a group of students and faculty
members will work on a production of the Stephen
Sondheim musical A Funny Thing Happened on the
Way to the Forum. This will be the third such pro-
duction at the University, according to Jack
Fairweather, assistant technical director for the
University Theatre.

“January is the only time during the year a
musical can be done,” Fairweather said. “The
regular slots just don’t allow enough production
days.”’ A musical requires many more rehearsals
than a straight drama does, and the sets tend to be
more complex, he explained.

If the productions continue to get directors and
the interest from students remains strong, musicals
will become a regular part of the Jan-Plan pro-
grams.

Preparations for the upcoming production have
already begun. Under the direction of James Den-

Jan Plan is staged

ton of Williamsport the large cast and crew are
working towards a February performance date.

The story of Forum revolves around the attempts
of Pseudolus (played alternatively by Barry Fishel
’81 and Patrick Pedro ’81) to win his freedom from
slavery. His young master, Hero (Peter Shaw ’84),
promises to release Pseudolus if the servant can
deliver Hero’s true love, Philia (Karen Spizzirri
’82), to him. Philia, unfortunately, has been sold to
Miles Gloriosus (Cameron Weston ’84). The situa-
tion leads to comedic confusion and chaos.

Assisting Denton in the technical aspects are
Set/Costume Designer F. Elaine Williams, visiting
assistant professor of English, Lighting Designer
David Polsky ’81, Musical Director Christopher
McGahan, visiting assistant professor of music,
Vocal Director Karen Spizzirri ’82, Choreographer
Kathleen Miller ’82, Stage Manager Bruce
Delaplane ’82 and Assistant Stage Manager Donna
Mealey ’82.

Union — including Estonia,
Lithuania and Russia. The art-
work is part of a larger collection
owned by Russian Art Images,
Ltd., of Pittsburgh, the only
gallery in the United States
handling Soviet art.

The prints on display are
specifically of folklore art. The
finely detailed and brightly col-
ored literary scenes should be
pleasing to a broad audience.

The stress of the show is on the
Lithuanian art, which has a
history rich in folk tradition
stemming from the Middle Ages.
This tradition is particularly well
represented in the works of
native artist Makunaite. Her
prints depict colorful scenes
bounded by heavy black outline
— very likely a reflection of the
famous stained glass of Kaunas
in Lithuania.

There are also some fine wood-
cuts by Russian artists, who are
considered by experts to be the
leading wood engravers in the
world today.

In addition to the Center
Gallery exhibit, photographs
from the Soviet Union are on
display in Bertrand Library. The

For those who appreciate Al Stewart’s talents, his

lew album, 24 Carrots, released after a two-year
_ absence from the public ear is another indication of

this young man’s success and will surely be another
popular album.

“Midnight Rocks”, the first single released, has

* already made its mark on the charts. It is represen-

tative of the style to which Stewart fans have

| become accustomed in Year of the Cat and Time
» Passages while still providing enough innovation to
| prevent his music from becoming tedious.

Side one introduces these new touches, which in-

| clude more emphasis on bass guitar and drums.

Piano and guitar still tend to dominate—the style
for which Stewart is recognized—but instead of be-

,. ing featured as solo instruments, the orchestration

synthesizes them to provide more accompaniment
to the vocals.

Stewart’s band, too, has also undergone many

' important—mostly personnel—changes helping to

create the subtle “rock and roll” theme pervading
his new works. Especially noticeable are Steve
Chapman, Russell Kunkel, Jeff Porcaro, Mark
Sanders and Beau Segal—the five new drummers—

Page 21

Al Stewart releases new album and
‘24 Carrots’ is a solid gold record

bass player Robin Lamble, and saxophonist Bryan
Savage.

While making these significant changes Stewart
has kept his tradition of catchy, yet meaningful,
lyrics. In ‘Murmansk Run/Ellis Island,” Stewart
depicts the feelings of new immigrants arriving in
America and accurately portrays their excitement
and sorrow.

The album’s underlying theme incorporated into
each of the nine songs is that of leaving. The
atypical side one begins with ‘Running Man,”
followed by ‘Midnight Rocks”. “Constantinople,”

the third song, is similar thematically to “On The
Border”— from Year of the Cat—in its early war
depiction.

Side two begins with ‘Murmansk Run/Ellis
Island”, which is typical of Stewart’s style. “Op-
tical Illusion,”’ the last cut of the disc, is a likely can-
didate for Stewart’s next single release because of
its short length, excellent orchestration and simple
lyrics.

Although slightly different from his two previous
top-selling albums, Year of the Cat and Time
Passages, 24 Carrots is sure to join them as another

her reflections on Soviet society,
were taken on a tour of the Soviet
Union in October 1979.

Also complementing the ex-
hibit was a lecture Thursday

president of Russian Art Images,

contemporary ‘‘official’’ art of
Russia versus the ‘‘under-
ground” art that has come into
existence in the 20th century.

The Gallery is open daily from
12:30 - 4:30 p.m. and students
should definitely stop by to take
advantage of a fine collection of

Men’s cross country

16th in NCAA race ~

By BOB DAVIS

The men’s cross country team com-
pleted their most successful season ever
by placing 16th place in a field of 29 teams
at the NCAA Championships Nov. 24 in
Wichita, Kansas. This fall, the Bisons won
the ECC Championship for a record sixth
straight year Nov. 8, upset Eastern power
Villanova to win the prestigious IC4A
crown Oct. 20 and extended their dual
meet unbeaten streak to 73 straight over
six seasons. The harriers qualified for the
NCAA Championships with a third place
finish in the Eastern Championships Nov.
15 at Lehigh.

The team topped their 17th place finishes
of both of the last two years but still fell
short of coach Art Gulden’s expectations.
“We should’ve finished around 10th,”
said Gulden. “I thought we were ready — I
didn’t think we’d have problems. We didn’t
have a good meet.”

Team members were also disappointed,
although the squad’s finish was their
highest ever in the NCAA’s. Mark Hulme
83, who placed 91st, commented, ‘‘We all
felt that we were good enough for the top
10.” Bill Reifsnyder °84, who finished
137th, observed, “We ran flat — not up to
par. It was disappointing.”

Texas El Paso easily won the team title
with 58 points, followed by Arkansas with
152 and Penn State with 153. Bucknell
totalled 398 points and as the fourth
Eastern finisher in the race. In addition to
Penn State, Villanova (ninth) and Pro-
vidence (15th) also placed higher than the
Bisons.

Suliman Nyambui of Texas El Paso won
the individual title for the second con-
secutive year with a time of 29 minutes, 4
seconds over the 10,000-meter Echo Hills
Golf Club course. Penn State’s Alan Schar-
su was the first American finisher, placing

seventh in 29:52 in a race that has become
increasingly dominated by foreign
athletes in recent years.

Steve Bigotto ’82 was the first Bucknell
runner to cross the line, managing 81st in
30:45. The remaining Bison runners were
Hulme (91st in 30:49), tri-captain Rick
Sayre ’82 (95th in 30:51), Reifsnyder (137th
in 31:21), tri-captains Mike Debraggio ’81
(162nd in 31:26) and Jim O’Shea (210th in
32:12) and Jeff Hines ’84 (213th in 32:17).

According to Gulden, nagging injuries
that annoyed the team all season ‘‘were of
a magnitude that they affected our per-
formance.” O’Shea raced with a possible
stress fracture of his shin and Reifsnyder
had knee problems, according to Gulden.
Reifsnyder said, “I had a slight strain and
wasn’t mentally prepared as a result,”
and added, ‘‘I went out too slow.”

Several other Bison harriers also started
too slowly, leading Gulden to comment,
“We should’ve been more aggressive, but
that was my fault.” Hulme said, ‘“‘We
might have been a little timid — we should
have gone all out at the start. He said this
was because “‘if you didn’t get out quickly,
you couldn’t make it up. People didn’t die
on the course.”’

Gulden described the Echo Hills course
as relatively flat, a factor that “didn’t
help” the team’s performance. He said,
“We like to run hills — this course wasn’t
demanding.”

Reflecting on the season, Gulden said,
“We've had our most exasperating year
with respect to injuries and sickness. Until
the conference meet, we’d never run our

best team. The resiliency showed was ex-

traordinary — there was always somebody
to fill in.” The coach also noted, ‘‘We have
kids who didn’t make our top seven who
could’ve run in the NCAA’s for another
team.”

and Steve Greenly battle Nov. 18 in an intrasquad wrestle-off for

67 pound weight class. Stoner won the match and opened the season

h at the Bloomsburg Invitationo

with a decisive 13-2 win in the
finals.

Mays was not the only suc-
cessful Bison wrestler as seven of
10 starters finished in the top four
places in their respective weight
classes.

Jim TenBrook ’84, John Stoner
’g2 and Mark Baker ’82 finished
second at 150, 167 and 177 pounds,
respectively. Bill White ’84 finish-
ed third in the 158 pound class as
did Steve Greenly ’82 at 190
pounds. Wally Zimmerman "83
was fourth at 142 pounds and Tim
Pangonas 84 wrestled for fifth
place in the heavyweight divi-
sion.

With their success in such a
competitive tournament, it ap-
pears that the Bisons have a lot of
potential. Ferraro noted, “We
registered more pins than any
other team in the tournament,”
while the freshmen making their
college debut “performed like ex-
perienced wrestlers.” He added,
“We're a young team and we’ll be
getting better as the season goes
on.”

Last season the Bisons had
their first winning record since
1974-75 with a 10-7-1 mark. The
squad also finished fourth in the
ECC tournament.

The wrestlers travel to Penn
State Saturday for a tournament
in which nine of the top 20 teams
in the nation will be competing.
Accordingly, the Bisons “will be
looking more for individual per-
formance,” said Ferraro.

competitors.

Patty Inchalik "81 bested
Dee Raponi of Lewisburg 15-12
in the third game to win the
women’s title. Tracy Milton
"80 who graduated and did not
compete this year, was the
defending champion.

Brian Moran ’83 and Kellyn

and Stacy Bernhard ’83 21-11,
21-18 to win the mixed doubles
title in a field of 15 teams. The
team of Shacknai and Ber-

pions.

sponsor a tournament in
March that will add men’s and
women’s doubles competi-
tions.

Lock Haven women upend Bisons, 63-52

By JEANNE MINAHAN
Disappointing is the only accurate description of the opening con-
test for the women’s basketball team as the Bisons traveled to Lock
Haven Tuesday night and lost to the Eagles, 63-52. In last season’s en-
counter, the Bisons were 73-63 victors when they finished with an 8-10
record.
The problem according to Head Coach Terrie Grieb was ‘‘defense;
we played man-to-man the whole game and they ran on us. We
couldn’t get back on ‘D’.”’
Lock Haven was in foul trouble early in the game but Bucknell
couldn’t capitalize as the squad was six for 22 from the free-throw line.
From the floor, the Bisons’ 37 percent could not match the Eagles’ 49
percent but Bucknell pulled down 37 rebounds to 19 for Lock Haven.
Jill Henry ’81 snared 13 rebounds and Denise Cohen ’83, “‘shot well,
but fouled out with seven minutes to go which hurt us,” according to
Grieb.
Lock Haven dominated the Junior Varsity contest, winning 71-45.
Jeanne Groeneveld ’83 tallied 12 points while Sue Gray ’84 sank six
buckets and pulled down 11 rebounds.
Workouts for the 19-girl team began October 15 and Co-Captain
Henry noted, ‘“‘we have a strong freshmen class, and only one senior
graduated.”
Pete Cautilli is the new junior varsity coach and assistant varsity
coach who “‘has a very good rapport with the girls on the team,”’ ac-
a -| cording to Henry.

Lonnie Fertik ‘83 soars over a hurdle in Tuesda
school records in three individual events (60 yar

the 800 meter relay.

Men’s track favore

By ARTHUR BROCKWAY

Returning the bulk of the team
that won their second straight
ECC indoor championship, who
can possibly be expected to com-
pete with the men’s track team?
Distance runner Mark Hulme ’83
answers that ‘Most of the com-
petition is going to be within our
own team rather than within our
conference.”

Having already won the ECC
cross country championship this
fall, the Bisons begin their quest
for the second leg of the ECC tri-
ple crown, the indoor season,
when they host an open meet at
noon Saturday in the
Sports/Recreation Complex.

Coach Art Gulden offers op-
ponents the chilling thoughts,
“We'll be deeper just about
everywhere than we’ve been in
the past. We can score in every
event.”

The Bisons feature their most
talent in the distance events
where competitors from the cross
country team, 16th place
finishers in the NCAA Champion-
ships, will be concentrated. For

instance, in last year’s ECC race,
Rick Sayre 82 , Jim O’Shea ’81
and Bob Murdock ’83 placed one-
two-three at three miles and are
all looking for more of the same
success. Bucknell runners also
took three of the top six positions
in the one mile race and four of
the top six at two miles in the
ECC Championships.

Gulden’s forces in the field
events will be stronger than ever.
Middle distance runner Tom
Madigan notes, ‘“‘The field events
are going to be a lot stronger than
they have been in the last few
years. They’re going to surprise a
lot of people.”

Sophomore Ted Lewis returns
with the school high jump record
of six-foot-eight (and seven feet
in practice) in his possession.
Pole vaulter Dave Keller was
fourth in the conference meet
while Kris Coghlan ’81 and Jim
Passannante ’82 were sixth in the
triple jump and shot put, respec-
tively.

Sprinter Martin Carter "83, who
tied the school record for the 100
yard dash outdoors, will provide

doors.

Among the top middle distance
runners and hurdlers are
Madigan and Gary Thompson 82.
Madigan was fifth at 880 yards in
the ECC after placing third as a
freshman. Madigan predicted, ‘‘I
could be right there as a con-
tender as long as there aren’t a
lot of injuries (to myself) and no
other other problems.”’ Thomp-
son was fifth in last year’s 60 yard
high hurdles conference race.

Hulme sums up the sentiments
of most team members, saying,
“T think this year we'll really
clean up in the conference.”

Trackwomen open
today in home meet

Many University record-holders return

By LISA CERUTI
The women’s indoor track team, coming off a 4-1 dual meet
record, opens its season at 4 p.m. today in the Sports/Recreation com-
plex when they host the Bucknell Invitational. Temple and Maryland
are the top competitors in the 10 team field — but there will be no team
scoring.

Coach Diane Ware said the meet will be a chance for “individuals
to find out what their times are.”
The Bisons, with 13 freshmen and 11 sophomores on a roster of 33,

return a squad that established many new University indoor records
last winter.

Co-captains Linda Accettura and Suzanne Hecker give the team
strength at the middle distance race. Accettura, who set the Universi-
ty 440 yard mark of 1:01.5 last year and also holds the 50 yard dash
record, will run in the two mile relay with freshmen Karen Flanagan,
Debbie Passmore and Judy Olson. Hecker holds the 220 yard and 400
meter school records and will run the 440 yard dash and compete in the
880 yard relay with Mara Debraggio 82, Laurie VanWyck ’83 and Nan-
cy Russo ’84.

VanWyck, running in the 60 yard hurdles and 880 yard relay today,
will be striving for another record - breaking season. In the outdoor
season last spring, VanWyck broke University and Memorial Stadium
records in the 440 yard hurdles.

Lonnie Fertik ’83, holder of school records in the 60 yard dash, 55
meter hurdles and high jump, is expected to score well throughout the
season. Although bothered by ankle problems, Fertik is slated to com-
pete in the long jump, high jump, shot put and 60 yard hurdles today.

Lisa Kretz ’81 holds the school long jump record of 15-8%4 and will
also compete in the high jump. Beth Bittel ’83, who set the University

shot put record at 43¥% last winter, will throw the shot along with Fer-
tik and Michelle Brown ’81.

understandable.”

Okorodudu commented, “It
(the loss) taught us a lot about
ourselves. We know we have to
work really hard every night.”
Leslie said, “It was a new ex-
perience for all of us’’ and ‘“‘We
picked up a little more con-
fidence.”

Lafayette, 44-40 losers to
Virginia Commonwealth in their
opening match up provided the
competition in the contest for
third place. The Leopards shared
the East Coast Conference West
Division title with Bucknell last
year and were selected over the
Bisons to compete in the NIT by
virtue of a season-ending 92-79
win over Bucknell.

Lafayette’s patient offense and
tenacious one-three-one defense
gave them an early lead which
they expanded to 34-21 at
halftime. The tenacity the Bisons
showed against Virginia had
greatly diminished. Woollum
said, ‘“How can you not be up for
Lafayette?”

According to the Bison coach,
the-turning point of the half came
when the Leopards gained a 17-16
advantage. ‘Emotionally, we
had a letdown at this point. We
shot the ball atrociously.’’ In-
deed, Bucknell hit only 17 percent
(four of 24) of their first half at-
tempts while Lafayette shot at a
48 percent clip.

In the second half, cold
shooting continued to plague the
Bisons. Leslie, the team’s leading
scorer in 13 of 27 games last year,
made only one field goal (a

McDonald named to
All-American team

Four players from the 6-4 Bucknell football team, the winningest
squad since 1972’s 5-4 team, received post season honors this week.

Mike McDonald ’80 was selected to the University Division I-AA
Kodak All-American team at offensive tackle by the American Foot-
ball Writers Association. McDonald, a dean’s list student who cap-
tained the Bisons in 1979, was the dominant force in the offensive line
all year and has been heavily scouted by NFL teams.

Halfback Ken Jenkins ’82 failed to make the team despite leading
NCAA Division I-AA in scoring with 96 points and all-purpose running
with 188.4 yards per game. Jenkins also set an NCAA division record
with 1,884 all-purpose running yards and shattered school season
records with 213 rushing attempts, 1,270 rushing yards and 16
touchdowns.

The three running backs selected were seniors Frank Hawkins of
Nevada-Reno (the nation’s leading rusher), Lorenzo Bouier of Maine
(the second leading rusher) and Joe Delaney of Northwest Louisiana
(fifth in rushing yardage). Jenkins was the fourth leading rusher in
the nation and was far ahead of Delaney in both scoring and all-
purpose yards. ae

Jenkins, however, was named to the ECAC Division I-AA team
along with defensive back McKinley Norris ’81. Tri-captain Joe
Catalano ’81 was an honorable mention pick at linebacker while
McDonald, amazingly, was left completely off the team. The 10 ECAC
I-AA head coaches chose a single 30-man squad, including ties.

Norris tied for the tearn lead with four interceptions and made 43
tackles this season. Catalano led the squad in tackles with 137 and
totalled 360 for his career as he earned three varsity letters.

we were going to win ” Bucknell continued to apply pressure In the se-
cond quarter but Santa Barbara found the net three times to two for
the Bisons to close the gap to 6-9 at halftime

Santa Barbara retook the lead in the third quarter with a pait of
goals because ‘‘they started to go to their bench more” noted Schulte
Bucknell still had a chance to win the contest as the final quarter
began

Unfortunately, a victory was not in the cards for the Bisons and San
ta Barbara scored two late goals to emerge victorious, 10-8. Weiman
said, ‘‘Toward the end of the game the breaks started to go their way”
and added, ‘‘When we got ahead we still played as hard as we could.”
He further said, “It was a big ¢ isappointment to lose but we showed a
lot of people we could play w ith them.”

Schulte again led the team in scoring, notching three goals, while
Weiman and Mark Gensheimer "81 added two apiece and Corl one
Weiman remarked, ‘Everyone contributed, scoring oF not,” adding

With a few breaks we could have beaten them * Schulte agreed
noting, ‘We played as best we could. The game could have gone either
way

All their wishes to defeat a California team dashed, the team
regrouped for a showdown with Loyola of Chicago for seventh place.
The Bisons owned a 12-9 win over Loyola Nov. 16 in the finals of the
Eastern Championships and also tied Loyola 3-3 Nov. 2 in the AAU Na-
tionals. In last year’s NCAA tournament, the Bisons toppled I ,oyola 9-5
for fifth place

Bucknell ‘played really w ell the whole game” according to Paxton
but only had a 2-1 halftime advantage. In the second half, though, the
Bisons began to show their dominance by scoring a trio of goals in both
of the final two quarters to emerge with an 8-4 victory

Weiman said, ‘Everyone got it together one last time”’ and being
one of six seniors on the squad, noted, “Tt was really good to go out
with a win.”

The leading scorer was Schulte who tallied six times in nine shots
Schulte’s 12 goals for the tournament tied him with Kevin Robertson of
California-Berkeley for high scorer, the fourth straight year Schulte
has either tied for or been the outright scoring leader.

Schulte ended his outstanding career with a record 50 goals in NCAA
Championships, smashing the old mark of 38. In addition, his 586 goals
in four varsity seasons is another national record.

Four days after making his final appearance for Bucknell, Schulte
said, “It really hasn’t hit me yet.” On his Bucknell career, he com-
mented, “I’m proud of what the team did and I’m pleased with what I
did individually.”

The Bisons were 114-15-3 in Schulte’s four years and finished
seventh, sixth, fifth and seventh in the NCAA. Schulte has twice been
named to the AAU All-American first team, set a school record with 11
goals in one game and scored five or more goals in 62 of his 132 games
for Bucknell.

After the final horn sounded to give the Bi. « s seventh place in the
nation, Weiman recalls ‘standing there and saying ‘This is it?’ Weall
went back into the pool and played polo (among ourselves) since there
wasn’t a game after us.”

Olson finishes 79th
in ALAW Nationals

Freshman Judy Olson garnered
a 79th place finish in the AIAW
National Cross Country Cham-
pionship Nov. 15 in Seattle. Olson,
the first Bucknell freshman ever
to qualify for the AIAW Cham-
pionship race, covered the 5,000
meter Tyee Valley Golf Club
course in 19 minutes, 33 seconds,
her fastest 5,000 meter time ever.

In a field of 170 competitors in
the race hosted by Washington
University, Idaho’s Patsy
Sharples was the first place
finisher, completing the course in
17:44. South Dakota State cap-
tured the team championship
with 82 points followed by Seattle
Pacific with 99.

Bucknell did not qualify for the
National championship because
of a sixth place team finish in the
EAIAW Division II qualifying
race Nov. 1 at Indiana, Pa. Only
the top three teams from the
Eastern championship qualified
for the National finals.

Olson was the lone Bison runner

oo

to qualify for the AIAW cham
pionship race as a result of her
14th place time of 19:35 in the
Eastern championship. In the
cross country team’s five meets
prior to the Eastern champion-
ship, Olson never finished higher
than second among Bison run-
ners. Jo Burrell ’83 was the first
Bucknell finisher in every meet
except for the Eastern champion-
ship where she ended up 34th in
20:18, missing a spot among the
top 15 qualifying for the National
championship.

Olson, who attended the race
only with coach Diane Ware, had
“no idea what to expect’’ before
the race but said, ‘‘I just wanted
to come in before the 150th per-
son.’’ She commented,
“Strategically, I didn’t run a real
good race. I didn’t go out fast
enough.” Olson “‘felt relieved”
after finishing so high against the
top female collegiate runners in
the country, concluding, “It was
a completely new experience.”

Bisons are fourth
in Virginia tourney

By DAVE KIRKPATRICK
and JEFF CROSS

CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. —
The Breakin’ Bisons opened their
regular season with a pair of
losses at the Virginia Tipoff
Classic here last weekend, losing
to host Virginia, the eventual
tournament champions, 64-45 Fri-
day night and 69-47 to Lafayette
in Saturday night’s consolation
game.

Coming off a 24-10 season last
year and a first place finish in the
National Invitational Tourna-
ment, Virginia was ranked as
high as fifth nationally in
preseason polls. The Cavaliers’
starting five includes seven-foot-
four sophomore center Ralph
Sampson, called by Bucknell
Head Coach Charlie Woollum
“the greatest to play the game at
this stage of his career,”’ and six-
foot-six senior guard Jeff Lamp
who was the leading scorer in the
rugged Atlantic Coast Con-
ference two years ago.

Of the imposing Virginia
squad, Bison center Deb
Okorodudu ’82 said, ‘‘None of our
players were intimidated. The
pressure was on them.’”’ Team
captain Al Leslie ’81 noted, “We
weren’t intimidated. We were
more afraid to play badly.”

Despite playing opposite the
most highly regarded collegiate
center since perennial National
Basketball Association all-star
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,
Okorodudu said, “I was really
caught up in the emotion of the
game and I wasn’t nervous. I
knew I had to play physical
(against Sampson).”’

To combat the size disad-
vantage throughout the Bucknell
lineup, Woollum decided to
employ a tightly packed two-
three zone defense. Okorodudu,
in giving up nine inches to Samp-
son, said, ‘‘We knew we had to go
out there and hustle, play good
defense and not let Sampson get

too many shots.”

Leslie got the Bisons off to a
surprising 6-0 lead by canning
two outside jumpers and then
scoring on a lay-up after making
the first of his six steals for the
contest. However, the Cavaliers
reeled off eight unanswered
points to take a lead they would
never relinquish.

The inexperienced Bisons did
not collapse, though, and scrap-
ped furiously on defense to keep
the halftime deficit to 29-18.
Bucknell actually outrebounded
Virginia 15-10 for the half. Ray
Moss ’83 had five of the Bison re-
bounds and provided the most
spectacular offensive move of the
half when he performed a reverse
slam dunk over Sampson with
five minutes left.

The Cavaliers could not shake
Bucknell and the Bisons crept to
within 10 points midway through
the final 20 minutes. At this point,
though, Sampson snared a re-
bound, fired an outlet pass to
playmaking guard Jeff Jones,
hustled to the Virginia end and
converted Jones’ return pass into
a slam dunk. Virginia then pulled
away, building their lead to 24
points at one juncture and time
expired with the Cavaliers com-
fortably ahead, 64-45.

Leslie was the game’s leading
scorer with 20 points while Samp-
son and Lamp both had 16 for
Virginia. Sampson also had eight
rebounds ard three blocked
shots, both game highs.

Woollum sitid, “Virginia is a
far superior team to us’”’ but, ‘we
made a good effort, especially on
defense.”’

The Bisons hit on only 35 per-
cent of their shots and ‘The of-
fensive flow was poor” remarked
Woollum, ‘‘But it (better
cohesiveness) takes a lot of ex-
perience (playing together).’”’ He
added, ‘We still have a lot of
work to do to function as an offen-

Water polo finishes seventh in NCAA to‘earn respect’

or

By JEFF CROSS

Like Sisyphus trying to push a boulder up a hill in Hades, the water
polo team has spent each of the last four years trying to break the
stronghold of California teams on the national championship trophy.
To become NCAA champions, the Bisons not only had to win the
Eastern Championship, which they did for the fourth straight year,
but also upset a California team in the first round of the national cham-
pionships.

Although they gave every ounce of their strength, the Bisons were

= once again dealt a first round defeat and they went on to finish seventh
* of eight teams in the NCAA Championships last weekend in Long

Beach, Ca.

The seventh-seeded Bisons took their 30-2-2 regular season record in-
to their opening game at noon, Saturday against second-seeded
California-Irvine realizing that Irvine ‘“‘was out of our league’”’ ac-

, cording to Captain Scott Schulte ’81. Despite playing such a vaunted
; squad, the Bisons scored at an even pace with Irvine in the second

quarter to trail by only 5-3 at halftime.

Irvine’s bench strength began to take a toll in the second half,
however, and Bucknell was outcored 8-1 in the half to bring the final

back Saturday night to face the defending national champions,

New ABS President Michael Suarez ‘82 (right) gives the oath
of office at Monday night's ABS Congress meeting to fellow
steering committee members Missy Campbell ‘82 and Lon
Castle ‘83.

Suarez takes the oath;
drastic change proposed

By DAVID GROSSMAN

Michael Suarez ’82 was sworn in as president of the Association of
Bucknell Students Monday night, pledging in his inaugural address
to “radically improve the effectiveness of the ABS Congress.”

Suarez concentrated on his urge to redirect the ABS’ function
from “a largely discussive body primarily concerned with policy
and proposals’’ to ‘‘a more active Congress, where the primary em-
phasis is placed upon programs for students.”

While downplaying the importance of committee work, Suarez in-
troduced the concept of a team structure to the Congress. Suarez
said “each team is responsible for gathering information and ideas,
establishing contacts and making recommendations to the Con-
gress.”

The team, composed of two people, is to act as both a “task
force’’ that investigates issues and makes these recommendations,
and as a liaison between the Congress, the existing committees, and
the administration, Suarez said.

Another important change that will be implemented in the Con-
gress is the structure, frequency and location of meetings. Suarez
said “most often our meetings will not be deliberations, but will
rather be working, problem-solving sessions.” Suarez attributed this
change to the increased amount of investigative work that must be

Study on expansion of

UC’s third floor begun

By CINDY CROSSLEY

A study to determine the cost
of completing the third floor of
the University Center and to
create additional dining space
adjacent to the Buttery rooms
has been commissioned by the
University using the UC’s
original architect and engineer.

Vice President for Administra-
tion and Finance John Zeller
said the study — part of an
overall review of space current-
ly being conducted by the
University — is preliminary and
that the University has no plans
at this time to proceed with any
recommendations made by Ar-
chitect Nils Larson, of Larson
and Larson, and Engineer Louis
Bouvier, of Louis Bouvier and
Associates, both of Winston-
Salem, N.C.

“We have no money for this,”’
Zeller said, referring to the
University’s plans for following
through with the proposals.
Depending on the results of the
study, a recommendation could

be made to the University Board
of Trustees as early as May,
Zeller said. He said he expects
those results in about six weeks.

Zeller said the study is based
on a plan that calls for the top
floor of the center to be finished
with a museum, a lounge and
two other rooms, one of which is
designated for student activities.

The plan also incorporates
adding another room above the
main dining service kitchen and
adjacent to the Buttery dining
rooms.

According to Zeller, this would
mean the windows in the But-
tery rooms would be lost. Access
to the new room would be gain-
ed through the present lobby of
the Refectory and Buttery room
241-D.

ing addition is envisioned as a
glass-enclosed room with metal
roofing. According to Dining
Service Director Henry Ross,
this would allow for a passive
solar heating system, making
use of what he called a “decent
amount of sunlight’ received by
that side of the building.

Inside, the room would seat
between 200 and 300 people in
4,000 square feet of space.

Both Ross and Zeller des-
cribed the room as a sort of
“multi-purpose” room. At lunch-
time, the room could be used to
relieve the pressure on the
Bostwick cafeteria, serving a
limited menu of soup anid salad.
Ross said the meals would be
served from portable equipment
that could be rolled away and
stored at night. Then the room
would be used for receptions or
other social functions, such as
Christy’s Gate.

When Larson and Bouvier
were on campus in January,

Thornburgh speaks on education aide

a

GOV. DICK THORNBURGH

By DAVID HAWKINGS

HARRISBURG — Pennsylvania Gov.
Dick Thornburgh renewed his promise
Jan. 23 to make improvement of higher
education in the state one of his ad-
ministration’s top priorities, but he
refrained from making any strong fiscal
commitment to private colleges and
universities.

Thornburgh said he believed the state
should have “‘minimal interference”’ in the
operation of private institutions like
Bucknell, but he said state public, semi-
public and private schools would continue
to receive government aid, especially at
places where “programs of particular in-
terest to the state’ are involved.

Speaking to a group of 35 college
newspaper editors at an afternoon news
conference in the Governor’s Mansion
here, the governor said virtually all aid to

private colleges would come in the form of
additional spending in the Institutional Aid
Grants program and the Pennsylvania
Higher Education Assistance Agency, two
programs that offer financial aid to keep
students in Pennsylvania based colleges.

The governor pledged to increase the
level of funding as he has in each year of
his administration for the PHEEA, but he
said funds were not currently available to
raise the income ceiling on the Institu-
tional Aid Grants — now set at $25,000 —
because ‘‘when you raise the ceiling you
cut down the size of each piece of pie.”

The sole way to increase the amount of
aid to private colleges, Thornburgh said,
would be to give these #wo assistance
organizations the extra money the state
would save through the creation of a Com-
monwealth University system—a system
he has pushed for since his gubernatorial

campaign of 1978.

The Commonwealth system would
enable the state educational systert to
benefit from what the governor called “‘the
economies of scale” in purchasing educa-
tional and other supplies for state schools
and would provide a tighter control of their
curricula.

A bill to establish the system is now
before the legislature and has “‘a pretty
good chance of passage,” Thornburgh
said.

On a topic unrelated to education and aid
to schools — the issues which monopolized
questioning during the 90-minute session
— Thornburgh reiterated his support for
lowering the drinking age in the state, but
he said it would be ‘‘very unlikely the
legislature would respond differently than
they did two years ago”’ to a bill that would
reduce the age to 18.

Faculty approv

By LYDIA HIGGINSON

The University faculty approved a motion Dec. 15 to
include the Fall Break in next year’s calendar after a
debate which lasted through two of the days in the
body’s four day meeting.

The approved Fall Break will begin at 5:45 p.m., Fri-
day, Oct. 30 and will end at8a.m., Wednesday, Nov. 4.

The faculty meeting opened with the consideration of
an amendment proposed by Professor of Chemistry
Hans Veening, which called for adding two days
elsewhere in the term to make up for the time lost due
to the break. University Committee on Instruction
Chairman Joseph LaBarge said opening the semester
two days early would cause other serious difficulties,

and that adding the days at the end of the term would
virtually abolish the reading period. .

After discussing the possibility of making up the lost
days on weekends, the faculty defeated Veening’s
amendment.

Several faculty members expressed concern about the
scheduling of the recess. Professor and Head of Modern
Languages Allan Grundstrom asked why the break fell
eight weeks into the semester instead of in the middle.
The recess could not occur earlier since Homecoming
Weekend is scheduled for Friday, Oct. 23 through Sun-
day, Oct. 25 and could not be changed, LaBarge said.

LaBarge’s motion to include the Fall Break in next
semester’s calendar was then passed. After this fall’s

es Fall Break for 1981

recess, the faculty intends to discuss its “effects” and
later determine whether to continue the break.

Last fall’s break was closely watched by faculty and
administration, and informal observations by Dean of
Student Affairs John Dunlop and Dean of the College of
Engineering Barry Maxwell indicated that there was
“no significant difference” in class attendance in the
days before the break.

When the faculty originally voted in November 1979 to
schedule a mid-term recess, certain conditions were set
for its continuation. These include “‘normal’’ class atten-
dance by students and faculty members on the days im-
mediately preceding and following the break.

Trustees to meet on Thursday;

$1100 tuition hike is planned

By BILL THUM

The University Committee on
Planning and Budget voted
Wednesday to recommend a 15.2
percent, $1100 increase in tuition
and fees for next year to the Ex-
ecutive Committee of the Univer-
sity Board of Trustees.

If accepted by the executive
committee — which will meet in
New York City Thursday —
Bucknell’s comprehensive
charges would increase from
$7321 to $8431, with wage and
salary increases amounting to 9.5
percent across the board and an
additional 5 percent for merit,
structural and equity compensa-
tion, according to the 12th alter-
nate to the budget prepared by
the committee.

Vice President for Administra-
tion and Finance John Zeller
reported to the committee the
results of the informal surveys on
which the proposal is based. In a
study by University President
Dennis O’Brien, the average in-
crease of salaries among faculty
at Bucknell’s 17 frame of
reference schools was 12.1 per-
cent in 1980-81

Bucknell’s increase amounted
to only 7.96 percent, far behind
these other schools, Zeller said.

It is due to this difference that
the faculty has pressured the
committee to include a 2 percent
catch-up item in addition to the

(PES
Arrival of new computer expected
as construction lags behind schedule

By STEVE GARFINKEL
Although the Computer Center is ready for the
arrival of the new Honeywell computer, the con-
struction of the building is still behind schedule,
according to Physical Plant Director John Bell.

Bell said the basement floor of the building is
three weeks behind schedule and the top two
floors are two weeks behind. The delays were
caused by the late arrival of the tinted glass which
encircles the top of thie building. 4

Construction workers were not able to perform
certain plastering jobs since heat could not be con-
tained within the building without the glass, Bell
said.

According to Vice President for Administration
and Finance John Zeller, all cost estimates in-
dicate the center is within the budget. Bell con-
firmed this observation but added that all
estimates of costs cannot be accurately tabulated
until after the building is completed.

Elmer Ritter of Ritter Bros., the general con-
tractors for the $1.3 million building said, ‘The
second floor is 99 percent complete.”

Director of Computer Activities Jon Eschinger
estimated the transition to the new computer

system will take one year and cost between
$300,000 and $350,000.

The Honeywell DPS — which will replace the
present Xerox Sigma 7 — was shipped from
Phoenix, Arizona today and will arrive within ten
days, Zeller said. The new computer will be on the
second floor of the Center.

Costs for the entire project exceed $3 million.
The computer system alone claims $1 million of
the budget, with conversion and transition costs
expected to reach $300,000. The new building and
its furnishings are expected to cost $1.3 million.

The top two floors of the building will not be
opened for use before next semester, because the
new computer will not be operable until then,
Zeller said.

Included in the computer center project is the
remodeling of the Dana Engineering building.
Renovations are expected to cost close to $250,000.
The most costly item is a $135,000 sprinkler
system to be installed during the summer of 1982.

Four engineering labs have also been ear-
marked to receive $200,000 worth of new equip-
ment.

12.2 percent increase projected
by these other schools, Zeller
said.

In a survey prepared by Col-
gate University of a slightly more
prestigious group of institutions,
Bucknell’s ranking fell from sixth
in 1979-80 to tenth in 1980-81 out of
12 in average faculty compensa-
tion. Bucknell is currently more
than $1100 below the average for
the group. In addition to the ine-
quities in faculty compensation,
the administration, staff and
physical plant are faced with an
increase in the consumer price
index of 13.3 percent for 1979 and
12.4 percent for 1980, Zeller said.

Chairman of the University
Committee on Planning and
Budget Stephen Becker said the
proposal fell short of the faculty’s
call for a 15 percent wage in-
crease and ‘“‘doesn’t begin to cor-
rect the inequities of the current
year.” Also, although faculty will
receive a 14.5 percent increase,
most non-academic staff will
gain a 9.5 percent increase in ad-
dition to the 1.5 percent already
determined in December. Light
construction workers and
foremen will receive an addi-
tional 1 percent in structural and
equity increments for a total of 12
percent, Zeller said.

ABS President Michael Suarez
’82 said although he knows infla-
tion is high, the board of trustees

“must be sensitive to the fact that
students cannot tolerate a series
of $1100 increases.” In this light,
Suarez said he will follow the
recommendations of the ABS
Committee on Finance and sug-
gest that the board increase the
percentage of endowment income
used to offset the budget from 5 to
6 percent.

He will also ‘‘urge the Trustees
to investigate alternate sources
of income to the University, par-
ticularly in light of President
Reagan’s plans to cut aid to
universities,” he said.

Suarez also plans to call for an
increase of $4 to $6 in the Student
Activities fee. This would be used
to provide ‘‘better programs and
more social alternatives,”’
Suarez said.

In an interview, one trustee ex-
ecutive committee member said
“The decision is a difficult one. In
addition to the need of maintain-
ing academic excellence, there is
the need to keep the cost of educa-
tion at a level where not only the
upper-crust can afford it.

“Alsg,”’ the trustee — who ask-
ed for anonymity — said
“although the C.P.I. is presently
extremely high, by ad-
ministratively raising prices
along with inflation, continued in-
flation at a similar level is the in-
evitable result.”

not yet been decided which
faculty offices will be moved in-
to Marts.

The proposal for the move was
created by the President’s Staff,
a committee comprised of eight
University administrators and
headed by University President
Dennis O’Brien. The committee
considered numerous alter-
natives to provide more office
space but concluded that moving
University Relations was the
most feasible solution.

Other possibilities the Presi-
dent’s Staff explored included
moving an academic depart-
ment from Coleman Hall to the
C.S.I.U. building or using it to
house the Office of Admissions.
Another option was to convert
the building into a residence
house and use another residence
facility for the needed. office
space.

The intended location of
University Relations offices will
prevent easy access to the
President’s office and the

Director of Deferred Giving
Fitz R. Walling said ‘‘There are
advantages and disadvantages
to the move, but there is
definitely a need for more
space.”

According to~ Walling, the
C.S.I.U. building, a white Vic-

not been officially approved yet,
Zeller said that if it is approved,
the relocation should be com-

Certain renovations are
planned for the building in order
to maximize the available
space, Walling said. The most
extensive changes will be made
on the third floor, which needs
to be altered in order to comply
with fire regulations.

An estimate of remodeling

mined, Zeller said.

The lunchtime crowding in the University Center's dining hall has prompted Unive

Traffic flow study conducted

to ease congestion during lunch

By MATT KARANIAN

The cafeteria is poorly arranged and ‘‘people just aren’t efficient
when they’re going through there,” so Dave Christiansen 81 is con-
ducting a traffic flow study of the cafeteria to help reduce the conges-
tion during lunches.

Christiansen said he and Chip Douglas ’81 hope to come up with
“potential solutions” to what they consider to be a “complex’’ pro-
blem of over-crowding and inefficiency during lunch between 11:50
a.m. and 12:15 p.m.

It is estimated that 50 percent of meal ticket holders eat lunch dur-
ing this peak time, Christiansen said.

Although the cafeteria could conceivably handle this inflow of

traffic, Christiansen said it is not properly designed to do so.

to commission the UC’s original architects to make preliminary plans for an additional dining
room above the kitchens. The architect is also studying ways to divide the space on the build-

ing's third floor.

New changes proposed for UC

From NEW CHANGES, page 1.

some consideration was given to putting
the additional dining room up on the top floor of
the UC — as recommended in an ABS proposal —
according to Ross. That idea was rejected, Ross
said, because it was too far removed from the din-
ing service and would require an additional
holding area for food preparation.

Ross said the men felt an additional dining room
would be much easier to service from the Buttery.

There would be no problem with the addition in
terms of the underlying structural support, Ross
said, because the roof over the kitchen was
designed to support future additions.

The space recommended by the ABS for an ad-
ditional dining area is now planned for a museum.
Covering 5,500 square feet, the museum would in-
corporate the Kress Collection, presently housed
on the second floor of the Bertrand Library; the
exhibitions held in the Center Gallery; pieces
from the permanent collection, and student work,
according to Zeller.

The space presently occupied by the Center
Gallery would be turned into a lounge to make use
of the view, Zeller said. The two remaining rooms
on the top floor both offer 1,800 square feet of
space. One is proposed as a room for student ac-
tivities. Zeller did not indicate that any plans exist
for use of the other room.

Zeller said that University has been doing a
space review for some time now, because there
are needs in a number of departments. He said
the University has asked the Central Susquehanna
Intermediate Unit to vacate the University proper-
ty it presently occupies at 82 University Avenue.

(See story p.4) The University has also requested
the Federal Reserve Board to vacate the space it
occupies in the basement of Roberts Hall by this
summer.

“The space is more valuable to us now than the
income from renting it,” Zeller said. Still, the
University’s needs are greater than these spaces
satisfy and therefore a study was commissioned to
assess expansion and use of existing buildings,
Zeller said.

The study was also prompted by the ABS pro-
posal for development and use of the third floor,
he said. This proposal was adopted by the ABS in
November and presented to University President
Dennis O’Brien and the Board of Trustees in
December. Many of the recommendations of the
present proposal follow the ABS proposal, with the
exception of the addition to the dining area.

Although he declined to give an official L iiver-
sity ranking of priorities in space needs, Zeller
said dining space “ranked high” on his priority
list. He added that office space for administration
and faculty was also very necessary.

Ross said that the seating problem in the
cafeteria pointed to a more central problem with
space in the UC.

“J don’t think that anyone envisioned that the
UC would be used this much,” Ross said. “The
dining room was designed for 2,000 people on meal
plans. We’re feeding 300 more than that. With 823
seats, we have a turnover problem, mostly at
lunchtime and Sunday dinners. We can increase
our productivity but seating will still be our big-
gest problem.”

rsity officials

Because of this, the present “scramble method” of getting one’s
meal must be re-examined as well as student attitudes. Part of the
problem is the “system” and “part is people,” Christiansen said.
Christiansen hopes to make recommendations to Dining Service
Director Henry Ross to help make the system more efficient.

He and Douglas have submitted a traffic flow study to Associate
Professor of Civil Engineering Richard McGinnis as part of a senior
project and will continue their research this semester.

They also plan to initiate a student ‘campaign’ to encourage effi-
cient use of the cafeteria.

Don Blum ‘84 gives his sales pitch for the Bison Bargain book to Lisa McComsey ‘81 in the mall
of the University Center last week. Blum is selling the book — his own creation — to Univer-
sity students for $3 in order to make some extra spending money.

Student sells ‘Bison Bargain Books’

By TRICIA KENNEDY
With the help of 37 local mer-
chants, an enterprising freshman
has devised a unique way to earn
extra cash and help other
students save money.

Donald Blum ’84 was searching
for a Jan plan to complement his
management major when he
read an article in a Philadelphia
newspaper about books of locally
redeemable coupons being sold at
the University of Pennsylvania.

During January, Blum took the
idea — along with a copy of the
Penn coupon book — to
Lewisburg merchants. A total of
37-store owners signed contracts

to include an item in the circular.
The collection of coupons is call-
ed “Bison Bargain Book’’ and
sells for $3.

Blum has sold 200 out of 500
printed copies since Feb. 2 and is
“about breaking even.’’ He at-
tributes the limited success of his
venture to a lack of student
awareness of how much he said
they could save by using the
coupon book.

“You could probably save about
$100 if you used all 51 coupons,
and even if you used only two or
three, you could recover the cost
of the book,’’ Blum said.

Blum sells the bargain books by

sitting at a table in the UC mall.
He originally intended to sell the
circular through the University
bookstore but was not permitted
to according to Vice President for
Administration and Finance John
Zeller.

“The University doesn’t want to
have to guarantee that coupons
are honored,’ Zeller said.
“Students may solicit in the UC
and residence halls if they have
permission,’’ he added.

Although ‘Bison Bargain
Books” will be sold throughout
the semester, Blum said he will
not continue to sit in the Universi-
ty Center.

Phon-A-Thon called success despite

less than record alumni support

By ROBIN MEREDITH

Although the total of $163,071
pledged to Bucknell’s Annual
Fund during this January’s
Phon-A-Thon fell short of last
year’s record, Director of An-
nual Giving William Torrey has
pronounced this year’s results
the best in Phon-A-Thon history.

While more than $166,000 was
pledged in last year’s drive,
many difficulties worked against
this year’s steering committee
in their effort to break the
record Torrey said. Student
Chairman Mary Gibbons ’82 said
that in addition to having one
less night of calling, there were
two other regional Phon-A-Thons
earlier in the year and the 25th
Reunion Class was not con-
tacted. ‘This is a group known

for its support,” Gibbons said.

Despite these difficulties, 30
volunteer students called more
than 30,000 alumni each night
for 20 nights to raise pledges
nearly equal to last year’s ef-
fort, Gibbons said.

The students — instructed by
a steering committee of Patti
Koch ’83, Pam Ecock ’82, Tom
Cummings ’81, Nick Spennato
81 and Sue Willis ’82 — were
provided with information on the
people they called and prizes
were awarded to the most suc-
cessful callers as an incentive,
Gibbons said.

In a month-long contest, Anne
Kalin ’84 gained the most new
donors and Laura Callahan ’83
raised the most new money.

The Phon-A-Thon represents a

direct follow-up to a mailing on
the Annual Fund that was sent
to all Bucknell graduates in Oc-
tober. The Annual Fund differs
from other donation categories
in that its funds are not targeted
for specific projects but are in-
stead used where they are most
needed during the current
academic year.

Associate Director of Annual
Giving Robert Kalfin said
“Much of the success of this
year’s Phon-A-Thon must be at-
tributed to the cohesiveness of
the steering committee in
motivating the callers.”

“Many alumni look forward to
those January calls; for the ma-
jority this is their only contact
with Bucknell during the year,”
Torrey said.

Faculty limits night classes

By SUSAN MACDONALD

In a move to decrease the number of extra-
curricular conflicts with night courses and exams,
the faculty — in their December 17 meeting — ac-
cepted the University Committee on Instruction’s
proposal that restricts night courses to Monday,
Wednesday and Thursday nights.

University Provost Wendell Smith said that in
addition to allowing time for cultural events, ‘The
committee was moved to its action by a desire to
take into account the position of students in a situa-
tion that is near anarchy.” There is considerable
“underground” scheduling, he asserted, and
therefore some limitation is needed.

Chairman of the Committee on Instruction
Joseph La Barge said that the measure “will also
provide a better sense of predictability and
regularity for both faculty and students. Although
the plan restricts the holding of classes on Tuesday
nights, exceptions could be granted by the Dean of
the appropriate college, La Barge said. The resolu-
tion will go into effect in the Fall of 1981.

In addition to this proposal, the faculty also
decided to restrict exams held beyond the regularly
scheduled classes. La Barge — also head and
associate professor of religion — said the idea was

that students must be forewarned that an exam
would be held outside of the regularly scheduled
classes. In this light, if there is a possibility of ex-
ams occurring outside of the regularly scheduled
time, it must be listed in the class description in the
course guide, La Barge said.

This problem was especially acute in classes
with multiple sections, like Biology, he said. Since
theprofessor’s preference is to give one. common ex:
am, he added, if a student has a conflict, it would en-
tail dropping another obligation or taking a make-
up exam. /

This puts the student in a very awkward posi-
tion, La Barge said.

Michael Kaye ’82, student member of the Com-
mittee, said the new policy could still cause many
problems with class scheduling. “Scheduling would
be very difficult if classes had to be selected around
specific exam times,” Kaye said.

La Barge said this problem could be avoided by
not listing the times of the exams in the course
descriptions, but instead,only if there werejto be
outside exams. Once students were enrolled, the
computer could be used to determine times that
would not present conflicts, La Barge said.

By MATT KARANIAN

A woman has been hired to fill
a vacancy on the previously all-

result of an opening created in
the department when Chief of
Security Norman Fine retired
Dec. 31.

Donna Digin of Lewisburg was
hired to fill the slot vacated by

he assumed the position of Acting

The University is expected to
find a permanent replacement
for Fine sometime ‘‘within the
next three months,” according to
Vice President for Administra-
tion and Finance John Zeller, at
which time Amarante will
resume his position as
patrolman. Zeller said Digin will
retain her position as patrolman
after the new director of security
is hired, thus expanding the size
of the force by one person.

Digin, 22, has had three years
experience with the U.S. Army
Military Police, and is a 1976
graduate of Lewisburg High
School.

The University has received
three applications for the newly
created position of director since

it last offered the job to David
Castilow of Omaha, Neb. Casti-
low refused the University’s offer
Dec. 3.

Although Zeller said he hopes
to have a new director hired soon,
he ‘‘can’t guarantee it.’’ In the
meantime, there will be ‘‘some
modest changes, but nothing
drastic’ in the security staff
under Amarante, Zeller said.

Zeller said he hoped to have a
new director of security on the
job by January in order to begin a
revamping of the department,
and to make it ‘‘more profes-
sional.” Structural changes in the
operation of security are ex-
pected to include a new “pattern
of operation” with ‘‘someone on
duty 24 hours a day, seven days a
week,” Zeller said.

Women sweep GPAs

By BILL THUM

The mean grade point average for undergraduate students here last
semester was 2.9, according to statistics released Jan. 21 by the Office
of the Registrar.

Women consistently scored higher G.P.A.'s than did the men, but
while sorority women scored higher than the non-sorority women, non-
fraternity and fraternity men achieved equal G,P.A.s.

The registrar said students’ grades improve as they get older. Mean
grade point averages for men are recorded as 2.7 for freshmen and
sophomores, 2.8 for juniors and 3.0 for seniors. This represents a
decline in the mean G.P.A.s from 2.8 for sophomores and 3.0 for
juniors in the previous semester.

Women’s G.P.A.s are 2.9 for freshmen, 3.0 for sophomores, 3.1 for
juniors and 3.2 for seniors. This also represents a drop in the mean
G.P.A.s from 3.2 for juniors and 3.3 for seniors while sophomores in-
creased from 2.9 in the previous semester.

A further breakdown of the statistics follows:

Fraternities: Sigma Alpha Epsilon, 3.2; Tau Kappa Epsilon, 3.0;
Delta Upsilon, 2.9; Kappa Delta Rho, 2.9; Lambda Chi Alpha, 2.9; Phi
Lambda Theta, 2.9; Sigma Phi Epsilon, 2.9; Sigma Chi, 2.8; Kappa
Sigma, 2.7; Phi Kappa Psi, 2.7; Theta Chi, 2.7; Phi Gamma Delta, 2.6;

Transcript of
Suarez’s first

Address

Below is a transcript of the text
of the inaugural address which
ABS President Michael Suarez
’82 delivered to members of the
ABS Congress at meetings both
Monday and Wednesday nights.

All the great houses that ever sat have
begun their endeavors with a moment of
silent prayer. It is especially fitting that we
do this tonight not only because of the im-
portance of the task which lies before us, but
also because we should show our respect for
the father of (ABS) Congressman Vergil
Blake, who died only a few days ago.
(Pause)

On a more optimistic note, I have promis-
ed you something different; I have called
you anew Congress; I have said that you and
the office you hold are far more important
than you realize. q

The ravings of an idealistic leader?
Perhaps. But perhaps not. See if the follow-
ing isn’t familiar to you.

Little gets accomplished at Monday night
meetings; discussions often seem to have no
point; the effectiveness of proposals is ques-
tionable. In short, we are frustrated. Mean-
while, the ABS has an image problem
because even when we do something con-
structive, nobody knows about it.

John Dzurinko has nothing to apologize
for, and neither do you as a congress.
However, we desperately need to change our
method of attack and it must be exactly that.
We will be a congress armed with informa-
tion and imagination. We will effect visible
and tractable programs for the student body.
We are not politicians; we are a group of con-
cerned students who are committed to im-
proving student life. Proposals have proven
to be ineffective in providing tangible results
for students.

We are, therefore, the first ABS Congress
to place its primary emphasis upon pro-
grams for students. When we must make
proposals, they will be based upon sound in-
formation and research.-In short, we will
deal with trustees, administrators and facul-
ty on their own level as far as possible.

Some of you look incredulous and I.don’t
blame you—here’s how we're going to do it.

The ABS will never run a program alone —
we will work with outside organizations. For
example, 1981 is the Year of Disabled Per-
sons. ABS is working with Concern and Ac-
tion to sponsor a Disability Awareness week
involving talks by Bucknell alumni and
students with disabilities, a day where
students can go to class in a wheelchair and
the like.

Another example is the Student Handbook.
Quite obviously, it doesn’t do the job. Ihave
already commissioned a group of students —
none of whom are congressmen — to work on
the publication of a new book in time for the
fall semester. We have similar plans for a
student course evaluation for next spring.

We need to sponsor social alternatives; to
explore and act on issues such as the length
of the supposed reading period, why students
are afraid to go to the dispensary and the
ideal of community at Bucknell.

Experience has shown that committees
often don’t work in week-to-week operations.
We will, therefore, use committees only
when necessary. Rather, we will work in
two-man teams. Each team is responsible
for gathering information and ideas,
establishing contacts and making recom-
mendations to the congress.

Every representative will work on a team
of his or her choosing. Every team will
report to the congress. Most often our
meetings will not be deliberations but will
rather be working problem-solving sessions.
I can promise that every meeting will be dif-
ferent and will challenge you.

The task-oriented team approach will
radically improve the effectiveness of our
congress. It will require two things of you:
First, a new expertise in creative program
development and problem solving. Second, it
will demand your time. The teams will work
only if you fulfill your commitment to your
office.

Because you will be spending more time
outside of the meetings, we will make them
as short, enjoyable and yet businesslike as
possible. We'll say more about how we'll
develop the expertise when we get to the
“new business” part of this meeting.

Finally, on behalf of the steering commit-
tee, I would like to ask the new congress, as
my first official act as ABS president, to
rededicate themselves by taking the oath of
office that we have just taken before you.

What more needs to be said? Nothing ex-
cept thank you for listening so attentively. 1
know we can make this thing work. It’s a
whole new ballgame.

Suarez pushes for ABS revitalization

From ABS, page 1.
done by the teams and committees.

As a result of the increased work that will be done independently
and in committee, fewer meetings may be necessary, Suarez said,
and they will be made “‘as short, enjoyable, and yet as businesslike
as possible.” ‘

ABS Vice President Melissa Campbell ’82 reported that in follow-
ing with the new concern for student recognition and awareness of
ABS activities, new meeting times and places will be implemented.
By using public places for meetings, students may actually ex-
perience the ABS in action, thus increasing the Congress’ exposure
by providing greater opportunity for student input, Campbell said.

The steering committee has planned a leadership seminar at the
conference center in Cowan today and Saturday entitled “People
Support What They Help Create.” The seminar is targeted at outlin-
ing the ‘new’ Congress and its team structure, and developing an
awareness of the University community, from administrative,
academic and social perspectives. Saturday’s events will include ad-
dresses from Vice President for Administration and Finance John
Zeller, Assistant Dean of Student Affairs Joseph Mammola, Dean of
the College of Engineering Barry Maxwell, and Dean of the College
of Arts and Sciences Robert Chambers.

Suarez said he expects at least two-thirds of the Congress to at-
tend the seminar.

The steering committee itself has also been planning some
changes within the ABS’ actual operating sphere. Campbell said she
plans to revitalize the election process through increased publicity.
She hopes to attract more candidates for office and to increase stu-
dent body awareness and involvement in ABS activities.

Treasurer Andy Brody ’82 said he is in the process of streamlining
the ABS appropriations budget, to determine where ABS funds are
distributed, and why they are there.

In the planning stages for the agenda of the new Congress is a
“Disability Week,” with first-hand information about handicaps
many people — including some University students — must cope
with every day.

A revamped student handbook is also being planned, in which stu-
dent: activity descriptions, the University history, and an awareness
of the services in the Lewisburg area will supplement the present
handbook.

A course evaluation guide is also being considered as a future pro-
ject. Other topics to be discussed are the present length of the
reading period, which many consider to be too short, and Dispen-
sary services, which many students are unaware of.

The first official meeting of the “new” ABS was attended by 18
voting members. Largely due to the low attendance, Suarez
repeated the opening ceremonies at a special meeting Wednesday
evening.

Poland nominates
new prime minister

Polish Defense Minister
General Wojciech Jaruzelski
was nominated to replace
dismissed Prime Minister Jozef
Pinkowski at a meeting of the
Central Committee of the Polish
Communist Party Monday.

Jaruzelski, a Soviet-trained of-
ficer, is generally regarded as a
moderate. His appointment was
seen as a way to increase the
military’s influence in a time of
uncertainty since the new
general strike broke out in the
southwest and labor unrest con-
tinued elsewhere in the country.

No reason was given for the
dismissal of Pinkowski, who was
appointed prime minister at the
height of the strikes last August.

Chapman confers

with lawyer on trial

Mark David Chapman, ac-
cused of murdering John Lennon
last December, is undergoing
mental tests in the Riker’s
Island prison infirmary in New
York City and conferring with
his lawyer on the _ insanity
defense to be used at his trial.

Chapman, who allegedly at-
tempted suicide twice before the
shooting, was apparently ob-
sessed with Lennon.

A trial date is expected to be
set after preliminary motions in
the State Supreme Court later
this month.

Eight people killed
in Vegas hotel fire

Eight people were killed and
198 were injured in a fire that
swept through a Hilton Hotel in
Las Vegas Wednesday night. Fire
Chief Roy Parrish of Clark Coun-

ty declared that the blaze was
“definitely arson.”

The fire, which caused an
estimated $10 million in
damages, was apparently set in
four places on the second, third,
eighth and ninth floors.

Henry Lewin, the executive
vice president in charge of gam-
ing, was asked if there had been
extortion demands. ‘‘No extor-
tion,” he replied, ‘‘but telephone
calls saying, ‘Is the fire still on?
Have they got you yet?’ and also
asking if I’m ithe hotel.” Asked
if he had reason to believe the fire
was directed at him, Lewin
answered, ‘“‘I tell you, that’s an
assumption, it’s a man who
hates.”

Grants, loans for

students to be cut

The primary target in the
Reagan Administration’s efforts
to cut Federal spending in
education would be loans and
grants to college students,
Secretary of Education T. H.
Bell said.

In an interview with the New
York Times Jan. 28, Bell said
the proposal will include cut-
backs on both the Basic Educa-
tional Opportunity Grants and
the loan programs. He also
reiterated the Administration’s
belief that education is primari-
ly astate and local affair.

Thornburgh wants

liquor stores sold

Pennsylvania Gov. Dick
Thornburgh proposed Jan. 28
that the state sell its 725 liquor
stores to private owners. Such
an action would end the state’s
48 year-old monopoly on the sale
of wine and hard liquor.

The legislation — which will
be brought before the State
Senate — would allow the crea-
tion of as many retail liquor
stores ‘‘as market condition,
licensing requirements, local op-
tions and zoning regulations will
nermit,”’ Thornburgh said.

Lee Idleman ’54 of Madison,
N.J., has been named to the
University’s board of trustees.

Idleman, 47, was also recently
named to the board of directors of
the Dean Witter Reynolds invest-
ment firm where he has been
senior vice president and director
of research since January 1980.

While at Bucknell, he was
president of Delta Mu Delta —
the business administration
honor society — and was
treasurer of Kappa Delta Rho
fraternity. He has served as a
member of the trustees’ Subcom-
mittee on Investments for
several years.

Lehigh University
seeks new president

The Presidential Search Com-
mittee at Lehigh University is
presently in quest of nominees
capable of replacing University
President Deming Lewis, who
will retire July 1, 1982.

The 1l-member committee is
a creation of the Succession
Committeee of the Board of
Trustees, according to commit-
tee chairman George Kane.
“They want us to submit two or
more names of persons we feel
are best qualified for the job by

Nuclear power topic
for coming lecture

Judith Johnsrud, co-director of
the State College Chapter of the
Environmental Coalition on
Nuclear Power, will present a
lecture on ‘“‘The Role of Nuclear
Power in our Energy Future’’ at
7:30 p.m. Tuesday in the Forum
of the University Center.

Johnsrud, also a member of the
Citizen’s Advisory to the Penn-
sylvania Governor’s Energy
Council, holds a doctorate in
geography and was a part-time
instructor in that subject here in
the spring of 1978 and 1979.

Naser arrested for

possession of drugs

The case of Curtis Lee Naser,
21, of Lewisburg — who has
been charged with drug law
violations and receiving stolen
property Feb. 4 — has been sent
to Union County Court.

After a preliminary hearing
Monday afternoon, Lewisburg
Area District Justice Leo Arm-
bruster determined there was
enough evidence to hold Naser,
who is free on $5000 bail.

Three charges of possession of
marijuana and marijuana seeds
with intent to deliver or
manufacture, both felonies,
were reduced to possession
charges because the state did
not present enough evidence to
establish intent, Armbruster
said.

Naser, who was enrolled at
the University in September 1977
and studied here for three
semesters, will appear before
the court in June.

An evolutionary process

The University has hired an average of one security officer per
month for the past three months. Two of the officers hired filled
vacancies in the department. The third represents an expansion in
the size of the force. All three patrolmen are highly experienced and
faced rigid competition to land their positions.

These hirings mark a positive turn in the evolution of the securi-
ty force. One of the patrolmen has served 20 years with the New
York City Police Department, another has an associate’s degree in
police administration and the most recently hired patrolman has
worked for the FBI and as an MP in the U.S. Army.

The most recently hired patrolman is also a woman, the first on
the force. Whether this occurrence is by accident or design is not
relevant. What is important is that the University has actually taken
a progressive action to improve the services of the staff. The action
is progressive because the students, half of whom are women, will
finally be served by a female on the previously all-male security
force.

This is a step toward helping security aid and serve all the
students effectively and completely. It could help promote better
rapport between students and security; this is essential to the fulfill-
ment of security’s responsibilities.

Perhaps the next step is to get ourselves a director to lead the
unit.

Claws that catch

Determining the budget is a thankless job. When faced with
soaring inflation, inequitable past compensation and human nature
— along with a glutted market, a fragile economy and consumer
unrest — the task reaches nightmare proportions.

While the reasoning and necessity of a $1100 tuition increase are
apparent, the implications of this event are disturbing. Particularly
troubling is the realization that once even symbolically guaranteed
in contract, continued equally high inflation is inevitable.

The solution. . . not a further padding of the budget, nor the can-
nabilistic consumption of our precious endowment income. Instead,
the problem must be attacked at its roots.

If budget necessities require a 15.2 percent increase in tuition,
limit the budget to only 14.2 percent. By ratcheting down inflation
administratively, the vicious circle can be arrested and the chaotic
spiralling brought to a halt.

Of course, someone will suffer due to this harsh policy. Since
more than 65 percent of the budget increase goes to personnel com-
pensation, with the rest representing fixed cost increases, the facul-
ty, administration and staff will not maintain the 14.5 percent in-
crease with such a policy.

The trade-off is real and something we all have to face if we are
to regain some stability in our economy.

So we challenge the board of trustees to make the difficult deci-
sion. Weigh the value of balancing the budget in reaction to inflation,
or using the budget for a more stable future. The latter choice is
clearly the more difficult, but in the long run is possibly the only sen-
sible alternative.

The Wattsmobile

We wrote five months ago to publicly thank University officials
for acting quickly and gladly to brighten up our then-dingy working
quarters. Where there was squalor and drab, they made cheer-
fulness and color.

Now, these same people have made our second wish come true.
Despite the objections of certain other administrators, John Dunlop
and John Zeller are providing us with a permanent set of wheels ef-
fective this week, and already we are ever-grateful.

But our gratitude is tinged with a sense of historic irony; it is an
irony that should not be lost in the euphoria of our mobile moments.
You see, this is no ordinary car they have delivered unto us. A Cita-
tion or a station wagon? No. Ostentatious as it might seem at first
glance, the Bucknellian staff is now driving a 1976 Buick Limited — a
great tank of a car with automatic everything that was once the of-
ficial car of former University President Charles Watts.

The irony here is that this car — saved at the last minute from
the Cadillac Ranch — belonged to Watts, a man whose witticisms
and cheery disposition, we are told, covered a somewhat seething
resentment for college journalism. Especially here in Lewisburg.

And so, with a sense of pleasantly perverted history, we name
our big black gas-guzzler . . . The Wattsmobile.

Trudeau and Doonesbury
bring humor to Bucknellians

“Doonesbury,” the controversial political commentary-turned-
a strip, will appear each week in the Bucknellian beginning
today.

The popular strip, often championed by students, has its roots
at Yale University. Garry B. Trudeau, “Doonesbury’s’”’ 32 year
old creator, first ran his opinionated cartoons in the Yale campus
newspaper in 1968.

Since its birth, “Doonesbury” has been gaining in popularity,
boasting a following of 60 million readers in the United States
and Canada. More than 449 daily newspapers feature the strip,
for which Trudeau was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1976.

The strip, which originally ran under the title “Bull Tales,”
changed its name when Jim Andrews (a partner in the Universal
Press Syndicate), decided it might be offensive to some readers.

The name Doonesbury is actually an amalgam of two words:
doone, an old prep-school term for someone who is not playing
with a full deck, and Pillsbury, after Trudeau’s roommate,
Charles Pillsbury. Pillsbury is a flour-fortune heir who is an ac-
tive liberal Democrat in Connecticut.

“Doonesbury” does have its enemies, however. Recently, six
newspapers refused to print the strip, which featured a TV-
program trip through Ronald Reagan’s brain.

To the Editor:

On behalf of the Annual Giving
office and the Phon-a-thon Steer-
ing Committee, I would like to ex-
press my sincere thanks to all the
Bucknellians who participated in
this year’s January Phon-a-thon.
Our $163,071 total would not have
been possible without the support
of the three hundred and fifty
students who donated their time
and effort.

Approximately 30,000 alumni
were called during the month; 34
percent of whom were reached.
One of the Phon-a-thon’s goals
was to raise new and increased
money and we were very suc-
cessful in achieving this goal.
Almost $74,000 of the $163,071
raised was new and increased
money: an impressive statistic.

Bucknell is extremely for-
tunate to have such enthusiastic

volunteers. You all did an ex-
cellent job and should be ex-
tremely proud of your worthwhile
contribution. Many thanks again.

Kwanza loses

To the Editor:

Last week was noted by the
celebration of Kwanza, spon-
sored by the Black Student
Alliance, which was one of the
main cultural events on campus
this semester. Yet there was one
problem: the sharing of culture
never occurred. For instance, at
the opening ceremonies only four
white people attended. It is very
sad when you can count the spec-
tators present. Now, I realize that
the advertising for the cere-
monies was not too profuse, but
people notice when there is one
poster up for a frat party.

At the same time of this
ceremony, ‘Rudolph the Red
Nose Reindeer’’ was on the TV.
In Roberts Lounge alone over
thirty-five people watched it. So it
can’t be said that students were
too busy studying to attend the
ceremonies. Aren’t other people
more important than some stupid
TV program?

He comes not to bury nor praise, but just to prod

By Phil Andrews

Much reasoning is done to make the status quo seem
reasonable — even, of course, when it is not. After ex-
amining the status quo of the ABS, I have concluded that
neither its structure nor its issue orientation accords with
reason.

Unless one has read the ABS Constitution, one might
divine that the main function of the ABS Congress is to
criticize John Zeller’s annual proposals to raise tuition
and fees. Unfortunately, the Congress deserves this image
for its inaction on other issues over the years.

On a slightly different tack, a person visiting the cam-
pus on a typical weekend might well surmise that frater-
nities set the tone of the social life here. He might also
observe that this oligopoly benefits greatly from the
absence of a publicly funded competitor (i.e., the ABS).

After a month of interviewing a broad assortment of

_ Student, administration and faculty leaders about the
state of the ABS, I have concluded that the two
phenomena described above — the Congress and the
dearth of social alternatives — are the ABS’ major short-
comings.

What are the causes of these weaknesses?

With regard to the ABS Congress, I believe there are

three major reasons for its near-constant docility.

First, many congressmen are not committed to im-
proving the ABS — unless time, effort and attendance are
discounted as measures of commitment. Only freshmen
dorm representative races are competitive, and since
“Congressman” looks good on a resume, a considerable
number of persons run for less than noble reasons.

Second, most dorm council presidents exhibit little if
any commitment to attend, and no observable tendency to
participate in Congress meetings.

And third, the ABS president dominates the Congress
because he presides over it. Although the president is sup-
posed to be an impartial moderator, he inevitably
becomes the legislative leader. Thus, he serves as chief
executive, chief judge, and chief legislator. Efficient?
Yes. Dangerous? I think so.

In contrast to the near-everything role of the presi-
dent is the near-nothing role of the typical congressman.

Rarely, if ever, does a congressman propose legisla-
tion. Rarely, if ever, does the Congress ask for reports
from the students it has selected for committees. And
rarely, if ever, does a congressman seek out student opi-
nion. By and large, they are a passive bunch.

That, of course, is not the way it should or has to be.
The following reforms would result in a more assertive,
respected, and conscientious Congress:

1. Switch from dorm-based representation to
departmental-based representation. Freshmen dorm
representatives, however, should be retained, because
freshmen are more attached to their dorms than to their
majors. Additionally, the eight at-large spots — and the
IFC, Panhell and class presidents—should be kept as
members. They contribute.

President O’Brien created a similar system at Mid-
dlebury a few years back. According to Middlebury’s
dean of students, the system is “remarkably stable’’ and
“the most serious students are apt to be involved.”

At Middlebury, a student advisory committee was
formed in each department. The chairman was
automatically the representative to the student congress.

PHILLING IN

2. Dorm council presidents should be removed from
membership in the Congress. As mentioned earlier, they
are not often physically — and virtually never mentally —
present at Congress meetings.

3. The ABS vice-president, rather than the president,
should preside over the Congress. The president is suppos-
ed to be the chief executive, not the chief legislator or the
chief judge. Removing this responsibility would free him
to concentrate on executive duties, give the vice-president
a meaningful role, and markedly reduce the psychological
dominance that the ABS president has over the Congress.

With regard to the dominant role of fraternities in the
social life at Bucknell, there appear to be several reasons
for this phenomenon.

First, there is a strong fraternity tradition here (since
1848!). Although they were banned once for 13 years in the
1860s and 70s, only one of four collapsed during that time.

Second, Pennsylvania’s indefensibly high drinking
age makes fraternities the only bountiful and legitimate
distributors of alcohol to ‘‘underage”’ drinkers.

And third, first semester rush fosters and perpetuates
the notion that fraternities are central to the social life
here. Ergo, if you don’t join, you miss out.

Regrettably, the message rings true. While the Coffee
House and Christy’s Gate are important contributions to
non-fraternity social life, they are only partial alter-
natives to fraternity parties. Much more extensive alter-
natives are needed. Drawing from the interviews, I
recommend the ABS do the following:

1. Form a coalition of educational, social and profes-
sional groups to lobby for lowering the drinking age.
President O’Brien suggested lobbying for a change that
would permit clubs to serve beer and wine to 18-21 year
olds. It’s worth a try.

2. Establish a weekend alternatives committee and
provide it with ample funds to sponsor several dances and
band parties et. al. each semester.

3. Continue to pressure the administration to complete
the University Center’s third floor. Provost Wendell Smith
told me the ABS work was “effective” and ‘‘may cause us
to move more rapidly.”’

4. Find a permanent home for Christy’s Gate. Beth
Sipple deserves at least this much for coming up with such
a marvelous idea (‘‘Sipple’s Gate?”’).

5. Consider hiring an assistant for two superb, but
overworked student programs coordinators — Jim Ham-
merlee and Ruth Burnham. Hammerlee says he “could
make this place hum” with one more assistant.

6. Raise the student activities fee to finance the pro-
grams above.

Albert North Whitehead once wrote, ‘‘The art of pro-
gress is to preserve order amid change, and to preserve
change amid order.”

The purpose of this column is not to praise the ABS,
nor to bury it. It is to prod the ABS to transform itself from
a pussycat into a tiger — without losing its stripes.

That question was asked of many students by their parents after the
fire at Providence College which claimed the lives of nine students
several years ago. Similar questions are being asked today because of
the MGM Hotel fire in Las Vegas or the nursing home fire in New Jersey.

Why did those students die at Providence College?

Several died because they panicked and jumped from fourth floor
windows unnecessarily. Several were asphyxiated because they tried to
find their way down a smoke filled hall.

Others stayed in their rooms, stuffed towels under the door, and
were rescued in due course.

DO YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO IF THERE IS A FIRE IN YOUR DORM?

The most important principle is don’t panic.

Get out quickly if you can. Walk, don't run to the nearest firestairs.

Sound the alarm. The sooner the firemen are summoned, the better.

Do you know how? Is the emergency instructor card posted by your
phone? Have you memorized the emergency number—1111?

Do what you can to be sure that everyone is awake and out of the
building.

Once outside, count heads and double check.

If the fire is confined to a small area; and you can safely approach it,
use the fire extinguishers.

If the fire is ina room or small area, confine it by closing the doors
and cutting off oxygen until the firemen arrive.

If you are trapped in your room, stuff towels under and around the
cracks in the door. Go to the window and await rescue, or hang a towel
or sheet from the window to attract attention. Do not panic.

WHAT CAUSES DORMITORY FIRES?

Fires are caused by many things, most of them thoughtless: a
carelessly placed candle, faulty wiring on an old appliance or a worn ex-
tension cord, cooking in rooms (hot fat is very dangerous—the kitchens
have special automatic extinguisher systems), smoking in bed, or a
match in a wastebasket.

The University makes every. effort te make your dorm firesafe.
Sprinkler systems or fire detection devices have been installed in every
room and corridor. Except at Bucknell West, these are connected to a

central alarm system which will automatically warn the operator on duty

at the powerhouse who will dispatch a security officer to the scene

immediately. But they do ‘not automatically call the fire company. You
must do that yourself by dialing the emergency number—1111.

There are approved fire escapes on all multi-story buildings, and
enclosed fireproof stairtowers have been installed in every large dorm to
meet the standards of the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and In-
dustry. Fire-rated doors, walls, and ceilings are standard everywhere.
They will prevent the rapid spread of flames and assure time to escape.
But they can’t stop smoke and lethal gases, and fire doors won't work if
they are propped open.

It is the contents which burn, and the contents which create toxic
smoke and lead to asphyxiation.

What have you introduced into your room that could lead to death?
Flammable nets or drapes? Combustible plywood for lofts? Cardboard or
paper products? Candles burning too near a drape or curtain? Too many
electrical appliances that overload the electrical system? A tangle of
extension cords? Combustible plastics that produce lethal fumes when
burned?

Fire extinguishers have been installed at convenient locations to be
used in an emergency. Who is responsible for a death that results
because the fire extinguisher was empty when it was needed? Who
emptied the fire extinguisher? The physical plant and residential life of-
fices report that an average of ten or more fire extinguishers are emp-
tied frivolously each month on this campus. Although checks are made
regularly, they cannot be made daily or hourly. When you empty a fire
extinguisher, you endanger the lives of your roommates.

Fire drills are a necessary precaution. When the alarm sounds, do
you drop everything and get out immediately? Or do you turn over and
go back to sleep assuming it’s a prank? Whose fault is it if you don't get
out safely.in a real fire? It’s your life! Have you carelessly put it at risk?
Have you made it plain to your peers that you won't tolerate pranks that
do so? F

Safety is everyone's business, and everyone's responsibility.
Is your dorm safe? — Only if you keep it so.

Feminists support
virtuous virmen?

By Frank Patrick

Men! We — you and I — have been guilty of a grievous fault. We
have been speaking sexist language all our lives, to the gross injury of
the female sex.

Ladies! Forgive us, for we knew not what we did. When we used
such phrases as ‘All men are created equal,” we did not realize that
we were leaving you out. We honestly thought that “men” covered all
human beings, male and female alike.

What chauvinist pigs we were! But, you must admit, we were not
alone in our error. Many a woman has reaced a certain age without be-
ing aware that she was the victim of sexist language. She probably
talked it herself. It is only recently that her consciousness has been
raised and she has come to see that using “man” and “lie” to
designate a human being without distinction of sex is a studied insult
to women.

But now the dawn has come and we all see — do we not? — that in
fairness we must always use ‘“‘person’”’ and “‘he or she” instead of the
old, offensive ‘“‘man”’ and “‘he.””

‘All persons are created equal” lacks the crispness of Jefferson’s
phrase, but it says exactly what it means. There is some loss to
Shakespeare’s poetic quality in saying, “What a piece of work is per-
son!”’ There is a definite loss in making the Psalmist ask, ‘‘What is
person that Thou art mindful of him or her?”

But this may not be too high a price to pay for sexual equality.
When we come to Alexander Pope’s line, ‘Presume not God to scan;
the proper study of personkind is person,” however, we can’t help feel-
ing that something has gone wrong with the way we use the English
tongue.

What has gone wrong is the feminists’ insistence that “man” and
“he” refer exclusively to the male sex. In fact, the primary meaning
of “man” is “human being.” The name of our species is Man, and it is
applied only secondarily to the two sexes.

What, after all, is “woman” but the word “man” with a prefix
(“wo”) meaning “female?” If we want to reform the English
language, we’d do better to keep “man” as referring to any human be-
ing, male or female, and to think up a prefix meaning ‘“‘male”’ that we
can put before “‘man’’ to correspond to the ‘‘wo” in “woman.”

The obvious prefix to use would be “male.” But calling half the
human race “‘malemen” would suggest that the Post Office is even
more overstaffed than it really is. A better solution would be to use the
Latin word “vir.”’ It is an unambiguous word that means “‘adult male
human being” and nothing else. I propose, therefore, that from now on
we call adult males “‘virmen” to distinguish them from women.

The beauty of this new word is that, when pronounced rapidly, it
sounds just like “vermin,” which is what feminists want to call us
anyhow. We males, on the other hand, can take comfort in the thought
that “virmen”’ calls attention to both our virility and our virtue. The
new word will please both sides and make everyone happy. Then we
can go back to saying that all men are created equal without feeling
guilty about it.

Fines and morality interchangeable?

By John Dzurinko

February 3 was registration
day, and 262 students registered
late. Reasons for this behavior
are manifold. They range from
extraneous circumstances, such
as weather, to students purpose-
ly extending their vacations.

The registrar, Dr. Freed,
estimates that 50 percent of the
truants have legitimate excuses.
Those who do not have valid
reasons pay a small financial
penalty, which covers the ad-
ministrative costs of late
registration. Most students will-
ingly accept this punishment,
and the issue is forgotten.

The practice of using financial
penalities for late registration,
however, is a minor symptom of
a major problem. It has become
socially acceptable in many
cases to break rules and redeem
oneself by simply paying a
financial penalty. Such thinking
poses grave dangers.

“The extent of the power of
money is the extent of the per-
son’s power.” Is this true? Is
this a principle widely accepted
in our society? If so, what a per-
son is, or is capable of, is not
necessarily determined by the

person’s individuality.

The fact that money can mean
special privilege places great
importance on the educational
process at Bucknell. It also calls
into question the underlying suc-
cess of Bucknell, and of other
colleges and universities, in
awakening consciousness and
moral responsibility — both on a
personal level and a communal
level. This is essential in
preventing abuse of power.

A liberal arts education is sup-
posed to help students ap-
preciate the finer things in life
which cannot be purchased with
money. Yet how appealing to
most students is monetary suc-
cess in the nonacademic world?
And what will be sacrificed for
it?

Throughout our society, it is
generally accepted that a
measure of the value we place
on anything is the price we will
pay for it. Utilitarian
cost/benefit analysis follows
from this theory: “If the
benefits of breaking the rule

outweigh the costs,
choose to break the rule.”

It is hoped, however, that any
external coercive measures,
whether financial or not, in con-
junction with the educational
process, will lead to the develop-
ment of an internal state of con-
sciousness of high morality.

It would be highly unfortunate
if, after four years at Bucknell,
one’s values were abandoned for
a pay check or career op-
portunities.Certain human prin-
ciples are founded on values
which money can transform.
Consider how many times we
have heard “‘the best things in
life are free.”

The late registration fee
serves as a reminder that finan-
cial payment does not cleanse
the soul of irresponsible actions.
Instead, it is a means of attain-
ing virtue which can neither be
bought or sold.

| Faculty and students explore
|! nature of ‘The American Way’

By LYNNE RUTHERFORD

The dark era of communist witch hunts and Mc-
Carthyism will be recreated in a theatrical produc-
tion in Tustin Gym at 8:30 p.m. Saturday and Sun-
day.

A project of Visiting Assistant Professor of
Theater and English Jeffry Walker, the production
is entitled “The American Way” and was inspired

. by Eric Bently’s play, “Are You Now or Have You
Photo—Tim Hoying

Ever Been” — a probe into the effect the communist
Soprano Davida Kagen and bass Kyle Hancock perform during F

scare had on the show business community.

As a graduate student, Walker had studied and
acted in the piece, but this production goes beyond
the realm of writers and actors and includes clips
from periodicals as recent as last month and quota-
tions from new political speeches.

The cast of 23 is comprised of students, faculty
and town residents, who will portray such
luminaries as Albert Einstein, Zero Mostel, and
Berthold Brecht. Among those participated are Pro-
fessor of English Karl Patten, Instructor in Political
Science Linda Thomas, and Professor of Political
Science Gene Chenoweth.

“We wanted to explore the variety of testimony,
the different ways in which individuals handled the
confrontation. They are vastly different—some

became friendly to the committee, some took the

fifth amendment and refused to testify,’ Walker
said.

In selecting material, Walker — now on a year’s

-leave of absence — and co-ordinator Douglas

Allchin ’79 sifted through newspaper clippings, par-
ty platforms and magazines from 1938 to this year.
“The American Way”’ became a study of the con-
frontation between intellectuals and conservatives
that began in 1938 and continues to this day, ac-
cording to Walker. The participants hope, in turn,
that the project will generate discussion among all
who see it and the University community in general,
he said.

While Walker dislikes labels, his brand of theater
deals more openly with contemporary issues than
that most students are used to. In many ways, the
election of Ronald Reagan and his already
implemented plans to pursue the formation of in-
telligence committees prompted “The American
Way.”

“Reagan and other right-wing politicians talk
about and have begun to reinstitute groups on inter-
nal surveillance, and it reminded me of this
previous period in our history. It seemed we
assured ourselves that McCarthyism was over, yet
now_it seems that it is more fundamental to our
government than we care to admit,”’ Walker said.

David Bromberg will come to campus Feb. 2

Showtimes are 7:30 and 10:30 p.m.

8 to headline “An Evening of Acoustic Music.”

evening of acoustics

By AMY KENNEDY

Folk artist David Bromberg
will bring his musical talents to
Coleman Theatre in a concert
entitled ‘‘An Evening of
Acoustic Music with David
Bromberg.”

The show will be Feb. 28 with
two performances at 7:30-and
10:30 p.m. Ticket price is $5.

Recently, Bromberg released
“My Own House,” an album
which placed him in the position
of producer and performer. By
doing so, Bromberg left the
electronically orchestrated
recordings that were present in
previous albums and returned to
the acoustic guitar selections
that earned him his name.

Philadelphia born, Bromberg
grew up in Tarrytown, N.Y. In-
spired by the work of Pete
Seeger, he began studying
guitar at age 13. Eventually, he
was drawn to Greenwich Village
NY during the Coffeehouse era

C and D’s ‘Our Town’ begins production

The cast has been set for Thornton Wilder’s
“Our Town,” Cap and Dagger’s fourth
theatrical venture of the year. Auditions were
held Monday and Tuesday for the March 13,
14 and 15 production.

Included in the cast are Barry Fishel ’81 as
the Stage Manager, William Walters ’82 as
Dr. Gibbs, Assistant Director of Annual Giv-
ing Susan Hagerty ’80 as Mrs. Gibbs, Gwyn
English ’81 as Emily Gibbs, Jeff Lechlecter
84 as George Gibbs, Nancy Sanford ’84 as
Rebecca Gibbs, Patrick Pedro ’81 as Mr.
Webb, Ingrid Wills 83 as Mrs. Webb, area
resident Elly Harris as Wally Webb and
Associate Professor of English Anthony
Gosse as Professor Willard.

Also Peter Margulis ’82 as Howie Newsome,

Mifflinburg residents Norman and Jason Rip-
pon as Joe and Si Crowell, Heather Sawyer "83
as Mrs. Soames, Dave Hancock ’84 as Con-
stable Warren, Steve Schroko ’82 as Sam
Craig, T.J. Wilkison ’81 as Joe Stoddard and
Watsontown resident Jim Denton as Simon
Stimson.

The play will be directed by Allen Haines
81, an economics major fnom Allentown, Pa.
Lighting will be designed by David Polsky 81
and sets will be designed by graduate student
Debra Slade. Bruce Delaplane 82 will be the
stage manager with assistance from Jackie
Krull 83.

First produced in 1938, ‘Our Town,” won
the Pulitzer Prize for drama that year. Set in
a small village in turn of the century rural

America, the play deals sensitively with sim-
ple, daily events in the cycle of life and death.
In Wilder’s own words, it represents “‘an at-
tempt to find a value above all price for the
smallest events in our daily life.”

“Our Town’? will represent a departure
from this year’s earlier works. Unlike “Tar-
tuffe” or “A Funny Thing Happened on the
Way to the Forum,” the sparity of set design
designated by Wilder will challenge actors to
create a small town environment without use
of lavish scenery.

Cap and Dagger’s next mainstage produc-
tion will be ‘‘The Rivals’, set for presentation
in early May. In addition, students in direc-
ting class have selected one act plays for
presentation in spring Cocktail Theaters.

Wessman installation adds mystery to the

of the 1960’s.

Bromberg’s extraordinary
guitar picking and exceptional
stylistic range brought him to
the attention of many other
musicians. Before striking out
on his own with a solo album,
Bromberg appeared on 72 other
albums with performers — like
Bob Dylan, Ringo Starr and jazz
artist Jerry Jeff Walker. Such
versatility prompted New York
Times jazz critic John S. Wilson
to write ‘‘He fits no pigeonholes.
He is part of everything contem-
porarily musical. He is a prod-
uct of blues, country, jazz, folk
and classical music.”

Slowly, Bromberg’s popularity
has climbed and he has become
a favorite in concert halls,
nightclubs and colleges across
the nation. In addition to pure
musical prowess, Bromberg at-
tempts to become personally in-
volved with his audience by tell-
ing anecdotes and jokes.

The Bucknell Concert Commit-
tee, troubled often by financial
problems in the past, is banking
on Bromberg’s current populari-
ty and much heralded charisma
to remain solvent.

“We're very pleased with the
popularity the show is receiving
and tickets are going fast,” ac-
cording to David Biggar 82,
stage manager for the commit-
tee.

“Coleman Theater’s size (1200
seats) is perfect for this show
because Bromberg especially
enjoys small audiences,” Biggar
said.

Guitarist Rich Getz and fiddler
Steve Tristan will perform prior
to each of Bromberg’s per-
formances.

Gallery

By DOUGLAS ALLCHIN

There’s a “contraption” occupying the Center Gallery on the
third floor of the University Center. At least it may appear so to
someone uninitiated to installations.

Installations are a relatively new art form. Sometimes sculptural
and sometimes architectural, they are designed exclusively for one
area and highlight that space.

Massachusetts artist Ann Peters Wessman has created such a
work for the Center Gallery, which went on display Monday and
will be in the Gallery through March 3. It is a series of hanging
strips 10 feet tall, 8 feet wide, and 20 feet long, which form a double-
funnel shaped tunnel.

An odd sight at first, the hanging corridor invites you to enter and
pass through — and that you should. The way to appreciate the
work is to investigate it.

“Passing through the work is part of the experience. I’d rather
people do it and interact with the piece,” Wessman said.

Perhaps you walk along one side, look through, and watch the
rhythmic breaking of images out the window, or your own reflec-
tion at night. Perhaps you discover the holes which pierce the se-
quence of layers. Or perhaps you notice the fibrous torn edges or
the light as it penetrates the distinctive fabric, which is actually a
thick form of paper covered with shellack to make it the color of
skin.

The work expresses ideas which appear in Wessman’s earlier
works as well. The human quality of fabric and paper as architec-
tural forms, the security of tight spaces, the dynamics of light and
layers of visibility have been a part of her previous work. The
works on exhibit in the library are interesting complements. Here,
Wessman used cigarettes to burn in her patterns.

“Cigarettes are one of the few things that will burn paper without
totally crumbling it,” Wessman said.

The main installation, as it reveals space and light — the inten- : : R abs
tion is that it be seen at different times of the day — is successful. = , : Praio lan alee Roauaberey

JOAN WADLEIGH CURRAN

Joan Wadleigh Curran, assis-
tant professor of art, is a recent
winner in the fourth annual Penn-
sylvania Women in the Arts Com-
petition held during January in
Harrisburg.

Curran’s drawings and pain-
tings, selected from 900 entries,
deal primarily with still life
groupings of nature, and contain
such images as stuffed birds,
animal skulls and deer antlers. In
addition, her paintings include a
wide range of vibrant colors.
These pieces were on display in
the William Penn Museum in
Harrisburg in January.

A recipient of a master’s
degree in drawing from Yale
University, Curran describes her

award-winning works as explora-
tions in ‘‘a limited shallow spatial
context to make the spectator
confront them in a more intimate
way.”

Peter Shaw ‘84 as Hero and Barry Fishel ‘81 as Pseudolus gawk
after courtesans in last weekend's “A Funny Thing Happened

on the Way to the Forum.”

By TODD G. BUCHHOLZ

I’m sure there were a few
pretentious snobs who left “A
Funny Thing Happened on the
Way to the Forum,” calling it
trivial and a waste of their
precious time. But they were
warned.

Right from the first number we
are told “tragedies tomorrow,
comedy tonight; morals tomor-
row, comedy tonight.’”’ And the
cast delivers.

Directed by James Denton Jr.
of Watsontown, ‘‘Forum”
presented Feb. 58 — is a
hilarious musical full of gags and
double entendres that provide
continuous laughter. In a way,
“Forum” is a collection of the
most familiar comedic stunts of
the 20th century.

There’s a chase scene, .a
haughty wife and a philandering
husband, a vaudevillian song
(“Everybody Ought to Have a
Maid”) and some imitations of
Paul Lynde, Groucho Marx and
Goldie Hawn. It is a very loose
and very funny production.

Written by Shevelove and
Gelbart and with music by
Stephen Sondheim, the play itself

syracuse

is a pretty thin piece of work. The
“boy meets girl; boy can’t have
girl; boy finally gets girl” plot is
simple and silly, while the score
is nice but undistinguished.

Such a veneer of a play forces
the company itself to provide its
own style and substance. And this
is where Cap and Dagger shines.

Sometime in January when the
play was rehearsed, Denton —
now directing his second Jan
Plan production — must have
told his players to “have a good

ARTS

time on stage”’ and volunteer new
material to the 1966 libretto. The
results are some antics more
reminiscent of the 1970s than the
1960s — when the play was writ-
ten — or of the time of the Roman
Empire, when the story takes
place.

And there are some stellar per-
formances. Pedro and Fishel
shine in their juggled roles as
Senex, the henpecked
philanderer, and as Pseudolus,
the slave who wins his freedom if
can deliver the beautiful virgin
courtesan to his young master,
Hero. Both Fishel and Pedro per-
form equally well in a vital role
that requires fine comic timing.
Throughout the play Pseudolus
bounces barbs and witticisms off
various straightmen. Freshman
Peter Shaw’s version of the
adolescent male — unsure of
himself, nervously pacing and
stomping his feet — is im-
pressive.

The most unusual character to
visit the stage of Coleman
Theatre recently is Marcus
Lycus, an unctuous owner and
seller of exotic women. Played
superbly and smoothly by Bob
Fessler ’84, Lycus seems to ooze
and slide about the set as he
demonstrates his assortment of
courtesans. With seductive and
often effeminate mannerisms ac-
companied by a voice that
squeals into the stratosphere,
Lycus is the perfect sleaze.

David Blackman ’82 performs
masterfully as the the frenzied
Hysterium, the head slave.
Fidgety and jittery, Blackman

Bob Fessler '84, Patrick Pedro 81, Fishel and David Bieckman
‘82 join forces for “Everybody Ought to Have a Maid.”

darts from one side of the stage to
the other. His rendition of “I’m
Calm’’ reveals a pleasant voice
and a good sense of timing as the
tempo spasmodically changes.

A friendly rapport with the au-
dience is generated throughout
the ‘‘Forum’’. Several times the
players directly address the
viewers. At one point Pseudolus
turns to the crowd and asks: ‘‘Do
you hear this? Are you listen-
ing?” During a chase scene that
involves most of the cast,
characters run through the au-
dience. During all performances,
Fishel and Pedro as Pseudolus
sat down in an empty chair,
turned to theatergoers next to
them and asked what they
thought of the show.

Billed as a musical comedy,
“Forum” seems much more
comedic than melodic. Sond-
heim’s score is sometimes
superfluous and often dull. The
cast, however, includes several
strong voices, especially among
females, as Carrie Wilshusen ’84
in the role of Domina and Karen
Spizziri’s ’82 mellifluous soprano
resonated for seconds after the
last note of her songs. Under the
baton of Visiting Assistant Pro-
fessor of Music Christopher
McGahan, the orchestra provid-

Page 19

ed fine support, particularly dur-
ing the jazzy dance routines of
the courtesans in the first act.

“Forum” is not an enlightening
play. If there’s a social message
intended to alter our perception
of mankind or the cosmos, it was
drowned out by chuckles. But
despite the triteness of the work,
quite a few funny things did hap-
pen on the way to the forum.

Ski club races to

second of six teams

The newly-formed Bucknell
Ski-Racing Club competed at the
Oregon Hill Ski Area Saturday
and Sunday, placing second
overall in a field of six teams in
the Penn State Invitational spon-
sored by the Allegheny Collegiate
Ski Conference.

Bucknell was bested by Kutz-

town but finished ahead of
Bloomsburg, Indiana (Pa.),
Kutztown State and Keystone
Junior State College.

Led by junior co-captains
Jack Snyder and Ron Reynier,
the team — consisting of two
men’s squads and one women’s
squad — also competed at
Camelback Jan. 31 and Feb. 1
and lost to Penn State. Saturday
and Sunday, the ski team will
travel to Roundtop to compete in

the last conference meet and
prep for the regional meet to be
held at Elk Mountain.

The winning team at the
regionals will receive an
expense-paid trip to Lake Placid,
N.Y. for the Nationals.

Morgan, 32, was competing in
the event held at Cortina

sled weighing 1,387 pounds when
occupied by the four-man team
and capable of reaching speeds of
80 mph down a five-foot wide
shoot.

A native of Saranac Lake,
N.Y., Morgan competed in the
1976 Winter Olympics at Inns-

All-American Bitzer Dexter ‘82 sets for the start of the winning

200-yd. medley relay Tuesday.

The Women’s Swimming team
handled a tough Bloomsburg
squad as easily as they had their
previous opponents this year,
defeating the Huskies 75-47 on
Tuesday to raise the team’s
record to a gaudy 9-2.

The Bloomsburg team suffered
only two defeats before invading
Freas-Rooke Pool, and boasted
talented Linda Smith — a five-
time All-American — aS its
strongest swimmer.

Kathy Frazier ’82, Bucknell’s
answer to Smith, had a hand in
four victories. She teamed with
Lisa Desrochers’84,Bitser Dexter
— also an All-American — and
Anna Carr ’84 to capture the 200-
yd. medly relay in 1:57.35.

Frazier also took the 100-yard
freestyle (54.52), 100-yd. fly and
50-yd. fly. Another multiple win-
ner was Nancy McGrath ’83 in the
100-yd. breaststroke and the 50-

Ice hockey rolls to 8-3-1 mark

By JEFF CROSS

While the loudest noise on
campus has been the clatter of
feet into Bertrand Library that
signals the start of a new
semester, the Ice Hockey Club
has been making a bang at its
home rink in Sunbury. The
Nukes have outscored opponents
108-40 in rolling to an 831
record and stand second in the
Susquehanna Valley Hocky
League with a 6-3 league mark.

The skaters recorded another
successful week with a 4-4 tie
with undefeated Dickinson Tues-
day, a 16-2 rout of Juniata Mon-
day and a 5-4 loss to league-
leading Sunbury Saturday.

Fired up by their impressive
victory over Juniata, Bucknell
travelled to Mechanicsburg
Tuesday to battle arch-rival
Dickinson in the renewal of the
Challenge Cup. Last year the
teams split 4-3 decisions before
deadlocking 7-7 in the rubber
match.

Before the boisterous Dickin-
son crowd, the Nukes quickly
took control and broke the ice

when Fid Speer ’80 took a pass
from Jeff Cross ’82 and blasted
a slap shot into the top corner of
the net. However the Red Devils
evened the contest less than a
minute later as the action con-
tinued fast and furious.

Bucknell retook the lead when
Bill Lightfoot ’82 scored off a
scramble in front of the Dickin-
son cage. High scoring center
Remi Johnson ’83 assisted on the
play.

In the middle of the period
Cross carried the puck over the
blue line, dropped a pass to
Speer who fed Stalio Boyd ’80
cutting in on the left side. Boyd
slid the puck under the Dickin-
son goalie to give the Nukes a
3-1 advantage.

The Red Devils narrowed the
Bucknell lead to 3-2 when Bruce
Cross scored on a break away
late in the first period.

The hard hitting continued in
the second period and both
teams had scoring chances
thwarted by fine goaltending or
watched their shots sail inches
wide of the nets. The Nukes
went up 4-2 midway through the
period when Ron Reynier ’82
blasted in a slap shot from the
left side. Johnson and flashy.
defenseman Paul Devlin ’83
received assists on the Bucknell
power play goal.

Again Dickinson battled back,
scoring twice more before the
end of the period to send the
teams to the locker rooms
deadlocked at 4-4.

Throughout the final 17
minutes the Nukes controlled
the play but couldn’t crack the
defensive wall set up by the Red
Devils. Meanwhile, defensemen
Devlin, Bill Grennon °82 and
Hugh Thornhill ’81 kept the
Dickinson forwards at bay.

As the clock ran down,
Bucknell continued to outcheck

and outskate the Red Devils in
scrapping for the game winner.
However an elbowing penalty to
leading scorer Jeff Kaighn 83
forced the Nukes to play short-
handed for the final minute,
preventing any further Bucknell
scoring opportunities. The
physical contest ended in a
hard-fought tie.

On Monday, Bucknell bombed
Juniata 16-2, scoring within a
minute of the start of each
period. Kaighn led the Nuke
scorers with four goals followed
by Devlin. and Grennon with
three, Cross with two and Boyd,
Johnson, Speer and Thornhill
with one each.

Goaltender Ron Borcherdt ’81
was outstanding in the nets,
delighting the Sunbury crowd
with dazzling kick saves.

The week opened with a 54
loss to Sunbury Saturday morn-
ing in a contest where Bucknell
outplayed the Suns in every
facet of the game except scor-
ing.

Trailing 4-0 entering the final
period, the Bucknell scoring
machine began to find the mark.
Goals by sophomores Johnson,
hard-hitting defenseman Chris
Rising and scrappy winger Dan
Fitzpatrick closed the gap to 4-3.

With five minutes left, Sun-
bury was awarded a controver-
sial penalty shot but Borcherdt
made a superb save. Sunbury
then came right back with an
apparent insurance goal with
two minutes left to play but the
Nukes never quit, with Kaighn
scoring in the final minute.

As in their 8-6 loss to the Suns
Jan. 19, Bucknell could not quite
‘overtake undefeated Sunbury,
thereby remaining second in the
league.

Bucknell faces off against Sus-
quehanna Saturday at 10 a.m.
and Sunbury Monday at 9:30
p.m. at the Sunbury Ice Rink.
The Nukes have beaten Sus-
quehanna 14-5, 6-2, and 8-1 this
year while all three of their
losses have been to Sunbury.

Women’s track shatters
records with 3-1 mark

By LADDIE WOOLLEY

The women’s indoor track team, with a 3-1 dual meet record, com-
peted in the Princeton Relays Saturday with no team scoring. But
Coach Diane Ware was “‘pleased”’ with the individual results, noting
“We now have two new school records and one more individual
qualifying for Easterns in addition to those who have already
qualified. I’d say that was good.”

Sophomore Julie Crossman qualified for the Eastern Champion-
ships in the two-mile with a time of 11:45. The one-mile relay team
of junior Co-captains Linda Accettura and Suzanne Hecker,
freshman Nancy Russo, and sophomore Laurie VanWyck qualified
for the EAIAW’s in 4:11.

The distance medley relay team of Accettura, Hecker, and
freshmen Debbie Passmore and Judy Olson also set a new team
record of 13:11.07. In the shot-put, Beth Bittel ’83 placed sixth out of
approximately 20 teams with a throw of 12.04 meters.

The track team participated in two dual meets, in January, one
here at the Sports/Recreation Complex versus Georgetown and
Hartwick, and the other away at Delaware with George Mason
University.

The home meet was a triumphant one, as Bucknell swept to first
place in nine of the 14 events while amassing 83 team points.
Georgetown was a distant second with 47 points and Hartwick only
managed to score six.

Promising freshman sprinter Russo dashed to a 7.6 win in the 60
yard dash and also captured the 220 (28.1) and the long jump (15’
942”").

Lonnie Fertik ’83 had victories in the high jump (5’4%2”) and the
60-meter hurdles (9.6), to further demonstrate her prowess in both
track and field, and placed second in the shot put (34’11”’). For-
tunately for Bucknell, Fertik’s teammate, Bittel, won the shot put
with a heave of 40’1042”’.

Accettura won the 800-meter run, and Bucknell was also victorious
in the 880-yard relay, the one-mile relay, and finished second in the
two-mile relay.

At Delaware, the women won three events but faced a powerful
George Mason team which swiped the other ten to win the meet by
scoring 72 points to Bucknell’s 54. The Bisons placed second in the
tri-meet, defeating Delaware by the score of 78-56.

Winners for the Bison were Crossman in the 5,000-meter run
(19:26.4), Bittel in the shotput (39’2’’) and Russo in the long jump.

Other qualifiers for the Eastern Championships include Fertik in
the high jump, 60-meter hurdles, and pentathlon; Laura Gaydos ’83,

Men’s swim streak stop

ped at three by Penn State

By BRIAN FETTERHOFF

Riding the crest of a three meet
unbeaten streak, the men’s swim team,
ranked twelfth in the East, met Penn
State, the East’s sixth ranked team,
Wednesday in Freas-Rooke Pool. When the
waves had settled, the Nittany Lions had
emerged with a narrow 58.5 - 54.5 decision.

Prior to the Penn State meet, the Bisons
recorded wins over Rutgers, Lafayette
and Drexel for a 6-2 record, leaving them
in excellent position to snare the East
Coast Conference championship.

In the opening race of the Penn State
meet, Bucknell’s 400-yd medley relay

captured first and third.

Jenkins, with a 1:44.63 in the 200
freestyle, and Schulte, with a 2:00.17 in the
200 individual medley, gained impressive
victories. Wakely (1:55.61 in the 200 but-
terfly), Dougherty (48:88 in the 100
freestyle) and sophomore Mark Bongiorno
(2:00.17 in the 200 backstroke) posted their
best individual times of the year.

Prior to a lopsided 86-26 trouncing of
Lafayette, Bucknell dunked Rutgers at
home by a score of 76-37, as the Bisons wen
10 of 13 events, dropping only the 200 in-
dividual medley, the 200 yd. backstroke,
and the 400 yd. freestyle relay.

In their section of the
Princeton Relays in Princeton,
N.J. Sunday, the distance
medley relay team of Bigotto,
Hulme and freshmen Mike
Geraghty and Bill Reifsnyder
placed second while Sayre was
second in the 3,000 meter run.

The two-mile relay team of
Bigotto, Hulme, Doug Pickell ’82
and Jeff Hines ’83 finished fifth,
as did sophomore Ted Lewis in
the triple jump.

Martin Carter stole the show by

Cagers post third straight
in road upset at Lafayette

By DAVE KIRKPATRICK and
MARK MITCHELL

After a month of frustration, the men’s
basketball team has apparently turned
itself around, and Wednesday night’s
56-53 win over Lafayette put the Bisons
right back in the thick of the East Coast
Conference Western Division title race.

The win was far from easy as the
Breakin’ Bisons had to overcome a five-
point Lafayette lead at halftime. Down the
stretch Bucknell went continuously to cap-
tain Al Leslie ’81 who responded by pump-
ing in 17 second half points. Leslie finished
with 26 points, but as is often the case in
the big games, it was the unsung players
who picked up the big buckets at the end of
the game.

The Wednesday night heroes faced a 53-
50 deficit with only 55 seconds remaining
but unlike the early season frustrations
with the final minutes of play, this time the
last minute belonged to Bucknell.

Guard Paul Adkins ’81, who has
established himself as the team’s premier
play-maker, turned scorer with a 20-foot
jumper to pull the team within one point.
After Bucknell called a time out, Adkins
and Dave Shehadi ’81 came up with a steal
off the full court pressure, and Shehadi’s
driving layup gave Bucknell the lead at 54-
53 with 25 seconds remaining.

Lafayette’s last ditch effort to pull out a
victory fell short when Jim Whitman miss-
ed a long jumper and 6-7 junior Deb
Okorodudu snared his game-high ninth re-
bound. Okorodudu was immediately foul-
ed, and despite a Lafayette timeout and
the deafening din created by the Leopard
faithful, Okorodudu sank both free throws

to give Bucknell the final 56-53 margin.

The win meant a continuation of a
modest three game win streak that has
propelled Bucknell back into the chase for
western division title. The streak began
with a 62-55 overtime victory Feb. 4 over
Rider — the current leader of the division
— and included a 54-44 defeat of Lehigh
Saturday, in Bethlehem.

Senior Mike Page played a big role in
each of the wins, scoring 15 against Rider
and 16 against Lehigh, both team highs.

Leslie added 13 points in the Rider win,
and Okorodudu had 10 points, nine re-
bounds, and a career high four blocked
shots. Okorodudu has blocked 16 shots in
the last eight games, and leads the ECC
with a 1.3 average.

Against Lehigh, Okorodudu had 12 points
and 11 rebounds, while Leslie had 10 points
and Ray Moss ’83 had 10 points and 13 re-
bounds.

Leslie now stands within five points of the
career scoring record of Bob Barry, ’80
and is within nine free throws of the career
record for that category.

January was a month of frustration for
the Bisons. The first Bucknell win in the
conference didn’t come until the Delaware
match Jan. 28. Leslie had 18 points against
the Blue Hens including six free throws
down the stretch to spark the 51-45
triumph.

The next time out the Bisons turned
hapless West Chester into winners for the
first time this season, falling 84-75.
Bucknell had a season high 24 turnovers

and Franklin & Marshall 25-17 to improve its record to
5-7.

Head Coach Robert Ferraro had only praise for his
team. ‘“‘As a whole the team wrestled very well. Steve
Greenly ’82, John Stoner ’82 and Doug Mays 81 were ex-
ceptional,”’ he said.

Captain Mays and Stoner rewrote the record books as
they recorded the fastest pins in Bucknell history—126
and 167 pounds respectively. Mays walked off the mat
victorious after only 45 seconds while Stoner took just 67
seconds to dispose of his Rutgers opponent.

The Bisons registered three other pins in the meet, as
Greenly nailed down both his opponents while Mark

With Saturday’s double win, the Bisons have regained
their winning ways after coming off a very competitive
January. In a five-day tour of the south, they lost to
William & Mary 2418, East Carolina 22-18, North
Carolina State 31-9 and Navy 41-10. NC State and Navy
are ranked in the top 20 in the nation.

Coach Ferraro said the team performed well consider-
ing the competition, and pointed out as the highlight
Greenly’s match against the defending national cham-
pion at NC State, to whom Greenly lost by a single
point.

Returning home, the Bisons downed Lycoming 30-15
Jan. 20 and Colgate 24-19 Feb. 4. Sandwiched between

the two wins, Bucknell travelled to West Chester along
with Hofstra and Drexel for a four-team competition to

Bucknell emerged victorious over Hofstra 28-11 but
lost to Drexel 25-14 and West Chester 22-14.

Mays, at 126 pounds, and Greenly, alternating be-
tween the 177 and 190 pound classes, both won all three
of their matches. Both Mays and Greenly now sport 16-4
overall records.

Baker earned two wins — one each at 177 and 190 —
and Wally Zimmerman ’83 had a win and a draw at 142.

¢1,106 tuition increase

By BILL THUM

NEW YORK—The Executive Commit-
tee of the University Board of Trustees
voted unanimously late Thursday night to
approve a $1106 increase in tuition and fees
for the 1981-82 academic year.

The decision, arrived at during a five-
hour meeting at the University Club here,
officially ended the six-month debate on
the tuition question.

The trustees had little problem sup-
porting the 15.2 percent increase—the
largest in the University’s history—but
heatedly debated the distribution of the
funds. The debate centered on either sup-
porting large increases in wage and salary
totals or the possibility of increasing
undergraduate student aid, University
President Dennis O’Brien said.

Although the 15th alternative to the
budget provided a 14.5 percent increase in
faculty compensation, Chairman of the

Faculty salaries increase 15%

Faculty David Ray and Chairman of the
University Committee on Planning and the
Budget, Stephen Becker, called for an ad-
ditional 1 percent hike, citing last year’s
inequities and soaring inflation, Ray said.
Interest in increasing student aid was
the result of many trustees’ fears that
Bucknell would “become an elitist institu-
tion’? due to such large tuition increases
and President Reagan’s announcement of
federal budget cuts in the area of private
education, trustee Jane Maas 53 said.
Although financial aid currently affects
only 26 percent of the student body,
University Provost Wendell Smith said a
like increase in aid in relation to the fee
hike will prevent Bucknell from falling
back on financial aid. Also, while Bucknell

when the University put the house on probation.

has in the past been criticized for the low
level of federal aid it receives, this situa-
tion will cushion the effects of Reagan’s
policies. Only $245,000 out of $27 million
budget represents federal student aid
grants now, Zeller said.

Concerning faculty salaries, the trustees
recognized Bucknell faculty were serious-
ly underpaid last year and that—in addi-
tion to the across the board increases to
off-set inflation—a larger catch-up was
needed to improve morale, O’Brien said.
In this light, the trustees moved to in-
crease faculty compensation by 5% per-
cent to 15 percent.

This represents the same increase as
proposed by the faculty during their

Although faculty compsnsation was in-
creased, an additional increase was not
made in the comprehensive fee, Ray said.
“This will put pressure on Zeller to keep an
already extremely tight budget in the
black,” Ray said. This will be especially
difficult considering the needs of replacing
the student medical director and purchase
of a new word processor, among other
things which have not been accounted for,
Zeller said.

Reaction of the trustees was subdued but
positive. Trustee David Trout said
although the increase in tuition and fees is
high, “it is not out of line with our frame of
reference schools and it begins to correct
the inequities of last year’s budget.”
Trustee Beverly Dunston ’52 said the most
important part of any academic institution
is the maintenance of a strong faculty, and

Two fraternity chapters here

The action against the two

the heels of the formulation ofa

itiated,’ Commerford said. He
said fraternities exist at Bucknell
at the invitation of the University
and as a group must obey the
rules of proper conduct establish-
ed by the University in the Stu-
dent handbook.

He said the new policy is an ef-
fective way to penalize a group
for their collective misconduct
and is aimed not only at frater-
nities but applies to all student
organizations.

Both fraternities have been
prohibited from keeping beer on
tap from Monday thru Thursday

See FRATERNITIES, page 6.

The proposed contract is a “simple straight-

with the University at a negotiating session last
month, according to Vice President for Administra-
tion and Finance John Zeller.

The University drafted a contract for the group,
and at this stage, the employees are expected to for-
mally ratify or reject the agreement.

The officers have failed to accept or reject the
pact formally, however, and the University ‘can do
nothing but sit tight’’ in the meantime, Zeller said
He added that he will ‘assume we have a contract
unti} they tell us we don’t.” y

The officers are not in any hurry to reach a con-
tractural agreement, however, and such an
assumption might not be valid. According to
Roberts, “Bucknell’s in a hurry; the union’s in a
hurry. We’re not.” He said he expects the negotia-
tions to continue.

Roberts has been sitting in on the negotiations

between the union and the University as the securi-

forward contract”? which involves “strictly wages
and benefits” according to Zeller. He said he could
not discuss its specific provisions until a contract is
ratified.

One of the requests the officers made was for an
hourly pay rate of $7.50 per hour for day patrolmen,
Roberts said Thursday. They are currently paid
$4.90 per hour, with a 15 cent hourly increment for
night patrols.

Roberts said the officers also asked for the right
to carry handguns, and for the training to use them.
They also asked for a ‘‘firearms policy” because
“when you get a call you don’t know what’s there till
you get there.”

Because the officers want to carry guns does not
mean they want to act like “cowboys” or to “play
cops” Roberts said. He stressed that Campus
Security is a service for students, but said their

Trustees increase the

student activities fee

from $46 to $52

By LAURA CARMELICH

An ABS proposal to raise the
Student Activities Fee from $46 to
$52 was approved by the Ex-
ecutive Committee of the Univer-
sity Board of Trustees in New
York Thursday night.

The recommendation was
presented to the trustees at the
close of Thursday’s meeting by
ABS President Michael Suarez
»g2, and the trustees asked no
questions after Suarez’s brief
presentation. They gave their
unanimous approval immediate-
ly.

Suarez said the increase in the
fee was warranted and that he
had anticipated no problems in
receiving approval from the com-
mittee.

The ABS Congress voted 18-3 at
its Wednesday night meeting to
ask for the $6 increase—the first
hike in the Student Activities Fee
in four years.

The increase will help provide
an “improvement in the quality
of activities” at Bucknell, as well
as create “viable social alter-
natives to fraternity functions,”
Suarez said. There presently ex-
ists a “tyranny of non-choice”’ on
campus and Suarez added ‘“‘we
are hoping money will make
more choice.’

The allocation of the $46 fee
presently paid by every student is
as follows: $5 to the Financial
Aid Office to be applied to a
special scholarship fund, $1 to the
Office of Student Activities, $1 to
the Committee on Student Pro-
grams, and $1 to each class. The
remaining $38 is distributed to all
other campus organizations and
events which serve the Bucknell
community.

The allotment of $5to the Finan-
cial Aid scholarships will con-
tinue, although the ABS Congress
decided at its meeting Wednes-
day to set up a task force to ex-
amine the distribution of these
scholarships by the Financial Aid
Office.

The ABS now has no say in the
criteria for or the selection of the
recipients of these scholarships.

The Office of Student Activities
and COSP will also continue to
receive $1 each from every stu-
dent’s activity fee, while the
amount given to each class will
be raised from $1 to $2. According
to Suarez, if class activities were
organized properly and aided by
these additional funds, they could
help create the ‘“‘sense of com-
munity” the ABS would like to
promote at Bucknell.

In addition to boosting the quali-
ty of student life, the increased
fee will be used as a type of back-
up fund for the ABS Reserve
Account, he said. The ABS erases
any debts acquired by student
organizations at the end of each
year.

The cost of absorbing these
debts varies from year to year,
however, and cannot be accurate-
ly predicted, according to Suarez.
For instance, last year the Con-
cert Committee had an unusually
unsuccessful season that left
them with a $16,000 debt which
the ABS had to absorb.

Suarez admits that “‘in a way”
anticipating these debts leads to
“padding” the Reserve Account.
But he feels such a safety valve is
“very, very necessary.”

Suarez has been quick to point
out that while the additional
funds are necessary to keep pace
with the increase in Bucknell’s
social alternative organizations
and their rising service costs,
money is “only part of the solu-
tion.”

By adopting a stricter attitude
toward groups who run over their
budgets and by charging club
dues to organizations that do not
provide a service to the Universi-
ty, Suarez said he hopes to ‘“‘keep
waste to a minimum.” In this
way ABS funds may be used
more efficiently and — he hopes
— “more creatively.”

The former lounge in Vedder Hall shown above is one of four the Office of Residential Life
has had converted into additional double rooms in order to alleviate a housing shortage
caused this semester—allegedly by a decrease in the number of students studying off-

campus.

Overcrowded dormitories result of
fewer students studying off-campus

by JAN BALAKIAN

The Office of Residential Life has been forced to
convert lounges into rooms to accommodate an in-
crease in the number of students on campus this
semester.

In response to greater requests for residential
hall space, Associate Director of Residential Life
Gerald Commerford has converted four lounges in
Vedder Hall and one lounge in Swartz Hall into
double rooms. Although there were originally 36
extra room requests, the loss of December
graduates and the attrition which normally occurs
in the spring semester has compensated for the re-
mainder of the extra requests, Commerford said.

“T reluctantly made the decision to use the
lounges and I will accommodate the students af-
fected by my decision as soon as there are rooms
available,”’ he said.

Part of the problem stems from a decline in the
number of students who normally study off-
campus during second semester. University
Registrar Bruce Freed said 93 students studied
off-campus last semester while only 58 are doing
so this semester. This represents a significant
decline from the 114 students who studied off-
campus during second semester last year, Freed
said.

Associate Dean of the College of Arts and

Sciences John Pyper said a trip to London and
Athens was proposed last spring for this semester.
However, the University Committee on Planning
and the Budget concluded that it was not approved
in time to be included in this year’s budget, Pyper
said. The proposal for this program recommended
that 45 additional students be involved in off-
campus study.

Enrollment has not been a factor in the lack of
rooms, Freed said. The enrollment for
undergraduates this semester is 3118, a decrease
from the 3130 students of last semester. This
decrease is off-set by the number of students stu-
dying off-campus which brings campus enroll-
ment to 3037 this semester as compared to 3060 for
last semester. This represents no significant in-
crease from the enrollment total of 3005
undergraduates for second semester of last year,
Freed said.

Director of Residential Life Brenda Gordon said
a similar shortage of housing was confronted in
1972 when Bucknell needed 185 extra beds. The
solution then was the construction of Bucknell
West. However,'now there is no prospect for a
new dormitory, Gordon said. “Right now we are
trying to maintain and improve the quality of what
we have. We are not financially capable of
building a new dorm,” Gordon said.

Trees are victims of

student vandalism

Juvenile behavior sharply criticized

Ten trees worth a total of $328 have
tions on campus since Christmas,

been vandalized at various loca-
according to Physical Plant

Grounds Foreman George Trutt.

Acting Chief of Security Michael Amarante said the cause of the
destruction:is swinging and pulling on the fragile saplings, which
range in age from 1 to 5 years. Since the vandalism usually occurs at
night, it is difficult to determine who is involved, Amarante said.

If caught destroying the trees, the suspect is prosecuted for criminal
mischief by the University in conjunction with Lewisburg District
Magistrate Leo Armbruster, Amarante said. The penalties include
replacement costs of the tree, court fees and a fine. Kappa Sigma
fraternity members were involved in a similar case involving a
Lewisburg citizen’s evergreen tree in late December. (See story on
page 1.)

The destruction of trees is a perennial problem at Bucknell and in-
curs an estimated annual cost of $1000, Trutt said.
some especially when you consider the costs involved in planting and
maintaining the trees in addition to those of replacement,” he said.

Vice President for Administration and Finance John Zeller said
such destructive behavior usually stems from drunkenness. Trutt said
the vandalism represents a form of “childish, expensive fun.”

Nine other young saplings in addition to this one—planted in front of the Olin Science Building
and across the street from the new computer center—have been snapped and destroyed since
Christmas vacation. Students swinging on the trees has been attributed as the cause.

Times to publish guide to colleges

They hope to compete with Yale’s ‘Insider’s Guide to Colleges’

By MARY LISA MURGIANO
The New York Times has solicited 25 University
students through the office of Secretary of the University
William Weist to help them compile a guide to colleges
and universities.
The New York Times Guide to Colleges” will include
short essays on approximately 225 schools including

Bucknell. The book is intended to help high school’

students choose the “right” college.

According to Times Education Editor Edward B. Fiske,
there is a need for a “comprehensive” college guide that
will help students to differentiate between schools. ‘‘Our
assumption is that selecting a college is a matching pro-
cess. No school is right for everyone,” Fiske said.

Fiske contacted Weist and requested that a ‘“‘represen-
tative sample” of students be chosen to complete ques-
tionnaires about the University. The responses are being
collected and will be edited and included in the guide.

According to Weist, the questionnaires were supposed to
be distributed during the semester while all students were
on campus and a “representative sample” could be
selected. However, the mailing arrived late in December,
after students had left campus.

Weist said the surveys were distributed during January
to a group of students selected by Assistant Director of
Annual Giving Robert Kallin and Philip Andrews 81. The
Times requested that students with varying majors,
grades and interests be selected, Weist said.

Andrews says he is not sure whether it was wise for the
Times to solicit students through an administrator who
could control which students responded. According to An-
drews, he played a major role in selecting students only
because he was personally acquainted with Weist.

“There is a danger in choosing people who tend to be
like you,” Andrews said.

Fiske said the selection procedure was ‘‘deliberately
vague” in order to accommodate all schools and “‘not im-
pose any more than was necessary.”

The survey consisted of 50 questions, and respondents
were asked to describe the strength of academic depart-
ments, the variety of course offerings, the workload, cam-
pus social life and the atmosphere of the cafeteria, in addi-

tion to other aspects of the University.

The last questions dealt with the “sort of student’”’ who
“should come” to a particular school and which ones
“should go elsewhere.”

Other subjective questions asked if there were any ways
“in which your college does not fit its popular image” and
if the respondent would “‘come again.”

Andrews and Weist agreed the questionnaire was “‘fair”’
and was designed to be taken seriously. ‘It was a profes-
sional questionnaire,” Weist said.

According to Andrews, “It was a well-constructed
survey that will probably paint a broad but accurate pic-
ture. It was very open-ended. They didn’t load or slant the
questions.”

Weist compared the Times guide to “The Comparative
Guide to American Colleges” and ‘‘The Insider’s Guide to
the Colleges 1981-82.” The Insider’s guide, compiled by
the Yale Daily News, ‘began as a fun project but ended by
degrading some schools,” he said.

Andrews predicts that the Times guide will not be ‘‘as
dry as Barron’s Profiles. It is informative but not flippant
like Yale’s and will probably be similar to a New York
Times editorial,” he said.

Fiske contrasted the Times guide with Yale’s Insider’s
guide, Barron’s “Profiles of American Colleges’ and
Lovejoy’s ‘College Guide.” “We feel that although the
Yale guide is good, it is perhaps not as systematic as it

could be. Our guide is similar to Yale’s in that it tries to
distinguish between schools and their suitability for
various types of students.”

Fiske added that Barron’s and Lovejoy’s are written as
encyclopedias whereas the Times guide will be more
“comprehensive and descriptive.”

Yale’s “Insider’s Guide to Colleges” describes the
University as ‘‘more or less a professional, Establishment
school for nice kids from nice families who will do almost
anything to land a job with a good company and precious
little to de anything else of value.” The article was written
by Alan Levine ’80, the only student who submitted a writ-
ten contribution to the editors of the guide.

“The New York Times Guide to Colleges”’ is scheduled
to be published in July.

Trustees conclude first stage
of presidential assessment

By LISA CERUTI
The Commission on Presidential Assessment, an
ad hoc committee of the University’s Board of
Trustees, has concluded the first stage of its review
and assessment of University President Dennis

O’Brien’s first five years here.

Members of the committee met here last weekend
and the weekend of Jan. 23-24 to conduct interviews
with members of the administration, faculty and

student body concerning their

Last fall, Vice Chairman of the Board and Chair-
man of the Assessment Committee Samuel Woolley
invited the faculty and administration to submit

“input” on O’Brien’s review.

The committee has received information through
interviews and written statements from 101 people.
Woolley said that — in his committee’s request for
evaluation — they asked that respondents concen-
trate on four major areas of assessment. The areas

are leadership, decision-making,
and suggestions for the future.

to Woolley.

Florence Pyle, secretary for the committee, said
the group is now beginning to compile the informa-
tion they have collected. ‘‘Their next step is to draft
a preliminary report and discuss it with the Presi-
dent,’’ Pyle said.

Woolley said his committee will meet with O’Brien
to review the report and make any necessary
clarifications. The final report will then be
presented at the biannual meeting of the Board of
Trustees in May in New York City.

According to Woolley, “Things are going ex-
tremely well. We’re right on schedule and will pro-
ceed as planned.

Students participating in the assessment pro-

organizations. These groups include student

sororities, athletic teams, resident assistants, the
Black Student Alliance and the Bucknellian staff.

Organization formed to help promote
responsible campus drinking habits

By M.E. WEIL

An organization concerned
with “responsible drinking and
awareness of alcohol use’ has
been formed by Stuart Flavell ’81
and Director of Residential Life
Brenda Gordon.

Members of ‘Students Con-
cerned for Responsible Drink-
ing” include representatives of

based partly in principle. ‘‘They
ask me to answer these calls but
they don’t trust me with a gun,”
Roberts said.

The patrolmen have ‘‘never
considered going on strike’ if
their contractual demands are
not met, because they ‘can’t af-
ford to,” Roberts said.

Instead, they are relyi:

and also on the advice of an
torney whose service they have
hired. Roberts would not identify
the name of the law firm which he
said was representing the of-
ficers.

The University has also retain-
ed legal advice, and has hired the
New York law firm of Jackson,
Lewis, Schnitzler and Crupman
to assist in its dealing with the
UPGWA and the officers.

The attorney for the officers
was retained because they
wanted “independent counsel” in

Others have reported that the
officers have had a “falling out”
with the union officials, however,
and that this is the reason for the

The group is modeled after
“Boost Alcohol Consciousness

sity Students” (BACCHUS), a na-
tional organization which pro-
motes alternatives to drinking.

According to Flavell, the
organization encotrages ‘‘re-
sponsible drinking,” which he
defines as limiting consumption
of alcohol, drinking slowly, being
aware of alcohol content and
avoiding skilled tasks such as
driving while intoxicated.

The group recognizes that
“drinking is a social device and
there should be an alternative.
We are not a _ goody-goody

Beth Sipple ’82, a member of
the organization, said the group
plans to initiate an ‘‘Alcohol

dition to other activities.

According to Sipple, the group
is run primarily by students.
“Residential Life advises us but
prefers that the organization con-

returns for second time

The Class of 53 Lectureship—which two years ago brought Dan
Rather and other high officials of CBS to the University—will
return for a second time beginning next week with another media-
oriented series of speaking engagements titled “Messages from the
Medium.”

The first speakers in the program will be NBC Vice Chairman
Richard Slanat and former CBS Vice Chairman and President
Frank Stanton, who will speak in the University Center Forum at
8:30 p.m. Thursday on “Independence vs. Responsibility: Thoughts
on Management.”

The two media kingpins will also participate in an open
classroom for University students and a news conference for the
local press Friday.

Three other two-day programs have also been scheduled as the
other components of ‘Messages from the Medium.’’ Diane Healey,
the vice president for affiliated relations operations at the NBC
Television Network, and Lorraine Wallace, an artist and writer
who is married to CBS News correspondent Mike Wallace, will be
on campus March 10 and 11.

CBS News correspondent and ‘‘Morning”’ anchorman Charles
Kuralt and ‘60 Minutes” commentator Andy Rooney will appear in
the second and third weeks of April.

Salant—the former president of CBS News—has been the driv-
‘ng force behind the acquisition of guests for both the first and se-
cond programs of the 53 Lectureship, according to Dean of Arts and
Sciences Robert Chambers.

CA retreat strives
to improve listening

By BILL THUM

Concern and Action’s alternative to Colloquy will be presented next
weekend in a retreat focusing on improving personal relationships at
Bucknell’s conference center in Cowan.

The retreat will focus on the problem expressed by students of the
superficiality of many relationships and difficulty in dealing with
others in-an emotional and physical way, according to student coor-
dinators Katie Foster ’81 and Helen Roby ’82. Differing from the collo-
quy format—which used lectures on a specific topic over a several day
period—the retreat will allow students to take time off from campus to
explore one area in depth, Roby said.

The retreat will focus on expanding communication through the
development of listening skills using a local expert in the field as a
guide, Foster said.

CA has arranged for Charles E. Confer ’59, a professional social
worker at the Institute for the Development of Life Skills, Inc., to work
with the group to develop listening skills. ‘Confer, who received his
master’s degree in social work at the University of Pittsburgh, works
as a consultant for businesses and other organizations to develop ef-
fective communication skills, Roby said. ‘‘A lot of people think they
listen, but could learn to communicate more effectively,” said Confer.
“The key is in learning to put oneself aside and focus on understanding
and accepting what is going on inside another person.”’

The program is scheduled to leave campus Friday afternoon and
return Saturday evening with the majority of the time to be spent in
relaxing interaction, Foster said. “Hopefully, this will set a precedent
for future off-campus retreats that can focus on unlimited topics such
as religion, the handicapped and minorities,” said CA President Steve
Kushner ’82.

While the idea of Colloquy, currently in its 13th year, is not being
abandoned, new needs have arisen which must be attacked in a much
more personal level, Foster said. Assistant Director of Student Ac-
tivities and University Center Programs Ruth Burnham said she was
pleased with the direction CA is taking and “there can’t be enough
done to help people in their personal relationships.”

Registration for the weekend closes Monday afternoon.

A blood shortage in this area is
making it crucial to collect 300

There are few qualifications for

than 110 pounds and be in good
health. Students may sign up in

responsibilities for their actions
when acting as a group,’’ Com-
merford said.

Kappa Sig received a warning
from the University in October
following an incident where a
pledge was hospitalized after
escessive alcohol consumption on
the eve of his initiation into the
fraternity, according to Paul
Williams ’82, the fraternity’s
president.

The decision to place Kappa Sig
on probation followed an incident
where eight members cut down
an evergreen tree on the property
of Dr. George Miller of
Lewisburg. The brothers were
foraging for a Christmas tree to
decorate the chapter house,
Williams said.

Williams said he knew Kappa
Sig was a “‘short step” away from
probation because Commerford
had told him the University was
“scared to death’’ after the drink-
ing occurrence in October. Com-
merford said the incident was
viewed as ‘‘fraternity-
encouraged drinking’’ but
Williams said the pledge ‘‘took it
upon himself to get that drunk.”
He said the chapter members
were ‘definitely wrong” to cut
down the tree, however.

Williams accepted responsibili-
ty for their actions and was fined
$625 and cited for criminal
mischief by Lewisburg
Magistrate Leo Armbruster. But
Williams said the fraternity paid
the cost.

Bomb scare

TKE’s warning stemmed from
“trashing” a floor in Roberts
Hall, according to President
Steve Riggins ’82. A group of
TKE brothers, searching for a
bronze plaque stolen from the ex-
terior of the house, found it on 3%
Roberts and vandalized the hall,
as retribution, spewing trash on
the floor and turning over beds,
he said.

A complaint was lodged
against TKE with the Office of
Residential Life and Commer-
ford put the fraternity ‘‘on warn-
ing.” Probation followed when
members again caused damage
in Roberts following their ‘‘Pop-
Son Night’’ celebration.
Members of the group returned
the next morning to clean up and
replace three broken windows,
Riggins said.

Riggins said further
disciplinary action by the
University against TKE was war-
ranted but that probation was
“perhaps too harsh.” “Because
we were among the first, we were
made an example,” he said.

Commerford said he has ‘‘con-
fidence in the leadership’”’ of the
two fraternities that the limita-
tions of the probation will be
adhered to. He said he does not
think the social restrictions will
be detrimental to either fraterni-
ty. And, while Williams and Rig-
gins agreed the probation limits
would be an “inconvenience,”
neither said he thought it would
affect fraternity morale.

clears Hunt

A telephoned bomb threat this morning caused University officials
to order the evacuation of Hunt Hall at 11 o’clock.
A spokesman for Vice President for Administration and Finance

John Zeller said an anonymous caller telephoned the physical plant
director’s office at about 10:50 am and said there was a bomb in the
dormitory. She said officials did not expect any difficulty with the
evacuation since many of the dorm residents were in classes. A
similar threat was received a few weeks ago.

The building was evacuated and a search made, but no bomb was
found.

Lewisburg Borough Police were called this morning to assist with
the evacuation and bomb search.

ABS retreat attended by
less than half of congress

The Association of Bucknell Students’seminar on leadership, held
Friday and Saturday at the conference center at Cowan, was attended
by 18 congress members—less than half of the organization.

The seminar, entitled ‘‘People Support What They Help Create,”’
was intended to outline the ‘‘new” congress and its team structure
while developing awareness of the University community from ad-
ministrative, academic and social perspectives, ABS President
Michael Suarez ’82 said.

Friday evening was devoted to discussions concerning the Universi-
ty and goals of the “new” ABS. Saturday was spent in group discus-
sions with University administrators to increase rapport with students
and knowledge of the University in general, Suarez said.

After the discussion period, the congress members regrouped to
study the concepts of ‘team building” and “brainstorming” with
Assistant Director of Student Activities and University Center Pro-
grams Ruth Burnham. Suarez said the team system and brainstorm-
ing sessions will be an integral part of his administration.

The major outcomes of the weekend included plans to increase
publicity on the situation of the third floor of the University Center, in-
crease social alternatives on campus and increase the Student Ac-
tivities Fee by $6 to $52. (See story on page 3.)

Although officially terming the weekend a success, Suarez said a
review of the retreat will be presented on Wednesday to the 23 con-
gress members unable to attend the seminar.

thus the salary hike ‘was a
very positive step in maintaining
the academic quality of
Bucknell.”

Faculty reaction was mixed.
Ray said he was pleased with the
board’s decision, largely because
it is a positive jesture to improve
morale at the University. Becker,
however, still said more needed
to be done to correct past inequity
and thus was not impressed by

the board’s efforts.

Although tuition and fees re-
mained largely the same from
the last proposal, the breakdown
of funds was altered at the
meeting, Zeller said. The tuition
increase will drop from $950 to
$900 while the room fee will in-
crease by $50 for a total of $100.
The board increase will stay at
$100, Zeller said.

Thus, while tuition was actual-
ly decreased at the meeting, total
comprehensive charges remain-

ed the same.

In addition to increasing the
tuition, the board decided,
without debate, to increase the
student activities fee as ABS
president Michael Suarez ’82 re-
quested. This will bring total in-
creases to $1106 or $8437 in com-
prehensive charges for 1981-82.
Suarez said the trustees were
very receptive to student in-
terests and showed a great con-
cern for the continuation of quali-
ty education at Bucknell.

Pope gives homily
on human rights

Pope John Paul II gave a homi-
ly on human rights Tuesday in
Manila’s presidential palace, his
host President Ferdinand Marcos
seated beside him.

Marcos, who is preparing for
the upcoming presidential elec-
tion, ended more than eight years
of martial law a month ago. The
Pope praised the action as a good
sign.

The Pope emphasized that
“joint effort of all the citizens
builds a truly sovereign nation,”
and urged “a spirit of mutual
respect and civic responsibility.”

A large group of cabinet
members, judges, dignitaries
and political associates of the
president made up the audience.
None of the political opposition or
people who held political office
prior to martial law were pres-
ent.

The Pope also visited Karachi,
Pakistan Monday. Twenty
minutes before he reached the
stadium where he said mass, a
grenade exploded in a reviewing
stand, killing the man holding it
and wounding three people near-
by. Police would not give details
about the man or who his target
may have been.

No obstacles found
in Iran agreement

No substantial legal obstacles
regarding the carrying out of the
terms negotiated with Iran for
the release of the 52 American
hostages have been found, ac-
cording to the Reagan Ad-
ministration interagency com-
mittee.

The committee review, which
took one month to complete, was
sent to the White House last
weekend for final discussion by
President Reagan and a Cabinet-
level group. Officials said while
the Reagan Administration is un-
comfortable with some parts of

the complex agreement that
secured the hostages’ release
Jan. 20, it is expected to approve
it

The completion of the review
coincided with the opening of
Congressional hearings on the
Iran crisis and the terms of the
agreement Wednesday.

Polish leader meets
with East German

Polish Communist Party
leader Stanislaw Kania met with
East German leader Erich
Honeder Tuesday for talks that
included ‘‘certain international
problems of the two countries’
foreign policies,” according to
the Polish press agency.

This visit followed a meeting
Sunday between Kania and
Gustav Husak, the Czecho-
slovakian leader.

The meetings have been
regarded as an effort by the
Polish leaders to assure the allied
party leaders that Warsaw
authorities have the situation
concerning the recent Polish
Trade Union movements under
control.

Reagan announces
new economic plan

President Reagan urged a new
economic program that would cut
the size and change the shape of
government programs enacted in
the past twenty years.

In a televised speech to Con-
gress Wednesday night, Reagan
proposed a 10 percent tax cut for
1982 and budget cuts totaling
$41.4 billion in 83 major pro-
grams. The only area where an
increase was suggested was in
the defense budget.

Reagan issued a challenge to
those who might criticize the
drastic cuts. ‘‘Have they an alter-
native which offers a greater
chance of balancing the budget,
reducing and eliminating infla-
tion, stimulating the creation of
jobs and reducing the tax
burden?” he asked.

New auto industry
rebates announced

The General Motors Corpora-

for help from automobile dealers.

General Motors’ payments
began that day and will continue
until March 19. Payments range
from $500 to $700 and apply to in-
termediate model cars.

The Ford rebate program
began Thursday and will run un-
til March 21, with amounts up to
10 percent off the list price of
most midsize and large cars.

In the real world

You can’t put your feet on the coffee table at home or Mom will
scold you, but you can do it here and you smile and you’re
glad—there’s no one to yell and it’s kind of fun.

In fact, sometimes it’s so much fun that we try to see just how
much we can get away with and how enjoyable it can be. We steal
and vandalize the property of others but it’s alright—this is only col-
lege—not the real world.

Like hell it isn’t.

Because our perceptions of collegiate morality are often dif-
ferent from common standards of decency the University now
threatens us with criminal prosecution for campus vandalism. Stu-
dent organizations are now faced with the possibility of University
retribution—probation, suspension, exclusion and even loss of
recognition—for behavioral misconduct.

It’s a shame we have to be reminded that we’re college students
and not a pack of wanton, wild wolves. The University is justified in
designing a new policy to combat and penalize group misbehavior,
put it is unfair to the students if the administration serves as judge
and jury in these disciplinary matters.

To obtain a balance of opinion, student input is necessary in this
decision making process. A special student committee should be for-
mulated by the ABS to aid the University in the decision whether to
punish and how to penalize. There should not be a blanket penalty for
a plethora of different offenses.

After all, that’s not how justice is accomplished in the real
world.

Assessments

It is not very often that this university or any other has a presi-
dent that will request an extensive evaluation of his administrative
performance before agreeing to head the school.

But that is exactly what Dennis O’Brien did. Before signing on
the dotted line in 1976, the president made the University Board of
Trustees promise to look at his tenure after five years. They were
more than willing to comply with his request, and the result is this
year’s formation of the trustees’ Committee on Presidential Assess-
ment—a group of four trustees who have just finished soliciting
assessments of O’Brien from many sectors of the Bucknell com-
munity.

The thoroughness and

questioning of inform.
University—and how bo
years—is highly commendable; clearly, our
people concerned with far more than just this in:
welfare. At a time when we must proclaim with a panner headline
that the board has had to play ‘Bad Guy” and raise tuition and fees
by an unprecendented 15.2 percent, fort in knowing
these same people to be sensitive an
Thanks and praise too to O’Brien.
type are ‘‘the thing to do’ among Am
days. And rightly so; Bucknell is bound
result.

Thinking theater

We were sitting on the floor of Tustin Gym the other day, looking
up out of the darkness at a parade of figures as they appeared to give
their brief soliloquies in front of the mirror. The famous and the not
so famous passed by us: Zero Mostel to Arthur Garfield Hays.

As theater, it perhaps needed a little tightening, but as a state-
ment about politics in this country, ‘The American Way’ could not
have been more sharply focused. Here were our peers and pro-
fessors, those we see in the Bison and on Market Street, gathered to
tell us about the danger of a resurgence of investigations into what
have been oft-times euphemistically called “un-American” ac-
tivities.

What goes without saying by us is that the thought of more con-
gressional witchhunts like the one from 1938-1975 is appalling; what
needs to be said is a word of thanks to the conglomeration of people
who gave us that appalled feeling. So what if our buttock bones hurt
after sitting to watch the show. Our collective ego did a bit, too, and
that’s what counts.

Greeks need suggestions from Zeus and the gods

By Todd G. Buchholz

The Day of Reckoning is near. Tomor-
row will come the laughs and tears —
Bucknell’s version of ‘‘the thrill of victory
and the agony of defeat.”’ Saturday morn-
ing sorority hopefuls will get the salvific
word.

Last year 62 percent of the 338 girls who
registered received a welcome to Greek
life. The remainder either dropped out
voluntarily or were erased from the invita-
tion lists. Soon after Saturday, reform sug-
gestions will appear and complaints will
be registered by girls wondering whether
they said the wrong things at cocktail par-
ties or mismatched monogrammed
sweaters with skirts.

After reading Yale’s Insider’s Guide to
the Colleges unenthused appraisal of
Bucknell, I have concluded, with advice
from the Oracle at Delphi, that the present
Greek systems are hindering our surface
image problems and hampering our real
social difficulties. “Parties consist mostly
of mobbed fraternity affairs...”” the guide
states. Regrettably, this is true.

With more than 70 percent of the
freshmen pledging, Greek contributions to.
the campus should be greater. Yes, they
provide a means for learning group
cooperation and responsibility and a
medium for developing friendships. Yet
more is required. Again, with such a large
number committing their social lives and
hundreds of dollars each to the system, the

visible results should be more epic than
Hawaiian Night at Sigma Alpha Epsilon or
New Year’s at Delta Upsilon.

Personally, I subscribe to President
O’Brien’s interpretation of fraternal
history. Fraternities were the bridge be-
tween youth and adulthood 70 years ago.
Primarily for upperclassmen, frats were a

forum to learn the ways of mature citizens
————————

THE
BUCH
STOP

_——_—_—_—_——————
and a mode for debate — a place where

true Grecian, Aristotelian ideals were
perpetuated. Of course no one denies that
the Dionysian passions were unleashed oc-
casionally.

Today, according to the thesis, frater-
nities are not a link between up-
perclassmen and the real world but the
last fling of youth for underclassmen —
those final beer bottles tossed into the
shrubs.

But the image — the stuffed leather
chairs, the fireplaces and the friendly con-
versations — thrived.

Witness the atrophy of participation by

juniors and especially seniors in fraternity
functions. By the third year, the beer loses
its head and the routine becomes boring.
Mod parties become popular and the
houses are left to the sophomores.

It is time to improve the Greek life and
its contributions to the campus. Perhaps
changes will persuade veteran members
to stay on the team, allow freshmen to try
alternatives to crushing bashes, and alter
the scene we depict for prospective college
students.

Instead of 14 Saturday night band par-
ties, why not a few coffeehouses in addition
to the usual fare? People have lauded the
success of Christy’s Gate and lamented the
lack of a meeting place. How about one of
the beneficient frats offering its living
room to the much loved orphan? And as
long as drinking rules don’t seem ap-
plicable to the Greek temples, we might
even spice up the fruit drinks a bit.

Carey House offers slide shows and
discussions about foreign nations on Fri-
day afternoons. Is it inconceivable that
frat houses might try to stimulate more
conversation than beer pong jargon?
Remember that old turn-of-the-century
version; it’s pretty attractive.

I also suggest moving rush to second
semester. While there are logistical com-
plications and while financial arrange-
ments might have to be modified, a later
rush season would allow freshmen to
survey other social activities before whittl-
ing their paddles and shining their mugs.

Because of the work of hundreds of
volunteers, there’s more to Bucknell than
“mobbed fraternity affairs” — but not
enough. With the help of Greek leaders we
could get a better review in the next edi-
tion of the Insider’s Guide.

‘Helper’ goofs

To the Editor:

Friday’s issue of the Bucknellian in-
cluded an ad announcing the production
of a new play, ‘The American Way.”

Iam very certain that the person who
placed the ad had the best of intentions
in doing so. For that our production was
grateful. The ad was, however, very
much in error in two important ways.

First, the Bucknell Progressive
Caucus was not at all responsible for
the event. Several BPC members (of a
company of 24) were involved in the
production, but that was it.

Second, the production was a
refreshing collaborative effort.
Douglas Allchin ’79 and myself worked
together to compile and stage the work.
And the actors, actresses and crew
were happily an equal mix of students,
Lewisburg residents and faculty.
Together it was our theatre; the ad’s
proclamation that ‘‘Jeff Walker
Theatre Presents” was most certainly
an unfortunate mistake.

The Bucknellian is not faulted here at
all. It was completely a ‘“‘goof’’ by an
anonymous “‘helper.”’

In fact, the company of “The
American Way” is grateful that the
paper joined with area papers in
publishing other articles to help make
the event a success. We thank you.

I was weaned on the notion that voting
was a right that should be dutifully exer-
cised by every citizen. By casting a vote, I
was told, I would be making a contribution
to the electoral process.

The first time I can recall voting was in
my second grade class in early September
1967 when we were told by our teacher Mrs.
Kalikstein that our choice for president of
class 2-405 was an important position. The
job called for someone with a working
knowledge of the school, its teachers and
students as well as a firm understanding of
where the up and down staircases were.

I can recall the candidates quite vividly.
There was Davy Avis, former first grade
class president, Dicki Ziman, the kid from
California who loved to try out for school
plays and skinny little Greg Walker who,
weeks earlier, had transfered to our school
from someplace out in Illinois. No one in
class 2-405 was very excited with any of the
candidates for class president.

My classmates thought it made little dif-
ference whether our class president was
Davy, Greg or Dicki. I recall hearing the
girl next to me in math say once: “I want
someone who can lead us up the stairs
from line-up, but none of these kids seem
to know the best and fastest staircase.” It
seemed as though everyone felt uninspired
by the candidates.

Each candidate had several weak-
nesses. Davy Avis was being blamed for
the 15 percent increase in the price of milk
— the mainstay of snacks and lunches for
public school 69. No one really knew why
he was responsible for the increase, but he
was considered guilty because he was
class president at the time.

Davy was also having problems being
re-elected because many second graders
believed he lacked the ability to lead. It

Dicki, Davy and Greg: candidate

seemed that Davy did not get along well
with the school’s eraser monitors and stu-
dent crossing guards. Without the crossing
guards’ cooperation, Davy could not ade-
quately coordinate his class’ line while it
crossed the street during lunch-time and
fire drills.

The strongest criticism of Avis, though,
was that he had a so-called weak stand on
class 2-405’s cheating during free play.
When Avis proposed that both classes sit
down and agree to end cheating on the
field, he lost most of his support.

Dicki Ziman had capitalized on this issue
and proposed a ‘“‘get tough attitude” on
class 2-405. Dicki had argued that the more
concessions and compromises made, the
higher the chance of cheating by the other

side in the future. The kids in my class
seemed excited by this “get tough”
philosophy. Dicki Ziman attacked Davy
Avis on the milk issue. Dicki blamed the
increases in pints of milk on Davy’s inep-
titude (I don’t recall Dicki being that clear
on the issue). Dicki proposed to lower the
price of a pint of milk by cutting the
amount of money second graders had to
bank each week.

He had mentioned something about in-
creased money supplies, but no one
understood what he meant. They did,
however, like the idea of having to bank
less money.

Dicki’s most effective campaign weapon
for class president was his slogan: “Are
you kids better off now than you were last

Friday, February 20, 1981

s for president?

year?’’ Most second graders agreed since
most of them had failed to get increases in
their allowances, due to a thing their
parents called inflation.

By far the most curious kid running for
class president was Greg Walker. No one
had ever heard of Greg before, since he
was a new kid in town. During that one
week of campaigning, Greg would always
say that he was offering himself as a third
choice to the class of 2-405. He said little
else that the students could understand.

Three days before the election for class
president, Greg made a speech calling for
a sharp increase in the price of Pensi pinki
rubber balls. Second graders became in-
furiated at the notion that they would have
to cut down on the number of rubber balls
they bought per month. Many classmates
felt that proposing a tax on rubber balls
had little to do with leading class 2-405.

I still remember election day in our sec-
ond grade class. Everyone was confused.
It seemed that several rumors were cir-
culating that questioned the basic tenets of
the class election. Everyone was saying
that a vote for Greg was a vote for Davy
and that a vote for Davy was a vote against
Dicki. Many kids in class 2-405 were un-
sure why they should vote at all. Did their
vote for their candidate really count?

When it came time to cast their ballots
later that day, almost half of the class put
their heads on the desk and went to sleep
instead of going to the front of the room to
vote.

That was 13 years ago and it seems that
nothing much has changed.

BisonChips expanding to eight

By LYNNE RUTHERFORD

The Bison Chips have expanded from their
familiar four-man singing ensemble to a member-
ship of eight, including five new students.

Those selected after auditions held last weekend
are Mark Greenawald ’83, lead; Scott Benedict ’84,
baritone; Jeff Weitzel ’84, baritone; John Comerci
84, bass, and Bill De Turk ’83, bass.

They will join Scott Thistle 82, tenor; Howard
Hillman ’84, lead, and Christopher Brown ’81, bass.
Richard Pisano ’82 is abroad this semester but will
rejoin the Chips next year.

The new members were chosen from 15 ap-
plicants. Thistle said they were searching for ‘“‘not
necessarily the best quality voices, but ones that
blend well in the group.”

In increasing their membership, the Bison Chips
hope to expand their repertoire of old barbershop
quartet favorites into more contemporary and
challenging music, Thistle said.

“we're trying to get into different kinds of things,
and the more modern music requires a little bigger
sound,” he said.

“We'll keep some of the old barbershop songs, but
we want more variety,” added Brown.

The group began with eight members nine years
ago but was reduced to four in 1978 because of lack
of interest.

“Now we are asking for a higher level of commit-
ment to the group,” said Brown.

All members of the Bison Chips said this was to be
a building semester for them. They will not perform
as often as in the past, but instead will take time to
consolidate their new “‘big” sound.

‘Expanding ourselves is part of a long-range
goal. Eventually, we'd like to be up to par with
other, similar college groups,” Hillman said.

Dartmouth College and Yale University, among
other schools, have a long tradition of four and eight
man singing groups, and the Bison Chips hope to
establish a similar history here, they said.

Every Wednesday night,
Vaughan Literature Auditorium
is filled to its 430 seat capacity by
students to view films selected by
the Wednesday Night Film Series
Committee.

The selection process for the
films shown each semester
begins in March. By looking
through catalogues and listening
to suggestions, the committee
comes up with a list of approx-
imately 100 films, which is
filtered down to survey size, with
each member of the committee
selecting those he thinks will be
the most popular. This survey is
then distributed through campus
mail to all students.

The five films with the highest
number of votes — and within the
committee’s price range — are
the first chosen. The rest are
selected on the basis of what
types of films have been most
popular the previous year.

Prices of films vary from $300
to $500. This week’s film, ‘‘The
Goodbye Girl,’ was one of the
more expensive, costing slightly
more than $500. The admission
price of $1 is used to cover the
cost of films.

The committee usually ends up
breaking even on each film.

“Some films make a little
money, and some lose. We
generally make expenses plus a
little more,” Rob Cottington "82,
chairman of the committee, said.

The committee’s choices are
limited not only by price, but also
by a poor sound system and in-

adequate projectors.

WNFS tries to choose only
American made films, leaving
foreign films to the Hilltop Series.
They have found ‘‘oldies” like
“African Queen” and “Singing in
the Rain,”’ as well as Woody Allen
films, to be among the most
popular.

The purpose of the Wednesday
night film series remains to pro-
vide an entertaining alternative
to students beyond books or
fraternity parties.

“We want people to leave smil-
ing and feeling good,” Betsy
Duane ’82, another WNFS
member, said.

The committee is now
in the process of selecting new
members. Those now on the com-
mittee — which include Cot-
tington and Duane — must relin-
quish their positions at the end of
their junior year. Three new ap-
plicants will be chosen before
that time to increase the
membership to five, where it was
a year ago before members
graduated or lost interest.

Cottington and Duane are now
reviewing the qualifications of
prospective members from the
freshman and sophomore
classes. Students are selected
primarily on the basis of their ex-
perience with film.

“we look for people who both
show an interest in film and film-
making and for those who are
willing to show a commitment.
Lack of experience does not
necessarily exclude someone
from a position,’’ Duane said.

Colorful yearbook and

lampoon are considered

Record sales anticipated

By ANN LEIGHTHEISER

This year’s yearbook promises to be more colorful, readable, and
longer than in the past, according to L’Agenda Editor Jim Zimmer-
man ’81.

“L) Agenda will be a really professional publication,” Zimmerman
said. Innovations planned by the editor and his staff include increasing
the length of the publication from last year’s 380 to a record-high 520
and adding 32 additional color pages of sports, arts and candids.

Twelve hundred copies of this year’s book have been sold already,
which was the total number distributed last year. Zimmerman credits
this increased number to an effective sales campaign and the im-
proved quality of last year’s book from the year before’s.

If sales go as well as Zimmerman anticipates, 2000 copies of L’Agen-
da could easily be sold this year. The spring sales campaign will run
March 9-20.

The resulting extra money will allow for further innovation in the
way of a 40 page introduction being compiled by Zimmerman on cam-
pus history, as well as 24 pages dedicated to sororities and fraternities.
There will also be 80 pages reserved for candids, which Zimmerman
hopes will include a sizable percentage of the student body due to a
staff of 35 photographers.

In addition to the innovations in L’Agenda made allowable by in-
creased sales, Zimmerman is attempting to establish a lampoon-type
magazine which would be published monthly and provide satire
through articles and cartoons on national and campus events.

“There’s a need for this type of publication here. It would be healthy
to laugh at ourselves,” Zimmerman said.

He added that waiting for ABS appropriations for the magazine
would greatly delay, if not kill, the venture, so it would have to start
out as a sister publication to the yearbook for the first few issues, or
until it could become self-sufficient through advertising.

Zimmerman added that he hoped this year’s success with yearbook
sales and increased innovations would result in greater recognition
from the university’s administration. Last year, University President
Dennis O’Brien questioned the need for a college yearbook at all.

Playful Mozart was
stylishly performed

By WILLIAM G. HOLZBERGER

“Cosi fan Tutte,” a comic opera with a libretto by Da Ponte, is
the lightest and least significant of Mozart’s works. First perform-
ed in 1790, a fine production of this opera was given last Saturday at
Susquehanna University by the Pittsburgh Chamber Opera
Theatre.

“Cosi fan Tutte’’ is overshadowed, musically and philosophical-
ly, by the Master’s greatest works: “The Marriage of Figaro”
(1786), “Don Giovanni” (1787), and “The Magic Flute” (1791).
Nevertheless, ‘“‘Cosi”’ is a well-made comedy, in the classic opera
buffa tradition, with the stock ingredients of love-sick young ladies
and young men, disguised identities and confusion, a practical and
unsentimental little baggage of a sly maid-servant, and a disillu-

sioned elderly bachelor, who causes all of the mischief and then :

makes it all come out happily in the end.

Musically, ‘‘Cosi’’ is sophisticated and exquisite. Beginning with
the lively overture, the opera proceeds apace with a veritable bou-
quet of arias and ensemble pieces. There are solo arias for every
voice, and combinations galore, including duets, trios, quartets,
and two fine sextets which conclude both halves of the opera.

The opera, therefore, contains many musical highlights and two
great arias: the tenor’s first act rhapsody, ‘My Love is a Flower,”
and Fiordiligi’s great second-act set piece, in which she laments
her vacillating heart and swears constancy to her Guglielmo. In
Saturday evening’s production, both these great arias were sung
creditably and one of them magnificently.

David Drehec, as Ferrando, showed us a potentially formidable
lyric tenor voice — with a solid core and fine ringing quality. Dur-
ing this performance, however, his voice was not under complete
control. He stayed off pitch several times, and unfortunately this
occurred while singing his great aria. There was also some
awkwardness in phrasing.

Carol Sparrow, as Fiordiligi, was uniformly splendid throughout
the entire performance, continuously producing a large, rich,
perfectly modulated tone.

She did absolute justice to her great second act aria, a tremen-
dously difficult piece, with great range and huge intervals. The
soprano is required repeatedly to leap from one end of the scale to
the other — from valley to mountaintop.

Legend has it that Mozart disliked the soprano commissioned to
create the role of Fiordiligi and consequently made things as dif-
ficult for her as possible.

Debra Borkovich and Thomas Bankston, as Dorabella and
Guglielmo, showed themselves to be excellent actors and very
competent singers. Mozart gave neither of the great solo moments
of Fiordiligi and Ferrando, but they were very effective in the
ensemble pieces and created distinct stage personalities.

Michael Wieser, as the elderly Don Alfonso, was superb. A strap-
ping young man, Wieser conveyed, with total conviction, the im-
pression of a doddering and disillusioned old aristocrat. Don Alfon-
so sounded as fine as he looked. His diction was wonderfully clear,
and his singing mellow and beautiful, a fine rich bass, with lyrical
softness in the upper register and dark, velvety low tones.

Davida Kagen, as the enterprising maidservant Despina, was
very effective vocally and — in her multiple roles as the bloated
German doctor with a Henry Kissinger accent and the phony judge
— she displayed considerable power as a comedienne.

Saturday night’s performance of ‘Cosi’ was a visual as well as
an auditory delight. The simple set was unfussy and perfectly ade-
quate, and the costumes were rich, graceful and colorful.

Hearty congratulations to Mildred Miller Posvar and her fine
company of gifted artists for this most memorable night at the
opera.

Eastwood triumphs in encore

By JACKIE SPAULDING

“Any Which Way You Can,” starring Clint
Eastwood and Sondra Locke, is being held over at
the Campus Theater for another week, with
showtimes at 7 and 9:05 p.m.

It is no surprise that this extremely funny and
entertaining movie is still playing. One does not
have to be an ardent Clint Eastwood fan to enjoy
this film; the continuous humor will carry the show.
Unlike Eastwood’s earlier films, “Any Which Way
You Can” lacks violence and gore.

However, Eastwood is still the tough guy, play-
ing an auto mechanic who engages in illegal boxing
involving large sums of money. It is around this ac-
tivity that the storyline revolves.

We are also introduced to the ‘National Syn-
dicate,’ who make their profits by backing fighters.
Eastwood is hired by the mob—with a payoff of
$25,000—to fight a renowned boxer.

Complicating this simple plot is Eastwood’s new-
ly reclaimed love, Lynne, played by Sondra Locke.
The beautiful Locke, had stolen Eastwood’s heart in

their previous film together, “Every Which Way
But Loose.” Fortunately, this age-old story of
boy finally winning girl is reestablished in this film,
adding a sense of romance to all the boxing.

Interfering with Eastwood’s lifestyle, Lynne
persuades him not to fight this last round, for his op-
ponent is a known killer in the ring. However, the
mob’s mode of persuasion, namely the kidnapping
of Lynne, encourages Eastwood to continue with the
fight.

Jack Wilson, played by William Smith,
benevolently aids Eastwood in the rescue of the
‘damsel’, and the rest of the film portrays their
madcap effort to recover Lynne. A breathtaking
brawl between the two climaxes “Any Which Way
You Can.”

The enjoyment of this film is enhanced by the
orangutan, Clyde, who is Eastwood’s closest com-
panion excepting Lynne. Clyde’s crazy antics and
schemes will keep one laughing for hours. Fine sup-
porting performances by Geoffry Lewis and Ruth
Gordon also add humor to the movie.

Leslie sinks Wes

Bison team captain surpasses career scoring total with 1,845 points

By DAVE KIRKPATRICK

Everyone in sweltering Davis Gym had
been waiting all night for it to happen.
Bison players had been feeding captain Al
Leslie ’81 all game waiting for it to occur.

Finally, near the five-minute mark of
the Breakin’ Bisons’ 87-79 victory over
West Chester Wednesday, it happened.
Leslie was loose on a break-away, soared
above a Golden Ram defender, and
slammed the ball through the rim to begin
his most productive outing of the season.

Leslie, who became Bucknell’s all-time
career scoring leader Saturday with 1,854
points, went on to score 41 points and
added seven rebounds and six assists in a
supreme individual effort.

- Two long jumpers apiece for Leslie and
back court mate Dave Shehadi ’81 had
pushed Bucknell to an early 124 lead, but
as would occur time and again in the
game, the visitors refused to fold and soon
were back in the game.

Strong play by Leslie and Ray Moss ’83,
coupled with a long jumper by Howard
Manly ’81 at the buzzer gave the hoopsters
a 41-31 halftime lead.

Bucknell opened the second half with a
more tenacious man-to-man full court
defense and started to widen its margin.
Shehadi controlled the offense with 10
assists and Paul Adkins ’81 and Craigg
Cody ’83 came off the bench to provide
added firepower, allowing the Bisons to
maintain their double-digit advantage.

West Chester rallied to within six with
2:15 left, but Bucknell held on for its fifth

Bisons trail Rider by one game.

Against Delaware Saturday, Bucknell
saw its win streak snapped at three with a
76-67 loss on the Blue Hens home court.

Delaware was led by 6-4 leaper Ken
Luck, who had 33 points against Bucknell
last year, with 31 points. Leslie again led
the Bisons, scoring 28 points, including a
perfect 10 for 10 from the foul line.

Monday night’s trip to Philadelphia
proved frustrating as Temple downed the
cagers, 77-59. As has been the pattern for
Bucknell, they got off slowly, finding
themselves trailing 1446, before high
scorer Leslie could get untracked.

The Owls’ front line of 6-46 Neal Robin-
son, 6-7 Alton McCollough, and 6-11 Ron
Wister overwhelmed the Bisons’ shorter
front line, resultir7 in many second and
third opportunities ..< the offensive end for
Temple.

Nevertheless, behind the shooting of
Moss and Leslie, the hoopsters trailed by
only 2, 27-25, at the half.

The second half, however, belonged en-
tirely to Temple. With Robinson exploding
on offense and McCollough hounding
Leslie on defense, Temple shot 71 percent
as a team and completed the rout in an im-
pressive fashion.

Leslie led the Bucknell scorers with 22
points while Page hit for 11 and Okorodudu
and Moss eight each.

The women’s track team im-

important one for the women, as
two more Bisons qualified for the

WRESTLING WINS TWO—Steve Greenly ‘82 (right) takes

over the Blue Hens at home Saturday. Greenly blasted
Philippi 16-1 in the 177-pound weight class to up his record
to 17-5 overall. Bucknell also drubbed American 36-6 in
the tri-match, winning eight of the 10 matches, to improve
its record to 7-8. Wins over Lafayette and Rider Saturday at
Easton would give the grapplers two straight winning
seasons for the first time in 19 years. Senior captain Doug
Mays at 126 and freshman Bill White at 158 were double
winners Saturday. In his final home match as a Bison, Mays
improved his overall mark to 19-4 with a forfeit and a 15-3
decision while White recorded 13-1 and 11-1 decisions.

Hecker had already qualified for
the one mile relay tearn with
teammates Linda Accettura "82,
Nancy Russo ’84 and Laurie Van-
Wyck ’83.

With Russo leading the way,
the Bisons won eight of 11 in-
dividual events against a tough
Army team, whose only loss in
eight previous meets had been to
the University of Pennsylvania.
Russo set a school record in the
20-yard dash (27.46 secs.) and
tied the record in the 60-yard
dash (7.5), as well as posting a
win in the long jump with a
distance of 4.95 meters.

Lonnie Fertik ’83 had wins in
the high jump (5'4”) and the 60-
meter hurdles (9.6), as well as a
second place finish in the shot put
(10.34m.) behind winner Beth Bit-
tel ’83 who had an 11.75m. heave.

Accettura took the 800-meter
run in 2:23.4, while the two-mile
run went to freshman Stacy
Nicholson with a time of 11:43.9.

The only individual races the

women dropped were the three-
mile run, the 440-yard dash, and
the one-mile run. Army swept all
three relays: the 880-yd. relay,
the one-mile relay, and the two-
mile relay.

Before the Eastern Champion-
ships the Bisons will host the
Bucknell Invitational Saturday
and then compete against Lock
Haven and Mount St. Mary’s here
on Feb. 28.

Women swimmers splash on

The women’s swimming team
closed its home schedule this
week with impressive wins over
Gettysburg, 83-53, and Army, 97-
41, to push their record to 11-2.

Highlighting the women’s rout
over Army Saturday were
sophomore Karen Young’s wins
in both the 50- and 100-yard
backstrokes and junior Martha
Parker’s victories in the one- and
three-meter diving competitions.

Freshman Lisa Desrochers
tied for first in the 100-yard
freestyle with Amy Stifel ’84 who
also won the 100-yard individual
medley. Tri-Captain Kathy
Frazier °82 qualified for yet
another event in the AIWA Divi-
sion IV finals March 14-15 by

i

posting a 2:13.97 win in the 200-
yard butterfly.

Bucknell took both medley and
freestyle relays while All-
American Bitzer Dexter ’82 and
Nancy McGrath ’83, having
already qualified for the National
Championships, won the 50 and
100-yard breaststrokes, respec-
tively.

Returning to Freas-Rooke Pool

defeated Gettysburg even though
they lost the opening medley

junior Doug Pickell (4:14.6) even though
all three teammates also posted their best
indoor times.

The greatest drop in time, however,
came from sophomore Dave White in the
second heat of the mile. Plagued by a nag-
ging hip injury in the fall, White kicked to a
sparkling 4:24 clocking and bettered his
previous best time by more than 10
seconds.

Bucknell’s fine freshman class

Men’s swimming 1

defeated by Lasalle

By ARTHUR BROCKWAY
The men’s swimming team traveled to Philadelphia Saturday on-
ly to lose a close 61-52 decision to LaSalle, the defending conference
champions, to drop to 6-3.
Having lost to LaSalle by 20 points last season, Saturday’s result
showed great improvement. Head Coach Dick Russell commented,
“J am very pleased, the guys have worked harder than any team
I’ve ever had. Their effort is paying off now by enabling us to fight
it out for the championship.”
Mark Corl ’81 was instrumental to the Bisons’ attack by captur-
ing three first place finishes. In addition to remaining unbeaten in
the 50-yard freestyle with a time of 21.93, Corl anchored the vic-
torious 400-yard medley and 400-yard Freestyle Relays. His 45.5 se-
cond split in the medley relay not only made up for a half-length
deficit, but was the fastest split in University history.
Other members of the medley relay team, clocked at 3:35:20,
were Doug Haverland ’84, Mark Gensheimer ’81, and Dave Wakely

Hoopsters win 2 of 3

By JEANNE MINAHAN

The women’s basketball team is beginning to acquire a taste for
victory, with two sparkling wins in its last three games.

The cagers fought to a 49-29 halftime lead over the visiting
Bloomsburg Huskies Tuesday and then cruised to a 79-61 win, up-
ping their record to 5-12 with two games remaining. The roller-
coaster season is “definitely ending on a high note,” according to
coach Terrie Grieb. The Bloomsburg game proved this with an as-
tounding 80 percent accuracy from the foul line on 25 out of 31 free
throw shots. Co-captain Jill Henry ’81 highlighted the effort with 28
points and 17 rebounds and co-captain Liz Rabenold ’81 added 11
points to the win.

The victory over the Huskies was a needed boost after the women
lost 80-65 to a tall and aggressive University of Pittsburgh at
Johnstown squad Saturday at home. Johnstown is third-ranked in
the NCAA Division III.

In addition to controlling the boards, Johnstown’s Sue Shimkus
sank 14 buckets, while teammate Carol Mum tallied 23 points.

Henry and sophomore Denise Cohen contributed 20 points each
for the Bisons and Jenny Burke ’83 added seven. Henry broke the
University record for points scored in a season last week with 234,
eclipsing Rabenold’s 1980 mark of 199. Cohen, with 189 points this
season, also has a shot at passing the old figure.

In addition, Henry broke the single season University field goal
record with 94 baskets while Cohen has 86, one under the old record
of 87 set by Karen Wegener ’79.

Rabenold needs 16 points to bring her career point total past the
record of 595 set by Bobbie Castens ’79.

By MIKE DeBRAGGIO

With only a week remaining before the
important East Coast Conference cham-
pionship meet, the Bucknell trackmen
have nearly completed their preparation
to defend the conference title.

In an open meet Saturday in the
Sports/Recreation Complex, the efforts of
the Orange and Blue were marked by a
number of individual best performances
both in the field and on the track.

In the field events, sophomore pole
vaulter Jamie Dodd was clearly the
outstanding performer. After struggling
much of the season to clear 14 feet, he
vaulted a personal best 14 feet 7.5 inches to
place second and establish a new Bucknell
record. The old mark of 14 feet 6 inches
was set in 1977 by current Bison field coach
Mike Baker.

Ted Lewis, a sophomore who has
already cleared 6 feet 10 inches in the high
jump, regained some of his early season
form with a 6 feet 8.6 inches winning effort
in his specialty. He was pressed by up-and-
coming freshman Bill Miller who topped
the 6 feet 6 inches mark for the second
meet in a row — this time by a %-inch.
Lewis also managed a second in the triple

jump with a distance of 45 feet % inches.

The 35-lb. weight throw went to junior
Jim Passannante (37’-4’’) with classmate
Dave Beltramello recording his personal
best for second. In the other weight event,
junior shot putters Gary Bartlett and Mike
Ward continued their struggle back to
form. Bartlett tossed the sphere 46 feet 11.5
inches for second while Ward’s 46 feet 6.5
inch effort placed him third.

Bison competitors also performed well
on the track. Junior Martin Carter con-
tinued his season-long dominance of the 60-
yd. sprint with a mediocre 6.4 clocking,
while classmate Rocky Thompson was out-
leaned for first in the hurdles.

Three of the four middle distance events
went to Bison freshmen. Tony Balestrieri
copped the quarter mile in 52.0, Mike
Geraghty ran a superb 1:12.9 in the 600 and
Jeff Hines’ 2:17.4 proved to be good enough
to win the 1,000.

The Bucknell orange and blue was also
very visible in the distance events. A
standout all season, junior Steve Bigotto
led a Bucknell sweep in the mile run.
Bigotto hit the half at 2:02.5 and held on for
a personal best 4:11.9. His time bested the

Center Dan Fitzpatrick ‘83 (11) wins a faceoff in the Ice Hockey team’s triumph over Sunbury
Monday. The Nukes avenged a trio of earlier losses to the Suns to up their record to 10-3-1.

Ice hockey team skates circles

around unbeaten Sunbury, 8-5

By JEFF CROSS

It was the classic David versus
Goliath struggle.

The Bucknell Ice Hockey
Club—a coachless, sophomore
dominated team with enough raw
talent to run up a 9-3-1 record—
faced the unbeaten Sunbury
Suns, the perennial champions of
the Susquehanna Valley Hockey
League and conquerors of
Bucknell in three previous en-
counters, Monday in Sunbury.

Unlike its earlier 5-4 and 846
losses to the Suns, when the
Nukes waited until the final
period to ripple the Sunbury net,
Bucknell started fast. Indeed,
from the opening faceoff, the out-
come was never in doubt as the
Nukes harassed the Sunbury
defensemen and _ backchecked
diligently throughout to emerge
with an 8-5 victory.

The win, coupled with an 86

triumph ‘over Susquehanna
Saturday, upped the Nukes’
record to 10-3-1.

Against Sunbury, Stalio Boyd
80 broke the ice only 4:51 into the
game with a backhand shot on
assists from Fid Speer ’80 and
Jeff Cross ’82. At the 12:37 mark,
Bill Lightfoot ’82 banged home
freshman Stu Vaeth’s centering
pass and three minutes later,
Remi Johnson ’83 scored on a
slapshot from the left side with an
assist to Hugh Thornhill ’81.

The period ended with Bucknell
holding a 15-7 shots on goal ad-
vantage to go with their 3-0 lead.

However, the Suns were too
talented to be counted out, and a
shorthanded Sunbury score
followed by a pair of Suns goals
nine seconds apart left the con-
test tied midway through the se-
cond stanza.

Bucknell’s intensity never

diminished, though, and—
inspired by a boisterous crowd—
the skaters retook the territorial
advantage.

Dan Fitzpatrick °83, who
forechecked fiercely all night,
gave Bucknell the lead at 9:16 on
assists to Jolinson and Jeff
Kaighn ’83. Three minutes later,
Ron Reynier ’82 scored on a
scramble in front of Sunbury’s
cage and then Paul Devlin "83
blasted in a slapshot from the
blue line on a pass from Kaighn
for a 6-3 Nuke advantage.

The Nukes, a man down for five
minutes, surrendered a Sunbury
power play goal at 17:21, but
regained their three goal lead 40
seconds later when Johnson
scored his second, assisted by
Kaighn, to close the period.

ing, hard hitting and steady

Four bomb threats made since
the beginning of the academic
year have heightened the concern
of University administrators and
have played a part in a recent
revision of official policy for deal-
ing with the problem.

The most recent bomb threat
occurred Friday, when a “young,
mate voice” called the University
switchboard at 10:50 am, ac-
cording to Vice President for Ad-
ministration and Finance John
Zeller. He said the caller simply
told the operator that “there is a
bomb in Hunt Hall” and hung up.

Zeller, campus security and
Lewisburg Police responded to
the call, and the decision to
evacuate the building was made
at 11 a.m. Zeller said, however,
that he made a “judgement call,”
when he allowed several
residents to return to their rooms
to get dressed and to get their
books.

“At that time I decided that the

all was probably a prank,”

Zeller said. ‘Although the girls
were told to enter at their own
risk and to return in five minutes,
some people criticized the ac-
tion,”’ he said.

Two other bomb threats were
received on the night of Dec. 13-
14, causing the evacuation of
Roberts Hall in both instances.
The first call, made by a “calm,
sober male voice,” was received
in the Roberts Residence Direc-
tor’s Suite at 9:15 p.m., Zeller
said.

According to Zeller, the caller
said, “One and one make two, but
two and two don’t always make
four. Four is where the bomb
goes off at 9:30.” The building
was evacuated by campus securi-
ty shortly thereafter.

Zeller said two parties were
scheduled to begin at 9:30, on the
first and third floor. Residents
were allowed to reenter at their
own risk two hours later.

Students speculated that the
threat was a clue that a bomb
might be planted on 3% Roberts.

The ABS has paid a $10,000
kickback to Dean of Student Af-
fairs John Dunlop to “cover the
cost of his Mazzarati (sic)? and
its treasury is missing an addi-
tional $18,000 because of “‘govern-
ment waste,” according to the
minutes of the Feb. 9 and 18 ABS
meetings.

Although the minutes report
this corruption and waste, the
allegations are fictitious, ac-
cording to ABS Secretary Lon
Castle ’83.

Castle said he included the
barbs about government waste
and Dunlop’s kickback to spice
up the minutes and to make the
members of the ABS want to read
the minutes each week.

The minutes for the past two
weeks have been strewn with
similar jokes designed, ac-
cording to Castle, “just to catch
their eyes,” and to “keep the at-

tention’”’ of Congressmen.

He said the minutes are factual
in every other respect, and that
he ‘“wouldn’t think” that his
humorous interjections — one of
which described the condition of
ABS President Michael Suarez
g2 as “deranged” — would hurt
the credibility of the congress.

Suarez said he thought the
minutes were “crazy” and “a lit-
tle bit juvenile,” but said ‘at
least the congress is reading
them.” He said the minutes
“make good reading” and
although they could hurt the
credibility of the congress, itisa
“risk worth taking.”

Another joke in the minutes sug-
gested that Suarez had purchased
a Corvette with ABS funds.
Suarez denied this, and explained
that the congress is just “putting
out some crazy stuff.”

Dunlop also denied receiving
any funds. ‘I’ve never received a

kickback or anything from
anyone.” He said Castle is ‘doing
a lot of hacking around” with the
reports of the meetings, but he
did not ‘‘want to criticize him or
praise him”’ for it.

The minutes, labeled with the
epithet ‘‘All the news we choose
to print,” are intended only for
the congress, Suarez said, and on-
ly 50 copies are printed each
week.

He said the ABS plans to con-
tinue producing “funny” minutes
each week, and to also issue a
supplementary “straight and
serious” edition of minutes each

month. i
Roberts Dorm Representative
Tricia Kennedy 84 said,
however, that she has been
posting each meeting’s minutes
in the foyer of the dormitory for
everyone to read. She said he
hoped more students would read
them now that they are “funny.”

local state store employees

By TRICIA KENNEDY

Pennsylvania Gov. Dick Thornburgh’s
proposal to abolish the state’s retail liquor
store system and convert it to a private
enterprise has caused concern among
local employees of the government - owned
state stores.

An employee of the Liquor Control
Board at Danville, who asked not to be
identified, disagrees with several items in
Thornburgh’s proposal, which includes
removing all restrictions on the advertis-
ing and marketing of liquor.

The employee said that since privately
owned stores will still be required to draw
their supplies from the same government
warehouses as did the state stores,
customers will not have a better selection
of liquor. In addition, the loss of revenue to
the state will probably result in taxes on
other consumer goods such as clothing and
food, the employee said.

Richard Neff, a clerk in the Lewisburg
State Store at 326 Market Street, said that
should the governor’s proposal go into ef-
fect, present government-owned liquor
store managers ‘“‘won’t have a chance.”

Thornburgh’s plan ‘‘will take my job
away,” Neff said. “I only earn $15 thou-
sand a year. If I wanted to set up my own

money to pay for inventory equal to what
the state carries now?”

Vice president for Administration and
Finance John Zeller said the approval of
the legislation will not affect the Universi-
ty in any way.

In a Jan. 28 press release, the governor
said under his proposed plan, the state
would gradually divest itself entirely of the
present 725-outlet retail system. This ac-
tion would open the retail market to as
many privately »wned stores as market
conditions, local options and licensing and
zoning requirements will permit.

Thornburgh said his proposal is the
result of a long history of corruption and
mismanagement in the existing system as
operated by the Liquor Control Board,
which was established in 1933.

According to Thornburgh, privately
owned liquor stores will provide better
customer service by offering ‘greater
variety, better prices, and more conve-
nient hours and locations.”

“Monopolies — especially government -
operated monopolies — are not inclined to
be responsive” to the “legitimate com-
plaints of the customer,” Thornburgh said.

The state would “continue to operate an
expanded wholesale liquor distribution

Former CBS News President Richard Salant said Thursday
night that his current position as Vice Chairman of the Board of NBC
is “not nearly as interesting”’ as his previous position with CBS.

Salant spoke with former President and Vice Chairman of the
Board of CBS Frank Stanton before a crowd of nearly 200 persons in
the University Center Forum.

He explained after the lecture that he has “‘no influence with
news at NBC’’ because he is “‘top brass now.’’ He said he would
“Jove’’ to get more involved with the news operations, however.

Salant was President of CBS News for 16 years before he took his
current senior management position with NBC in May 1979.

After an introduction by Dean of Arts and Sciences Robert

Chambers, Salant spoke to the near-capacity crowd for 12 minutes,

followed by a 20-minute discourse by Stanton explaining his early

FRANK STANTON GAECER years.

Stanton said he ‘“‘tried to get as much of a liberal education” as

Record number rush this year;
253 women pledge sororities

By LISA CERUTI

Sorority rush ended Saturday morning when 253
pledges were ribboned at Hunt Hall.

The 344 women who registered for the three-week
rush period is the largest number of students ever to
participate in sorority rush.

A total of 73 percent of the women who registered
for rush were pledged. The number of students who
accepted bids included 217 freshmen and 36 up-
perclassmen.

The number of pledges represents 67 percent of
freshman women and 72 percent of those who were
eligible to rush.

This year, six sororities took the pre-determined
quota of 33 pledges, three took less than quota and
one — Zeta Phi Beta — dropped out of formal rush
before pledging occurred.

According to Assistant in Residential Life and
Panhell advisor Maureen Chemsak, the revised
quota system used this year helped to distribute the
pledges more evenly than last year.

Last year, quota was determined by taking the
number of girls who accepted invitations to Coke
Dates, the third party of formal rush, and dividing
by ten, the number of sororities participating in
rush.

The quota system was modified this year to pro-
vide a “more realistic’? quota. The figure was
changed to the number of women rushing after In-
vitational Open Suites — the fourth party — divided
by ten.

Chemsak said deriving the quota from attendance
at a later party reduced the number. ‘‘The purpose

A list of the University’s sororities and the
women who pledged them this weekend. — page 5

of the quota system is to ideally provide a place for
100 percent of the girls who register for rush. Since
the distribution of pledges is not equal, all women do
not receive bids but there are places for all who
registered,” she said.

Other reforms in the rush system included the
limit Panhell imposed on each sorority concerning
the number of girls who could be invited to Theme
Parties and Preferentials.

In previous years, Panhell recommended that
sororities invite roughly two and one-half times
quota to Themes and three and one-half times quota
to Preferentials. This month, the “‘recommenda-
tions’”” were enforced by Panhell so that most
sororities had to make cuts at these times.

“Last year some groups suffered because they
didn’t cut at the right time. The recommended cuts
forced people to make decisions earlier and then
allowed them to make other choices,’”’ Chemsak
said.

Sororities which did not take quota may conduct
“open bidding,’ which lasts through September.
Groups may accept pledges until they reach quota
or membership of 65, whichever comes first.

Panhellenic Rush Council Chairman Kim Cooke
*81 said, “rush ran very smoothly this year. There
were only a small percentage of girls who didn’t
receive bids after prefs and more sororities took
quota than did last year.”

“the privatization process,” the governor
said.

he could, and that he believed his example characterized that “‘if
you’re motivated and take advantage of the opportunities around
you” you can be successful.

Salant’s and Stanton’s presentations were followed by a 40-
minute question and answer period during which Stanton explained
that — because television is a mass medium — it must try ‘‘to please
as many people’’ as it can “‘in the time it has.’’ He said viewers
should therefore ‘‘be selective in what. you watch”’ on television,
“ust as you wouldn’t go to the bookstore and read every book.”

Salant responded to a question of conflicts of interest within
news programming to say that this is an ‘‘enduring myth.”’ He said
direct conflicts between advertisers and news staffers ‘simply
never occur.”’

Salant and Stanton spoke as part of this year’s Class of ’53 Lec-
tureship. The program is called ‘‘Messages from the Medium”’ and
included an “‘open classroom”’ in the forum from 10 a.m. to noon to-
day.

Consultant to InterVarsity Christian Fellowship Becky Pippert
addresses a group in the Univesity Center Forum on the prob-
lem of communicating spiritually in the 1980s Wednesday

night.

By JAN BALAKIAN

The problem of communicating spiritually in the
1980s was addressed by Evangelism consultant to
InterVarsity Christian Fellowship Becky Pippert in
the University Center Forum Wednesday evening.

Author of Pizza Parlor Evangelism and Out of the
Salt Shaker: Evangelism as a Way of Life, and an
article entitled ‘Discovery of Spirituality in Higher
Education,”’ Pippert said ‘“‘to understand what it is
to be human, we must discover the spiritual part of
ourselves. This dimension sets us free, and makes
us whole.’’ She argued that although during the 70s,
Americans sought a spiritually deeper life through
developing relationships, many went in the wrong
direction by joining cults.

Pippert attributed the fact that many Americans
are misled to the poor way in which spirituality is
communicated. She explained the need to express
spirituality in a sensitive, clear and nonaggressive
manner.

“We are confused about how to integrate
spirituality into our humanity,’ Pippert said.
Reflecting the lives in the Gospels, one must love

when he is not loved in return and praise those who
persecute him. ‘‘Living as Christ lived in the scrip-
tures demands sacrifices, yet it allows for honesty
and leads to health in the long run,” she said.
Pippert concluded that Jesus is what makes us
human and is the source of our survival. In order to
actualize one’s true belief in Christ, an individual
must identify with the world while being radically
different from it and sacrificing for others, she said.

Pippert also conducted evangelism seminars on
the subject of Christian witnessing in the University
Center Corner Room Thursday morning. This topic
dealt with the problem for Christians in describing
their faith to others. Thursday evening she spoke at
the weekly meeting of the Bucknell Christian
Fellowship, which sponsored her visit.

Pippert received both her Bachelor’s and Master’s
degrees from the University of Illinois in English
Literature. Her husband, Wess Pippert, is cor-
respondent to the White House for United Press In-
ternational and has written a book entitled The
Spiritual Journey of Jimmy Carter.

ABS institutes task force system to inform congress

By SUSAN MACDONALD

In an effort to actively investigate various concerns
within the University community, the Association of
Bucknell Students instituted a task force system at its
meeting on Monday.

The collection of 20 two-person teams will provide the
ABS with current, accurate information for dealing with
the administration, faculty and students, ABS President
Michael Suarez ’82 said.

The first task force reported on the ABS-sponsored
scholarship, currently paid for through the student ac-
tivities fee. The report, presented by Dan Huck ’84 and
David Tyler ’83, was based on an interview with Director
of Financial Aid Ronald Laszewski. According to
Laszewski, Bucknell’s financial aid program is weak in

comparison to its frame of reference schools.

While approximately 26 percent of Bucknell students
receive some aid, the first $1500 must be provided by the
student, Huck said. This requirement is waived for
athletes, who currently receive 30 percent of the financial
aid budget, he said.

“An additional $150,000 would be available if athletes
were responsible for this amount, and 50 to 70 more
students could be helped,’’ Huck said. Tyler said this
would limit the athletes by “requiring them to work in ad-
dition to the time they spend on sports.”

The discussion of the ABS scholarship will be continued
next week, when Director of Admissions Richard Skelton
and Laszewski will answer questions from the congress.

terest in the completion of the third floor of the University
Center was also presented. Team topics include the stu-
dent handbook, reading period and dead week, cur-
riculum reform, January programs, the arts at Bucknell
and career interviews.

Teaching awards as an incentive to the faculty, student-
run course evaluations, a rape symposium and a week
devoted to an understanding of disabled persons are also
being explored.

Studies on the counseling and the career services, the
dispensary, coed freshman dorms, the use of special in-
terest housing, Christy’s Gate and second semester rush
will also be conducted.

ABS Secretary Lon Castle ’83 said the teams were not
limited to congress members.

The fifth century was perhaps the most spectacular period in history — the
time of the Buddha, Herodotus, Anaxagoras, Socrates, Pericles, and of the first ex-
plorations into the human soul and the mysteries of the universe. Through Vidal's
hero-narrator, Cyrus Spitama, grandson of the prophet Zoroaster, we witness at

first hand the wonders of the epoch.

Cyrus’ narrative brings the reader face to face with some of the greatest men
who ever lived, in vivid and unforgettable detail. It brings alive the ancient world
in which so many of our modern world’s ideas — spiritual, philosophical, political,
and scientific — were conceived. An adventure on many different levels, this is by
far the most ambitious and stimulating novel Gore Vidal has yet written.

This visually stunning book, with over 250 full-color illustrations, is based
on Carl Sagan’s thirteen part television series. Cosmos is about science in its
broadest human context, how science and civilization grew up together. The
book also explores spacecraft missions of discovery to the nearby planets, the
human brain, Egyptian hieroglyphics, the origin of life, the death of the Sun,
the evolution of galaxies and the origins of matter, suns, and worlds.

Cosmos is the story of our long journey of discovery, as Sagan looks at our
planet from an extraterrestrial vantage point and sees a jewel-like world, in-
habited by a life form that is just beginning to.discover its own unity and to

venture into the vast ocean of space

Misrepresentation policy
reaffirmed by University

From MISREPRESENTATION, page 1.

Marvin charged that it was Bucknell’s responsibility that she was
unable to obtain certification and a job, Zeller said. The suit concluded
with Bucknell settling out of court without prejudice ‘‘to avoid the
legal fees necessary to fight the case,”’ Zeller said.

“Bucknell is not alone in this phenomenon,” Zeller said, “‘many
other institutions have been sued by dissatisfied students.’’ The situa-
tion in the courts, however, developed through the State’s needs to pro-
tect individuals from the misrepresentation of ‘‘fly-by-night”’ schools,
he said. Students would take out loans to pay for courses at a voca,
tional school, decide the program was worthless and lose their money.

It is this development which has forced institutions like Bucknell to
be very careful to avoid misrepresentation, Zeller said.

Chairman and Professor of Education J. William Moore said the
University’s policy is made clear in the Bucknell Bulletin. Following
the description of courses offered by the Education Department, the
Bulletin states, ‘‘Although the Department will advise and assist the
student, it is the responsibility of each student to select courses which
are consistent with the requirements of the State for which he or she is
to be certified.” .

Psychological

motives offered

for bomb threat|'

From PSYCHOLOGICAL, page 1.

The second threat consisted of phone
calls made to three Roberts Hall residents
at 3:23 a.m. Zeller said the calls were pro-
bably prompted by the earlier incident and
that several students from Trax Hall were
identified as the callers, based on the con-
tent of the conversations.

The offenders were referred to the Office
of the Dean of Student Affairs “for
counselling,” according to Zeller, who
refused to release their names. He said the
nature of the threats was not severe
enough to warrant further official action
but refused to disclose additional informa-
tion.

The first incident this school year oc-
curred Oct. 9, when a Phi Gamma Delta
fraternity party was interrupted by a
phone threat. The caller said the party
“was going to blow up.” Lewisburg Police
arrived minutes after they were called at
about 1 a.m. The house was evacuated and
searched for explosive devices, but none
were found.

The University’s response in each case
has been to treat the calls ‘“‘as the real
thing,” evacuate the building, and per-
form a limited -search, according to
Associate Director of Residential Life
Gerry Commerford. ‘‘Our first respon-
sibility is the safety of students,” he said.
“Fortunately, all the calls have been
pranks,”’ Commerford said.

Prompted mainly by the Roberts Hall in-
cidents, Zeller said that the University’s
bomb threat policy was extensively
reviewed as part of a complete new edition
of the official emergency procedures
manual, which was distributed this week.

Cebul gave a lecture on the tamarin—an endangere:

The new policy outlines steps for notify-
ing officials for evacuation, calling the
police and fire departments, and calling
ranking University officials. After con-
sultation at the scene, officials decide what
action should be taken, such as a full
search or a search of public areas.

The policy also states that individuals
must remain out of’ the building for a
minimum of two hours following evacua-
tion and the reported hour of detonation,
and that they can then reenter at their own
risk.

Commerford speculated on the causes
for each of the incidents. ‘‘The PhiGamma
Delta call could have been made by
someone distraught with the fraternity,
and the Hunt Hall incident may have been
directed at the sorority system, since it oc-
curred right at the end of sorority rush,”
he said. Commerford also said the Roberts
Hall threat was probably made to relieve

pre-exam tension and “‘to have a party.”

Both Commerford and Zeller stressed the
severity of the disruptions to the residents,
and that the University would harshly
discipline anyone caught. Zeller said there
were no leads in any of the incidents other
than the second set of calls to Roberts Hall.
He also said that more than five years ago
the University was able to trace a bomb
threat caller who had made repeated
calls from his campus extension, resulting:
in the student’s prosecution and dismissal.

Professor and Head of Psychology
Ernest Keen analyzed the recent incidents
in a Bucknellian interview, attributing the
behavior to “the common emotions of
anger, resentment and jealousy.”

“These are simple motivations that we
all experience,” Keen said. ‘‘The problem
is that most of us check our impulses. It’s a
real puzzle why these people weren’t in-
hibited — but at least they didn’t actually

eys, a primate only eight inches in length when fully developed.
d species because of the destruction of their natural habitat

plant a bomb.”

Keen offered three possible explanations
for this different manifestation of emo-
tions. ‘First, things like this happen in
epidemics; one occurrence prompts
another, as in race riots and mental
hospital suicides,” he said. “Secondly, we
can’t overlook the thrill and power gained
by the caller. Most of us know it’s a cheap
thrill, however.”

Keen also said that when traditional
channels for venting angry motives are in-
effective, a person is driven away and
satisfies his needs through behavior such
as the bomb threats.

“The common reaction is that these
threats are committed by deranged
psychopaths,” Keen said. ‘‘However, this
is totally false. They are people with the
same emotions as the rest of us, who, for
some reason, have chosen to express them
in this manner.”

Now comes
Millertime.

Civil guard ends
parliament takeover

A group of right-wing Civil
Guards seized the lower house of
the Spanish parliament Monday
as members were approving
Spain’s new government.

Many of the 347 members of the
Congress of Deputies as well as
an undetermined number of
senators present at the roll-call
vote were held as hostages.

At about the same time, many
troops with tanks briefly took
control of the state-owned televi-
sion station outside Madrid.

Early Tuesday morning, King
Juan Carlos appeared on televi-
sion (after it had been retaken by
loyal troops) denouncing the
seizure of Parliament and pledg-
ing his faith in democracy.

The uprising ended Tuesday,
after 18 hours.

one of the world’s most eligible
bachelors, will marry Spencer,
19, in late July.

NYU, Dartmouth

appoint new heads

Two non-academics were
selected this week to fill positions
as presidents of leading univer-
sities.

New York University Tuesday
chose former representative
John Brademas, Democrat of In-
diana, to be the school’s 13th
president. David McLaughlin,
chairman of the board of trustees
of Dartmouth College, was
named the school’s 14th president
at a special meeting in Boston
Monday.

Brademas, a 53 year-old Har-
vard graduate, was an 11-term
congressman. He was active in
helping pass the Federal pro-
grams to provide tuition grants
and loans to college students

McLaughlin, a 1954 Dartmouth

False memo leads

to damaging story

The Fairleigh Dickinson
University student newspaper
may be in major trouble as a
result of a phony interdepartmen-
tal memo.

The Metro, the student
newspaper at the Madison, N.J.
campus, received an announce-
ment — supposedly from the
University’s psychology depart-

ment — seeking volunteers for an
experiment on the effects of
marijuana and sexual behavior.

The fraudulent announcement
may have libeled the professor
whose name was listed within it.
The memo sought volunteers in
male-female pairs and encour-
aged those attending the experi-
ment to bring sleeping bags and
blankets. It also offered par-
ticipants two hours of psychology
credit.

“Tt was really somebody’s idea
of a cruel joke on this guy,” said
Metro Editor Frank Girardi.

Harris convicted in

murder of Tarnower

Judge Russell Leggett set
March 20 for the sentencing of
Jean Harris who was convicted
Tuesday of second degree
murder in the multiple shooting
of Dr. Herman Tarnower.

Seated at the defense table,
Harris, 57, took the verdict calm-
ly, while two lawyers seated
nearby burst into tears. The
former Madiera School head-
mistress, who was Tarnower’s
companion and lover for 14 years,
will face penalties ranging from a
minimum of 15 years to a max-
imum of 25 years to life in prison.

Harris had testified that Tar-
nower, a cardiologist and Author
of The Complete Scarsdale
Medical Diet, had died in a strug-
gle over the gun she intended to
use for her suicide, but after an
eight day period of deliberations
the jury agreed finally that she
had ‘“‘intentionally’’ murdered
the 69 year-old physician.

Increase in cases
cited by Armbruster

There has been an increase in
the number of cases handled by
the Lewisburg Area district
justice’s office, with a 35 percent
rise in the number of felony and
misdemeanor criminal court
cases heading the list, according
to Justice Leo Armbruster.

“Tt’s hard to tell why there
have been more offenses,” Arm-
bruster said. ‘It might be due to
the economy. It could be the
warmer weather this winter.”
Armbruster made the statement
after he compared the statistics
for Jan. 1 to Feb. 19 with those
from the same period last year.

Summary offenses increased
by 34 percent and civil cases went
up by 9 percent. He said the ma-
jority of these less serious crimes
involved underage drinking and
disorderly condct. Approximate-
ly 30 percent involved parking
and meter violations and other
minor offenses.

Explosive situation

It’s one in the morning on a Saturday and the phone rings. So you
turn down your stereo, stumble to the phone and pick up the
receiver. The person on the other end of the line calmly tells you
your dormitory will be blown clear to Shamokin within a matter of
minutes.

Should you panic and jump out of the window, or should you just
laugh and turn the music back up?

Well, you shouldn’t do either, but we’re afraid that with the near
epidemic run of bomb scares on campus since September, students
may begin treating bomb threats as jokes. We are also afraid
University officials may begin to display a similar nonchalance
toward the threats. This, we suppose, is to be expected when the
threats become little more than periodical ‘bomb drills’; it never-
theless cannot be condoned.

As recently as Friday, a bomb threat was made to Hunt Hall.
Although the building was cleared 10 minutes after the threat, John
Zeller—assuming the call to be a prank—allowed several people to
return to their rooms. The building had not yet been declared safe at
the time.

Bomb threats are serious business and they should be responded
to cautiously. Believe as we may that the callers are crying wolf, we
must not allow this to interfere with what our common sense would
dictate we do. Instead of going back to your party or running scared,
call Campus Security. And let’s hope they and the administration
will respond with similar concern for student safety by not allowing
buildings to be occupied until they are proven safe.

As for the people issuing the terroristic threats, we can only im-
agine who they are and what queer pleasure they receive when they
hide behind their phones.

BS Minutes

The ABS Minutes usually attempt to summarize events of a con-
gressional meeting. They are most often serious, compact and
precise; their function is to inform.

But when ABS Secretary Lon Castle found his minutes reaching
a somewhat disinterested congress, he designed a set of minutes to
amuse, excite and surprise. The result is a series of minutes in-
terspersed with a juvenile assemblage of jokes and false allegations.
These, Castle hopes, will keep our attention long enough to read the
straight stuff.

Whether ‘‘spot the joke’ makes good reading is—of course—a
moot point. What we cannot debate, however, is the very real, very
critical need to publish ABS minutes which solely summarize and in-
form.

No doubt Castle’s heart was in the right place. Unfortunately,
his humor was not. If the ABS congress is too bored or too distracted
to read the minutes of each meeting thoroughly, then perhaps they
need to be reminded of the seriousness of their positions.

Similarly, the administration of the ABS should not allow an
assembly of our student government to be invalidated by the inap-
propriate language or loose construction of its minutes. The minutes
should read like a sincere reflection of ABS activities—not like a
comic book adventure.

Cheap shots

We reluctantly reported two weeks ago that Pennsylvania’s
Gov. Thornburgh would not bet on the passage of any bill to lower
the drinking age here from 21 to 18, and that he would not take the
political risk of “going to the mat”’ with the legislature on such a bill.
That’s too bad; college students—and we know you have heard this a
hundred times before—are adults, and should be treated as such by
any government that taxes, drafts, calls elections or sells liquor.

A government that sells liquor? Sounds strange to those of us
from outside this state. Fortunately, it sounds strange to the gover-
nor as well, and we applaud his proposal to abolish the state-
controlled stores by converting them into private enterprises.

Thornburgh couldn’t be more correct about monopolies being
“not responsive’’ to the customer, and nowhere is that more true
than at 326 Market Street. Those $15,000 a year salesmen have been
surly and condescending to us for years. Let’s throw them out into
the real world, too.

Media should accentuate the positive

To the Editor:

I am writing mainly in
response to the column by Todd
Buchholz in last Friday’s
Bucknellian. While I consider
myself neither Zeus nor a god, I
do hope my suggestions are
enlightening for someone.

While Buchholz spoke casually
of “mobbed fraternity affairs,”
the “boring” routine and the
“fling” versus “link” dilemma,
his examples were one-sided —
what about the money Greeks
raise each year for charity — and

his documentation lacking —
what percentage of contributions
come from Greek alumni?

Yet there is a larger issue here
than whether or not Buchholz, in
imposing his own disapproving
image of Bucknell on his readers,
is affecting their self-image.

For example, consider the In-
sider’s Guide portrayal of
Bucknell, an unflattering account
written by a disgruntled Buck-
nellian. I submit that he was
disgruntled, as most are, because
the media has scrutinized every

Vandals, take no boughs

To the Editor:

I applaud the Bucknellian for speaking out against the shameful ac-
tivity of student vandalism. And I agree that there should be con-
siderable student input to decisions on what to do with fellow students
gone awry. After all, when one Bucknellian commits a crime, we all
pay for it.

But I wonder how effective the University’s ‘“‘probation”’ policy is.
The idea behind any kind of penalty is to make the offender realize
that what he did was wrong and that he shouldn’t do it again. Will
preventing a person from zonking his brain cells with beer for a few
days out of the week tell him that destroying other people’s property is
wrong?

I don’t think so. And I don’t understand Gerald Commerford’s
remark that fraternities must ‘obey the rules of proper conduct
established by the University in the Student Handbook.” If 20-year-old
men need a handbook to tell them that destroying a tree or wrecking
living accommodations is wrong, then this University is in sad shape.

Prof clarifies position

To the Editor:

I would like to correct an er-
roneous impression left by the ar-
ticle on the tuition increase that
appeared in last week’s Buck-
nellian. When I was asked, at the
completion of the meeting of the
Executive Committee, whether I

said nothing about not being im-
pressed with the board’s efforts.

On the contrary, I was then and
am now quite impressed with the
board’s concern and diligence in
working on this issue.

Stephen Becker, Chairman

Planning and Budget Committee
February 24, 981

was satisfied with the faculty
raise, I said, ‘‘No, not entirely.” I

aspect of our modern life, and we
have come up consistently im-
perfect.

Consider the last issue of the
Bucknellian. It contains 23 col-
umn inches devoted to fraternity
probation and vandalism, while
but eight column inches are given
to an alcohol awareness pro-
gram. Yet which subject prom-
ises the greater potential for
positive effects on student
behavior?

Now, this is not to fault the
Bucknellian for what society
deems “newsworthy.” Rather, I
would like to suggest that some
attention needs to be paid to the
potential effects of what is
printed, filmed, reported and
written instead of to its inherent
truth or commercial value.

Therefore, I must feel the solu-
tion is not a second semester rush
or more government spending on
free activities for independents.
The solution is for each one of us
to be a little less critical and a lit-
tle more positive.

Dave Smith ’78

Bucknellian in brief?

To the Editor:

A school newspaper should inform the community of the impor-
tant issues, reflect the feelings of the various groups which com-
pose the student body and provoke its readers into a higher level of
understanding.

The Bucknellian fails on all three counts. The newspaper does not
deal with fundamental issues of the institution; socal tensions, the
hiring and the salary of professors, admissions policy, investments
policy and so on. Thus, the directions which give the University its
form and content are ignored.

The Bucknellian does not reflect the real feelings of the entire stu-
dent body. The overall tone of the newspaper iscomplacency Except
for the ghosts of Alan Levine, Bucky Bison and pre-rape, there are
no hints of any conflicts or tensions in the community. But blacks,
many of the foreign students, many students interested in art,
many students committed to learning — the people who are suppos-
ed to give the school talent and diversity — despise Bucknell. Yet
their frustration and alienation are never discussed inthe school
newspaper.

As opposed to enlightening and interesting its readership, the
Bucknellian stifles its readership. The Bucknellian is as exciting as
a mortician’s speech. We are inundated with trivia, which deadens
the readers, reinforcing complacency. Popular or esoteric curses,
even discussions of sex — the kinds of language and the kinds of
issues which became part of the official culture fifteen years ago —
are forbidden from the Bucknellian.

1am not advocating juvenile exhibitionism or teenage rebellion, I
am advocating an attempt to understand what is going on in the
community, in the country, and in the world. The Bucknellian is the
voice of the students of a university. Today the voice is of Mickey
Mouse.

The problem lies in the structure of the Bucknellian, the attitudes
and unwritten rules of conduct which give the paper its character.
Why is the Bucknellian so complacent? Why is our freedom of
speech so limited? Craig Ullman’81

Student study alleviates congestion

To the Editor:
Caf lines got you down?

As introduced in the Bucknellian two weeks ago, I
have been studying the cafeteria’s congestion pro-
blem since last semester. I will be helping the direc-
tor of the University Dining Service to develop
potential solutions and to implement changes to im-
prove the situation. The system now in use is design-
ed to allow students to move freely from counter to
counter. The problem with the system is that if you
allow too many diners into the service area, you

allow a traffic jam to develop.

The plan we have developed is twofold. First, a
better system for ticket punching will be used which
will ensure fast-pass holders a preference. Second,
the flow of students into the service area will be ad-

Justice for all-
voice for frats

To the Editor:

The recent restricting measures applied
to fraternities seem to reflect the
philosophy of the current Bucknell ad-
ministration. Especially surprising is the
lack of an unbiased intermediary group in
the probationary process. Without equal
arbitration and precedence, the frater-
nities were totally stifled. An important

the advice and inputs of an unbiased
organization? The Interfraternity Council
should be given greater authority to act as
an intermediary in such instances (if not
some other organization). This is not to
justify ‘‘animal house’’-like actions of
fraternities. It is true that fraternities
should be held responsible and liable for
some actions. However, it is only fair to
grant the fraternities equal representation
when such instances occur. The ad-
ministration’s strong anti-fraternity
stance is not just, for it fails to provide
equal representation.

In order for fraternities to abide by the
rules of the administration, it is only fair
that the administration abide by the
democratic principles of justice.

Starting today ticket punching will be done in a
more organized and equitable manner. Only those
holding fast passes will be allowed through the
center doors to the uphill and downhill sides of the
caf. The system is designed to give preference to
those holding fast passes, and will ensure that all
others are treated equitably.

Starting March 4 we will be adjusting the flow of
diners into the service area to avoid overcrowding.
The ticket punchers will slow the inflow so as to
keep movement through the ‘‘scramble” area on
the verge of being congested; this monitoring will
ensure that the flow is maximized at all times.

Curriculum reform capable of setting societal tone

By Phil Andrews

Columbia University President Michael Sovern has said
“A great university can be likened to a great cathedral —
an enduring and soaring monument to the human spirit.
The University differs, however, in that it is never finish-
ed. It is always being built.”

One major building block of Bucknell University, the
curriculum, is likely to undergo major alterations in the
near future. According to Chairman David Ray, the facul-
ty will probably pass curricular reform within two years.

PHILLING IN

EEE

Thus, it would seem most appropriate that students, as

well as administrators and faculty, think deeply about
what we would have Bucknell students know.

Four years ago in Change magazine, Ernest Boyer
(later President Carter’s Education Commissioner) and
Martin Kaplan published a fascinating article entitled,
“Educating For Survival: A Call For a Core Curriculum.”

Init, they propose a core curriculum relevant for all.

First, Boyer and Kaplan observe that we all share a
common heritage. ‘Colleges have an obligation to help
the human race remember where it has been and how, for
better or worse, it got where it is.”

They urge that examination of ‘‘sets of events viewed
from different vantage points,” “human nature” and the
“convergence of political, economic, and intellectual
forces” be included in a core curriculum.

Second, the authors point out that we all confront the
challenges of the present. “General education proposals
have been remarkably inattentive to the commonality in
the contemporary world.”

They add, “Education, while its purpose must always

OPINIONS Friday, February 27, 1981

go beyond work, does not and should not bypass the cen-
trality of work — historically, culturally, and personally.”

Moreover, ‘‘The time has come to give a new objectivi-
ty, anew dignity to work of all kinds; to recognize that col-
lege graduates, instead of being demeaned by all but the

status professions, can in fact lift up a job and give it new REGULATE OR REFLECT aes

meaning.”

Third, Boyer and Kaplan emphasize that we are all
making the future. “Education, indeed, has no higher
ethical commitment than to provide students with a
thorough value-laden preparation for the next century.”

Furthermore, ‘‘The study of the future should involve
those acts inherent in all scholarship: the search for en-
during values, the exposure of hidden assumptions, and
the confronting of value-laden choices.”

Fourth, Boyer and Kaplan argue that we are partisans
— that we all make ethical choices.

“For too long colleges and universities have suggested
to students that beliefs are somehow less important than

“the facts.’ But regardless of the pretensions of its
member disciplines and the magisterial rhetoric of the
college catalogue, the university acts out the choices and
commitments it has made.

“None of these choices is ‘natural.’ All are human-
made, subject to revision, born of values, inherently con-
troversial, and rooted in time and place and economy and
faith.”

Boyer and Kaplan conclude, “. . . we have maintained
that the movement away from the required classical core
and toward do-it-yourself electives has been informed by,
and has contributed to, the hypertrophy of individualism.
We have proposed instead a new curriculum based on the
irreducible commonalities of our existence.”

The late Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. used to lament that
most people and institutions are thermometers rather
than thermostats — reflecting, rather than setting the
tone of the society.

Bucknell, through curricular reform, has an opportuni-
ty to serve as a thermostat for our society. Let us do so.

groups consisting mostly of pirates.
Among the attractions:

The Best Weather. Average temperature is 70° Farenheit. The best beaches. Paradise Island could easily

be one of the world’s most beautiful. Freeport too!

The best hangouts. Old forts and buildings, modern night spots, lively markets and good restaurants.
The best accommodations for the money. These people are wonderful hosts. Your hotel will have con-

siderable charm and comfort.

And the best people. Bahamians depend on visitors for their livelihood. So, even though they're friendly
to begin with, they'll make an extra effort to shake the hand that feeds them. All things considered, there's

one way you're not going to have a really good time.

In ‘A Faun in the Forest’, students spoof grand traditions

By LYNNE RUTHERFORD

What happens when a fair lady
must choose between a dull
knight and a handsome faun? The
Bucknell Opera Workshop, under
the direction of Assistant Pro-
fessor of Music Justin Kelly, will
address itself to this intriguing
question at 8:15 p.m. Tuesday in
the University Center Forum.

act spoof of grand opera by
Gerald Cockshott, parodies all
the elements of more traditional
works. There’s @ maiden

Because of the scarcity of

auditioned singers in late

Lengthy rehearsals were Te-

then acquire and refine charac-

dience’s delight; the performer’s sarcastic remarks
helped to make the audience more comfortable and
relaxed on the gym floor.

Gradually, more performers came onstage,
beginning with Kenny Asher on keyboards. After
two songs, bass guitarist Andy Muson and drummer
Rick Marotto strolled onto the stage.

The band came to an end of the first set with their
classic “Fire and Rain,” a top ten hit in the early
70s. The lights were turned on as they took a short
preak. The second and slightly shorter set was
much more upbeat, contrasting well with the
mellow songs played earlier in the evening. All of
his major hits were played during this set, including

“Carolina on My Mind,” all audience favorites.
They played only one encore, put most of Taylor’s
better known songs were performed during the
evening.

Security at Bloomsburg was very strict. Although
there was no frisking at the door, the guards pa-
trolled the crowd and approached many students
preaking the “No Smoking” rule. In addition, the
acoustics of the Bloomsburg gym were excellent
and seemed to be far better than at the Southside
Johnny concert here last October.

Despite Hawn, “Private Benjamin’ hits and misses

By BRUCE BOWEN

“Private Benjamin” has the
potential of being a classic com-
edy movie. Good actors with ade-
quate performances and a decent
story line are both present. That
special ingredient necessary for
a contemporary classic, though,
is missing.

The real problem with this
movie is not that it lacks humor,
for there are some scenes which

are quite funny. For some
reason, it simply does not hold
together as a tight comedy, or
even an above average film.
Maybe the genre has been simply
saturated with too many movies
in all forms of humor.

The plot centers around the
misfortunes of an upper class
Jewish misfit named Judy Ben-
jamin (Goldie Hawn). We see a
scene on her second wedding

night where her husband dies on
the bathroom floor. Before the
plot ever really gets a chance to
develop, Benjamin has buried
two husbands and been coerced
into joining ‘“‘Today’s Army,”’ or,
as she puts it, ‘the one with the
condos and sailboats.’’

Predictably, she encounters
the ogre-like drill sergeant and
the buxom gorilla-types whose
ways she cannot understand and
has no desire to ever experience.
Again, predictably, her naive
charm gets her and her unit into
trouble.

reassignment, where she falls in
love with a communist and even-
tually drops the Army so that she
can marry him.

The conclusion of this story,
which on review looks to be
rather like a soap opera’s,
somehow does not do Goldie
Hawn or anybody else in the
movie justice. In the final
analysis, we begin with a quiet,
nocent, unlucky, naive rich girl
and end up with an unlucky, less
innocent, less naive rich girl. No
character changes are really
even worth mentioning.

Hawn does do a remarkably
good job in portraying Benjamin,
especially in her innocent con-
flicts with the drill sergeant and
her other superiors. Eileen Bren-
nan also, as that sergeant, shows
great comedic prowess in the

role. Both these actresses — pro-
bably deservingly — have been
nominated for Academy Awards
for their work.

In the final analysis, the pro-
blem with “Private Benjamin” is
that it is one of the few movies
that this writer has seen which he
simply disliked, without being
able to easily explain why,
especially in light of the film’s
third nomination, this time for
best screenplay.

“Private Benjamin” does have
some quite funny spots, some de-
cent acting and is definitely
worth seeing once. But it is not
the kind of movie one will rave
about as one of the year’s
greatest.

Low rent on the Buffalo Road location helps to keep her prices down.

Five Points hoagie serves challenge
to all other grinders in the area

By PAM RUSSO

Four blocks north of Market Street, on the cor-
ner of Buffalo Road and St. Anthony Street, lies
Five Points Market, the home of the cheap hoagie.

On first inspection, Five Points Market looks
like nothing more than an old time mom and pop
corner grocery. It is exactly that, with the added
appeal of excellent grinders.

Owner Doris Blanford cordially greets you as
you enter the market. As you peruse the rows of
shelves, the limited size of the store enables you to
make a quick inventory of the goods. Still, the
range of wares is adequate for this store’s
neighborhood clientele; this place is everything
the corner grocery used to be.

Every day at noon, a stream of regulars come to
claim their lunchtime hoagie. Many of these are
such consistent customers that Blanford knows
what to make without asking. Mrs. Heatter, who
asks you to call her Dorothy, is the only other
employee, unless you count the neighbors who
lend a hand to keep Five Points open when Blan-

ford goes on vacation.

Hanging behind the cash register are two signs
indicating the selection of twelve cold and three
cooked hoagies. The prices are lower than the
Lewisburg norm for sandwiches and the quantity
is not lacking.

A small is easily as filling as one and a half
hoagies from the Bison: from $1 for a small
regular hoagie to $1.45 for a small roast beef, Five
Point’s prices are reasonable. Lower price usually
means lower quality, but here is an exception. The
roast beef, hams, cheeses and rolls are fresh and
appetizing. The store owner says that the St. An-

thony Street location allows for lower rent and
therefore lower sub prices.

Five Points is open Monday through Friday
from 7 a.m. until 9 p.m. and weekends from 10
a.m. until 7 p.m. There is no delivery service, but
you can call 524-0304 to place an order. Why not

Artist in residence O’Grady
begins month long stay here

Not to be overshadowed by the visit of renowned musician Jean-
Pierre Rampal is the residency of Irish violinist Geraldine O’Grady,
who arrived on campus Sunday and will remain until March 24.

O’Grady, referred to Bucknell by arrangement of New York music
impresario Julius Bloom, comes with plentiful laurels. Born in Dublin
and educated at the Conservatoire National Superieur de Muzique in
Paris, O’Grady is a violinist of the first rank. After winning several
major European music awards, she gained the position of soloist with
the Irish National Orchestra, the highest honor in her country.

Since leaving Ireland to pursue a solo career, O’Grady has toured
with the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, the Boston Pops Orchestra
and the London Symphony Orchestra. She has recently completed a
recital tour of Brazil.

During her first performace on Tuesday, the violinist lived up to her
billing. As the New York Daily News wrote of her artistry, “‘O’Grady
proved herself a major artist—her tone is splendidly full yet never at
the cost of its fundamental sweetness.”

O’Grady, who includes many traditional Irish airs in her repertoire,
has been joining the University Orchestra for rehearsals and master
classes since her arrival. “Blectrifying,”’ was the word one orchestra
member used to describe the impact of her playing. O’Grady’s next
performance is March 14.

ECC basketball race a toss-up

By KEN QUAAS

The thunder of the crowd
stopped as suddenly as if it was
struck by lightning Wednesday
night as a hustling Lehigh basket-
ball squad squeaked by the
Breakin’ Bisons in the last four
seconds of play, 63-62. The
Engineer victory upped Lehigh’s
East Coast Conference Western
Division record to 69 while
lowering Bucknell’s to the same.
Lehigh’s victory moved them into
a second place tie with the
Bisons.

The Bisons matched 6-8 records
with Rider after besting them
Saturday and attained a three
way tie with the Broncos and
Lafayette for the top spot in the

division. But Wednesday saw
Rider nail West Chester, 82-65,
and left them in a first place lock
with Lafayette — which barely
toppled cellar-dwelling Delaware
by a score of 65-64.

Saturday’s contests will tell
which teams will gain the final
top positions in the heated
Western Division. Rider faces
Lehigh at Stabler Arena in
Bethlehem while the Bisons
square off against Lafayette for
the third time this season and the
first at home.

The Bisons were blown out of
Charlottesville in their first
meeting with the Leopards this
year in the Virginia Tipoff

November. The cagers sport an
impressive 5-3 record for
February, however, while scor-
ing a 56-53 drubbing of Lafayette
in Easton and two victories over
first place Rider.

If both Bucknell and Lehigh
win Saturday, there will be a
four-way tie in the division for
first, as all of the top four teams
will have 7-9 records. The divi-
sion playoffs will begin this week
and a loss Saturday would make
things even stickier for the
Bisons as they would have to play
again Monday night. A win would
mean a bye until Wednesday.

“Coach Woollum and I will be
rooting for each other on Satur-
day,” said Lehigh’s Coach Brian
Hill, who would offer no predic-
tions as to the outcome of the
twisted divisional mess — or
which two teams would face the
seemingly indomitable Eastern
Division leaders in the ECC
Championships at the Palestra in
Philadelphia, March 6-7. A
Lehigh victory would excuse the
Engineers from play until
Wednesday as well.

The powerful East Division has
American sitting comfortably on
top with a 10-0 conference record
after turning back talented St.
Joseph’s 84-83 in overtime Tues-
day.

Swimmers are slow

off blocks in ECC s

By STEVEN MEDOFF

“Tt is the biggest meet of the
season” according to Men’s
Swimming Team Captain Pat
Mitchell ’81 speaking of this
weekend’s East Coast Con-
ference championship meet at
LaSalle.

The swimmers got off to a sur-
prisingly slow start, ending the
first day of competition in fifth
place. LaSalle streaked to an ear-
ly lead with 158 points, followed
by Lehigh (92), Drexel and Tem-
ple.

The 400-yard medley relay
team of seniors Chris Layton,
Mark Gensheimer and Mare Corl
and sophomore Dave Wakely
were expected to win but were
edged by both LaSalle and Tem-
ple. Anchor man Corl was touch-
ed out in the freestyle leg, pulling
in with a 3:31.842 clocking.

The 500-yard freestyle was
another disappointment as no
Bisons qualified for the final as
was expected. Mitchell and
sophomores Tim Jenkins and
Dave Gassert swept the consola-
tion final by finishing seventh
through ninth, respectively.

LaSalle increased their ad-
vantage by outscoring Bucknell

33-4 in the 200-yard individual
medley.

Corl recorded his personal best
in the 50 freestyle by finishing se-
cond in the preliminaries in
21.254. A poorly executed turn
caused Corl to finish fourth in the
finals with a 21.748 mark. Dan
Dougherty °82 placed tenth in
92.11, also a personal best time.

Tim Critchfield ’83 was the only
Bison to crack the top 12 in one-
meter diving by placing 11th.

The meet continues this even-
ing with six finals and concludes
tomorrow with the final seven
events.

Capping their regular season
with Saturday’s 80-33 romp over
Lehigh, the Bisons glided into the
ECC finals with an 8-3 dual meet
record, Bucknell’s best since the
’74-’75, 9-1 season.

Bucknell had won the ECC
championship nine straight years
until losing the title to LaSalle by
228 points last season. “Bringing
it back home is what it’s all
about,” Mitchell said.

Bucknell and LaSalle, both
with 8-3 records, are favorites in
the conference meet. Head Coach
Dick Russell said, ‘It could be
either team’s meet with a final

score difference of less than 20
points.”

One important factor in the
meet is the overall quality of
swimmers in the league. Russell
commented, ‘‘The conference
has vastly improved this year
and that will play a key part in
determining the winner.” Russell
also said that other teams may
knock Bison and Explorer swim-
mers out of high scoring positions
with strong showings in the
preliminaries.

“Our biggest strength is our
depth” which will give the Bisons
the edge over LaSalle in the
ECC’s, according to Mitchell.

In Bucknell’s rout over Lehigh
Saturday, the swimmers avenged
last year’s 62-51 loss — a meet for
which Lehigh shaved and
tapered. Russell commented,
“The team as a whole swam very
well.”

The 400 medley relay team set
a new pool record with a 3:35.53
clocking.

Wrestlers gain 2d

By KEN QUAAS

Coach Bob Ferraro can walk through the corridors of the
Sports/Recreation Complex and smell sweet success for the second
straight year.

By smashing both Rider and Lafayette in Easton Saturday, the
wrestling team pinned down a 9-8 overall record to make this its se-
cond consecutive winning season—an accomplishment not seen on the
Bison mats since 1963. In swiping the tri-meet with a 32-12 victory over
Rider and a 27-18 win over Lafayette, the grapplers were also able to
finish in a lock for second place in East Coast Conference dual meet
competition, matching 5-2 records with Lafayette.

Frontrunning West Chester boasts a 6-1 conference record and will
provide stiff competition for the Bisons today and Saturday in the ECC
Championships.

Ferraro leads a young but strong team onto the Lafayette mats
this weekend—a squad that finished its regular season by spending the
last three Saturdays sweeping three straight tri-meets. Rutgers,
Franklin & Marshall and conference rivals American and Delaware
have all fallen victim to Bucknell’s February surge.

Making their second trip in a week to Easton, the Bisons will aim
for the success of the first.

Captain Doug Mays ’81 will take an overall 21-4 record to the
tourney, where Bucknell finished a disappointing fourth last year.
Mays has finished third at 126 the past two years and, along with junior

Steve Greenly—1979 champ at 177 and runnerup last season at 158—he
is Bucknell’s best bet to capture an individual championship in the
conference match.

Hofstra grabbed the ECC’s last year as it has the past six, but the
Flying Dutchmen graduated all but one of their five wrestlers who
were crowned individual champions last February in Davis Gym.

Ferraro said the squad has “the potential to place everyone in the
top four’’ and said he expects to “battle West Chester and Lafayette
down to the wire” for the title. Bucknell has never won the conference
match but finished a surprising second in 1979.

Lehigh tops Bisons on last-second shot

First place showdown Saturday

By JEFF CROSS

In a span of seven seconds, the mood of
the near-capacity crowd in Davis Gym for
Wednesday’s basketball clash between the
Breakin’ Bisons and Lehigh turned from
jubilant to sour.

Senior playmaker Dave Shehadi had
given Bucknell a 62-61 lead on an 18-foot
jumper with seven seconds left to cap what
seemed to be a remarkable late-game
surge that would virtually assure the
Bisons a bye in the first round of the East
Coast Conference playoffs commencing
Monday.

Indeed, when Shehadi’s hustle caused
the Engineers to turn over the ball on a full
court press with five seconds remaining,
the boisterous assemblage shrieked with
delight at the prospect of a third straight
trip to the Palestra for the ECC finals
March 6-7.

But Lehigh, with lightning quickness,
brought a disbelieving hush over the gym.
First, Bucknell lost possession and the op-
portunity to run out the clock when a
Lehigh defender deflected the ensuing in-
bounds pass off Shehadi’s arm and out of
bounds.

Then, after using their final timeout,
Lehigh’s Mike Power received a pass at
center court, spun and fed high-scorer
Kevin Riley racing uncovered toward the
basket. Riley pulled up ten feet from the
hoop as the final seconds ticked away and
banked in a jumper off the glass back-
board to set off a wild celebration on the
visitors’ bench and stun the home crowd
just as 0:00 showed on the clock.

Lehigh Head Coach Brian Hill said, “‘It
was a set play designed for three-quarter
court inbounds play. We’ve been practic-
ing it since the beginning of the year.”

Keying the Engineers’ victory were a
remarkable 70 percent (17-24) shooting ac-
curacy for the second half and a 28-27 re-
bounding edge over the Bisons. In
Bucknell’s 54-44 win over Lehigh Feb. 7 in
Bethlehem, the Engineers were outre-
bounded by 20 caroms.

In addition, Lehigh held Bison team cap-
tain Al Leslie— the squad’s leading scorer
with a 19.7 points per game average —
scoreless for the final 15 minutes. Using a
swarming zone defense, the Engineers
limited Leslie to six for 21 shooting and 13

points, 10 of them in the first half.

The game remained close in the early
going, with the teams trading baskets
throughout most of the first half. Bucknell
entered the locker room with a 25-24 lead.

Lehigh assumed command early. in the
second half and, using rapid movement
and pinpoint passing, took a slim lead. The
Engineers assumed the biggest lead of the
game, 57-52, when Riley connected on two
of his game high 19 points with four
minutes left.

Two crucial, long range jumpers by Paul
Adkins ’81 and a layin of a Leslie miss by
center Deb Okorodudu ’82 tied the game at
58 with two minutes showing. Following a
Lehigh free throw, Shehadi canned an 18-
footer to give the Bisons a 60-59 lead, their
first since the start of the half, with only 50
seconds jeit to set the stage for the
dramatic conclusion.

Forward Ray Moss ’83 led Bucknell in
scoring with 18 points and rebounds with
seven while Okorodudu chipped in with 11
points and Shehadi and Mike Page ’81
added eight markers apiece. The Bisons
shot 47 percent (26-55) from the field and 71
percent (10-14) from the free-throw line.

The JV upped its record to 11-3 with a
57-55 overtime victory over its Lehigh
counterparts. Mike Ferguson ’83,. who
finished with a game-high 16 points, gave
Bucknell the win with a last-second
jumper.

The hoopsters traveled to Lawrence-
ville, N.J. Saturday to face Rider in
another important conference battle and
emerged with a come-from-behind 65-61
win.

After trailing for most of the afternoon,
Bucknell took a 55-54 lead with 2:59 left on
an Adkins jump shot and then used clutch
foul shooting to secure the victory. Leslie
— who extended his streak to 59 of 64 free
throws in the last nine games —
Okorodudu, Page and Adkins all hit both
ends of one-and-one situations in the last
two minutes.

Okorodudu was the leading Bison scorer
with 16 points, followed by Leslie with 14
and Page and Moss with 10 apiece.

Women’s Track sets

eight new records

By S. J. FURMAN

Sporting a 4-1 record and qualifying nearly 20 competitors for the
East Coast Conference Championships, the women’s Indoor Track
team hosted the Bucknell Open Saturday and posted its most im-
pressive performance this season.

Ten teams participated in the all day event, highlighted by strong
representatives from SUNY at Binghamton, Lock Haven, Villanova
and Cornell. For Bucknell, the day proved quite rewarding; eight
Bucknell records were set while two others were tied. Commenting on
Bucknell’s showing, Coach Diane Ware was particularly pleased with
junior Co-Captain Linda Accettura’s record half-mile (2:18.8),
freshman Nancy Russo’s second place finish in the long jump and
junior Suzanne Hecker’s third place in the 600-meter run.

Russo also established Bucknell records in the 60-yd. and 220-yd.
dashes, posting times of 7.4 seconds and 27.4 seconds, respectively.
Sophomore Lonnie Fertik turned in an impressive performance in the
pentathalon, placing third with a Bucknell high of 3091 points. Finally,
the two mile relay team captured a close fourth place finish in a record
20:00.7.

Joining the 12 Bisons who have already qualified for the EAIAW
Division II Championships Mar. 7-8 at Harvard were Deborah
Passmore ’84 and Laura Gaydos ’83 in the one-mile run, while Accet-
tura and Russo became eligible for the 880-yd. run and long jump,
respectively. According to Beth Bittel ’83, the team is “excited about

the Easterns because close to twenty (opposed to four last year) will
be competing in Boston.” “That shows incredible improvement and
potential,” Furtik commented.

The Bisons close their season against Lock Haven at 1 p.m. Saturday
in the Sports/Recreation Complex.

OK unanimous

for arts

credits

By LAURIE McGREW

A proposal to award credit to
students who participate in cer-
tain performing arts groups here
was unanimously approved by
the University Committee on In-
struction Tuesday.

The committee voted at a
breakfast meeting to recommend
to the full faculty that credit ‘in
varying amounts, usually one
quarter course credit per
semester, be awarded for
satisfactory participation in
courses” in music, art, dance and
theater productions.

This credit would be limited to
activities involving some amount
of academic discipline that are
taught by members of the facul-
ty, according to the proposal,
which will be rewritten by In-

Military programs criticized by committee

By MADELON HENEHAN
and MATT KARANIAN

The Central Committee for Conscientious
Objectors has accused the military programs
at Bucknell and all other American colleges
and universities of misrepresentation.

Students are misled to believe there is an
advantage for enlistees and that they will
receive valuable training while in the
military, according to CCCO Director of Pre-
Enlistment Counseling Larry Spears.

Spears said “loopholes in the enlistment
contract’’ put the enlistee at a ‘distinct disad-
vantage, and in fact, offer very few
guarantees.”’

The ‘‘ramifications”’ of military enlistment
are explained ‘‘implicitly’ to students, ac-
cording to University Military Science Cap-

tain Michael Thornburg, however. He said he
tells students ‘exactly what they’re signing
up for.”’

Since ‘‘verbal promises are often made by
recruiters,’ however, Spears said “‘if the
military should not come through with what
the recruiter promised, the enlistee has no
legal recourse.”

Spears also said ‘‘many important sounding
job titles, such as combat engineer, turn out
to be dull, meaningless jobs with no applica-
tion to civilian positions.”

He said the training is therefore ‘often
useless after you get out of the military” since
the jobs have no civilian counterpart.

The University’s Army Reserve Officer
Training Corps (ROTC) currently has 50
students enrolled here.

Right to take pictures is
approved by the faculty

The Bucknellian has won back the right to photograph the Univer-
sity’s faculty meetings—a right that had been officially denied the

newspaper since 1966.

After a heated debate at the meeting Monday, a motion by Pro-

More than half of them receive financial aid
from the University. Under the ROTC pro-
gram, after signing a contract with the Army,
students not on scholarship receive $2500 in
financial aid over a two year period, Thorn-
burg said.

Although students have no obligation to the
Army and may discontinue ROTC training at
any time during their first two years,
sophomores must decide whether or not to
sign a contract for the remaining two years.

Signing the contract obligates scholarship
cadets to four years of active duty and to two
years in the Army Reserve. Graduates not on
scholarship may serve three years on active
duty and the remaining three years in the
reserve.

struction Committee member
and Visiting Assistant Professor
of Music Christopher McGahan
for presentation to the faculty for
final decision at its April
meeting.

Credit given for courses in the
arts currently included in the cur-
riculum would not be affected.

If the faculty votes to imple-
ment the plan, each department
would have to create courses—
such as “Orchestra 215”—which
would then be added to the
University Catalogue and
scheduled by students in the
same manner as a course in any
other discipline. Most of these
newly-created courses would
then offer one-quarter credit per
semester, although half-credit
and three-quarter credit courses
are also possible, according to
the proposal.

This proposal has the support
of members of the Music, Dance
and Art Departments and the
theatre and drama faculty,
because they say it would offer an
incentive to students who would
like to participate in such groups
and productions but do not
because of academic com-
mitments, the proposal said.
Assistant Professor of Physical
Education Nora Elze—who
teaches dance—said, “I’m in
favor of credit for performing
arts-type courses.”

McGahan said many colleges

fessor of Spanish Mills Edgerton that will allow the public meetings of
the faculty to be photographed at least until the end of the year, was
approved by an unrecorded voice vote.

“While I consider myself to be completely unphotogenic,” Edger-
ton said, ‘I can see absolutely no reason why we should prohibit the
Bucknellian from exercising its right to free speech by recording our
actions however it sees fit.”’

A number of the 78 voting faculty members were concerned to
discover that their meetings were entirely open—‘‘anybody can walk
in,” according to Professor of Mathematics and Faculty Chairman
David Ray—and still more attempted to limit the photographs by
creating an amendment that would have limited photographer’s time,
ability to move and ability to take flash photographs. The amendment
was defeated.

Assistant Professor of Physics Stephen Becker, who seconded the
Edgerton motion, said “‘we should not try and write an old-fashioned
insurance policy” by putting such limits on the cameramen.

Bucknellian Editor David Hawkings ’82 had asked Ray to request
for the rescinding of the 15-year-old prohibition, which was created

Former Peace Corps Director listens to a question after his
lecture, “Peace Corps or War Corps,” Monday night in the
University Center Forum. A slideshow on the organization
followed his presentation.

US empathy supported
by Peace Corps’ Celeste

By MELISSA BAIR

“National security in the next two decades will demand the ap-
plication of the kinds of skills that the Peace Corps has been
about,” according to former Peace Corps Director Richard
Celeste, who spoke to an audience of 150 Monday night in the
University Center Forum.

The Peace Corps’ 20th anniversary this year has prompted a con-
templation of its function in the poorest countries of the world,
Celeste said.

According to Celeste, America no longer lives in a bi-polar world
— one in which the United States and Soviet Union are considered
the only major powers — but is one of the many major powers. If
the United States is not ‘‘sensitive to the languages and values that
people are shoring up around the world, we will not know much
about what is going on,”’ he said.

Celeste said. Peace Corps volunteers must “learn to listen and
listen to learn in order to share in the process of change.”

In addition, Celeste said the best ‘“‘survival skills” for the United
States are to allow underdeveloped countries to choose their own
paths of development.

Appointed Peace Corps Director in 1979 by former President
Carter, Celeste supervised programs involving nearly 6,000
volunteers in 63 developing countries. He is a Rhodes Scholar and
graduate of Yale University, and was also a former ambassador to
India and lieutenant governor of Ohio.

Following the lecture was a slide show given by Lois and Brian
Redmond, two Peace Corps volunteers who worked in the
Dominican Republic for five years. The presentation portrayed
their experience in the Peace Corps.

Celeste also gave a talk to prospective Peace Corps volunteers in
Carey House Monday afternoon. His visit and lecture, entitled
“Peace Corps or War Corps?,’’ was sponsored by the Bucknell Stu-
dent Lectureship.

University’s sexual harassment policy
released by office of the president

By STEVE GARFINKEL

“Sexual Harassment Policy and Complaint Pro-
cedures,” a policy statement describing the Univer-
sity’s definition of sexual harassment and pro-
cedure for dealing with it, has been released by the
Office of the President.

The statement is written in two forms — one that
applies to students and one applying to employees.

The documents define sexual harassment as ‘“‘the
subjugation of a person to inappropriate verbal or
physical sexual attraction, the coercion of a person
into a sexual relationship, or retaliation for a
refusal to comply with sexual demands.”’

According to Assistant to the Provost and Af-
firmative Action Officer Judith Becker, who drafted
the document, the creation of the policy was sup-
ported by Title VII of The Civil Rights Act of 1964.
Becker said that such policies are encouraged
under Title IX of the 1972 Educational Amend-
ments, which discourages sex discrimination.

The documents were written under the guidelines
of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
(EEOC) and signed by University President
dent Dennis O’Brien.

The EEOC has “‘long recognized sexual harass-
ment as a violation of Title VII of The Civil Rights
Act,” Becker said.

Vice President for Administration and Finance
John Zeller said the policy “‘came from a review of
the University’s legal posture’’ on this subject.

Becker and Zeller both said there are currently no
cases of harassment of this type under review at the
University.

Zeller named legal suits brought against pro-
fessors by students at other colleges and the movie
“9 to 5’ as examples of sexual harassment and the
need for ‘‘appropriate dean or administrator.” If
the complaint cannot be ‘‘resolved,’’ a written state-
ment may be submitted to a Grievance Committee
available to the complainant under the University’s
Affirmative Action plan.

The statement will become part of the Universi-
ty’s stated Grievance Procedure. Becker said she
views the policy as a precautionary measure and
hopes she will not have to use it. Neither Becker nor
Zeller is aware of any reaction from students or
faculty here concerning the policy.

TALKING OVER THE MAJOR—Only about 20 of the more than 100 potential sophomore
biology majors discuss the requirements for the degree Monday afternoon in the Taylor
Building lecture hall with Professor of Biology Hulda Magalhaes. Freshmen were also in-
vited to the interest meetings offered by the 27 academic departments at the University,
but only a handful decided not to wait until their second year before finding out what to

expect after a major is officially declared.

O’Brien recommends a committee on budget policy

By BILL THUM

The formation of a special subcommittee of the
University Board of Trustees on salary and wage policy
was recommended by University President Dennis
O’Brien at the faculty meeting Monday.

Following the six month debate on this year’s budget,
O’Brien said guidelines are needed to provide both a basis
and direction for discussions of wages and salaries in the
future.

The recommendation, currently in the ‘“‘draft’”’ stage,
states, ‘In the past, more explicit guidelines were real-
ly as necessary as they have now become.”’ Whereas 10
years ago, Bucknell salaries ranked 16th out of the univer-
sity’s 17 frame of reference schools, the position has im-

\\ proved to 7th in 1979-80, O’Brien said. Since the old policy
of “improvement” has been achieved, O’Brien said, some
new criterion for decisionmaking is necessary.

In an interview, O’Brien differentiated between two
types of guidelines that could be used. The first choice
would be to select a rough position within a relative group

vers ee ee ey ee rawewnee

to strive for. Lehigh University uses this policy in striving
for the upper third ranking of engineering institutions,
O’Brien said.

Likewise, O'Brien said, Gettysburg College uses the
American Association of University Professors’ wage and
salary index and aims to be at the top of its category.
Through the use of a ranking system within a relative
group of institutions, a level of flexibility can be main-
tained allowing for many variables to be accounted for,
O’Brien said.

The second approach is to take some economic in-
dicator and generate a set of guidelines from it. Col-
gate University is one that uses this policy. Basically, it
would entail identifying an indicator, such as the Personal
Disposable Income or Consumer Price Index and increase
tuition, or wages and salaries, by a like amount, O’Brien
said.

The benefit of using the P.D.I. as an indicator,
O’Brien said, is that the family’s ability to pay will be
taken into consideration.

O’Brien said he personally preferred the first method
of determining a range of wage and salary levels to strive
for. He said he is wary of a formula based on external in-
dicators because not only might they not reflect the
special needs of the institution, but they also might not ac-
curately predict the ability of families to weather such in-
creases.

While the formation of such a committee is as of yet
only a recommendation, O’Brien said it was favorably
discussed at the trustees’ executive committee meeting
Feb. 19. It also has the support of Chairman of the Faculty
David Ray and University Committee for Planning and
the Budget. Chairman Stephen Becker. O’Brien expects
Trustees Chairman Charles Baird to appoint a trustee
subcommittee before the May meeting of the Board, and
the establishment of a University committee on wage and
salary guidelines to occur soon.

“Hopefully, this will eliminate much of the
‘numerology’ which currently exists in budget formula-

tion,”’ O’Brien said.

The Association of Bucknell
Students Appropriations Com-
mittee has recently allocated 60
percent of the funds requested by
10 student organizations follow-
ing a series of appeals.

Both the Indoor Soccer and
Ultimate Frisbee Clubs chal-
lenged the original cuts made by
the committee at its Feb. 17
meeting, ABS Vice President
Missy Campbell ’82 said.

The committee initially denied
the funds to the Indoor Soccer
Club on the grounds that it is too
much like a varsity or junior var-
sity sport — which the ABS does
not financially support — ABS
treasurer Andy Brody ’82 said.
The committee was also con-
cerned that there was no open
advertisement for students to
participate in the club, Brody
said.

Team member Sunil Gulati ’81
appealed the decision, saying
that indoor soccer is not recog-
nized by the NCAA and thus does
not obtain funds for tournaments
that other NCAA sanctioned
sports receive. Gulati also placed
an appeal in ‘‘What’s Happen-
ing’”’ for new student participa-
tion in compliance with ABS
guidelines.

For these reasons, the commit-
tee reconsidered its decision and
appropriated $584 for the club.

Although the Ultimate Frisbee
Club received $1,498 of the $3,534
that it requested, the decision of
the committee to disallow ap-
proximately $2381 — ear-marked
for a trip to Florida for competi-
tion — caused the members to ap-
peal, according to club Treasurer
Eric Suber ’81. The club
presented an amended request to
the committee Feb. 24 for a
University van, station wagon
and money for gas to drive the

Page 4 NEWS Friday, March 6, 1981
_| $7966 is allocated by the ABS

club to its meets in Florida, Suber
said.

Although the committee de-
cided to appropriate $585 for the
van, car and gas, the request to
the administration for the use of
the van and car was denied by
Dean of Student Affairs John
Dunlop, Brody said. Student
organization use of University
automobiles follows academic,
administrative and athletic
organizations in priority, Dunlop
said.

In addition to the above deci-
sions, eight other organizations
received funds from the commit-
tee.

The Bucknell Bandfront re-
ceived 75 percent of the $176 of its
original request. $325 out of $582
was allotted to the Ski Conference
team. The Bucknell Progressive
Caucus was granted $1564 out of
$2663. The Society of Physics
Students received $100 which it
had requested.

Lorraine Wallace to speak amid controversy

WHICH WAY IS LEWISBURG?—This sign points toward Buck-
nell, but not to the one with the Georgian architecture at
every turn. About two miles west of Bicester in Oxford-
shire, Bucknell, England is famous for its principal church—
a stone building of Gothic design that was built during the
13th century.

Lorraine Perigord Wallace will be here Tuesday
for the second installment of the Class of ’53 Lec-
tureship — one week after the end of the controver-
sy surrounding her husband Mike Wallace’s at-
tempts to stop ‘60 Minutes” from doing a story on
Haiti.

Mrs, Wallace, who has lived for a number of years
in Haiti and who still has family and a small
business on the island, reportedly was upset after
her husband first ran a story on the nation’s
repressive government in 1972. It was her pressure
that apparently led the CBS News correspondent to
ask his colleague Morley Safer not to film an update
of the story this year, according to the Associated

Press and syndicated columnist Jack Anderson.

Safer agreed to drop his idea of a new story after
Mr. Wallace explained his wife’s concern, but the
public disclosure of the whole affair last week
prompted ‘60 Minutes” Executive Producer Don
Hewitt Tuesday to order that the story be finished.

Organizers of the lectureship here had feared
Mrs. Wallace might cancel her appearance because
of the incident, but Sarah Salant ’81 confirmed
Thursday night that all three guests would par-
ticipate in ‘Meet the Spouse’’ at 8:30 p.m. Tuesday
in the University Center Forum.

NBC executive Diane Helaey and Mobil executive
Peter Healey are the other slated panelists.

BU Affirmative Action report is favorable

However. Becker is disappointed by no female qualifications for tenure

By TRICIA KENNEDY

The University’s Equal Employment Op-
portunity Committee reviewed and evaluated
the appointments of 19 women and 24 men to
the University’s professional staff during the
1979-80 academic year, according to a report
issued Friday by Assistant to the Provost and
Affirmative Action Officer Judith Becker.

The report said 16 non-instructional posi-
tions were filled by seven women and nine
men. There were 27 people hired in instruc-
tional positions, 12 of them women and one a
member of a minority group, the report said.

Of the 27 positions, four were provisional or

“tenure-track.’’ Men were appointed to these
positions in the departments of management,
economics and mechanical engineering.

Women occupy 22 of the 180 tenure-track
positions at the University and members of
minority groups occupy seven. According to
the report, 10 of the 21 temporary positions
are held by women.

Becker said she was “‘pleased”’ with the in-
crease in the number of women hired this
year but was “‘disappointed”’ that there were
no female applicants qualified for the
available tenure-track positions.

A LIBERTARIAN VOICE—Dennis Auerbach, director of chapter services of the organization
Students for a Libertarian Society, addressed a group of 15 students and faculty Tuesday
night in the Olin Science Auditorium. Auerbach, who spent two days on campus, spoke

The function of the Equal Employment Op-
portunity Commission, according to Vice
President for Administration and Finance
John Zeller, is “‘to keep University offices
aware of the need to hire minorities’ and to
make certain that ‘‘there is no discrimination
in the hiring process.”

Minority groups are legally defined as those
persons who are of black, American Indian or
Spanish origin, Zeller said. Vietnam
veterans, the handicapped and women are
also traditionally given special consideration
ea opportunity employers, according to

Recent incidents of theft and vandalism
at the Ellen Clarke Bertrand Library have
prompted library administrators to
tighten security measures there.

According to University Librarian
George Jenks, theft and damage to books
has always been a problem, but instances
of vandalism — including damage to
microfiche, books and the building itself —
increased sharply last semester.

Jenks said two wooden boxes valued at
$15 each and containing microfiche were
stolen from the library. The first box was
taken during the weekend of Feb. 20-22 and
the second was taken last weekend.

Apparently, the thief is more interested
in the wooden box than the microfiche,

Jenks said. A student found and returned

Library’s security tightened after recent vandalism

part of the film contained by the first
stolen box and Jenks found other bits of
damaged microfiche behind Roberts Hall.
However, the boxes are still missing and
the microfiche from the second stolen box
has not been recovered.

The replacement cost of the missing
microfiche is estimated at $300, according
to Jenks.

Jenks is ‘‘debating whether or not to use
uglier boxes” in order to deter future
thefts. In the meantime, library door-
checkers have been asked to be more
careful and thorough in searching
students’ belongings as they leave the
library.

Jenks declined to speculate as to who the
thief might be, but said, “J hope it’s not

Bucknell students and an outside source
instead.”

Vandalism to the exterior of the building
has also increased this year, according to
Jenks. A front window was broken last
weekend, and three others have been
broken this school year. Jenks said there
was “a lot of student activity around the
area,” which has prompted library ad-
ministrators to believe a fraternity may be
involved. These suspicions are unconfirm-
ed.

Jenks said, “Pages are being torn out of
books and periodicals and this only hinders
other students because replacement of
these materials takes a good amount of
time and money.”

Theft of books and other library
materials has influenced library ad-

Friday, March 6, 1981

ministrators to consider ‘installing a
magnetic security device system, he said.

According to Vice President for Ad-
ministration and Finance John Zeller, a
magnetic device would be installed in the
spine of each book. If the book is not pro-
perly checked out and demagnetized, an
alarm will alert librarian workers.

Although a consultant has been called in
to explore the cost and time involved in
utilizing such a system, no definite plans
have been made.

“The problem in incorporating this
system is the time and cost it will take to
put a magnetic device in each book. In the
long run, this system would cost less than
paying door-checkers to do the job, but the
final decision lies with library ad-
ministrators,” Zeller said.

Carleton University faculty members

visit to discuss exchange program

Richer (right) talk with Bucknell’s Assistant Professor of
Sociology Kim Scheppele at a reception for visiting Carleton
faculty in the C. Williard Smith Library Monday. A faculty ex-
change program with these three as participants is now being
planned.

By LISA CERUTI

Faculty members of Carleton
University in Ottawa, Canada
visited Bucknell this week to con-
tinue a series of meetings intend-
ed to organize a faculty exchange
program between Carleton and
this University.

“As the teaching program
becomes more stable, an increas-
ing number of colleges are turn-
ing to faculty exchange as a way
of trading jobs and finding new
challenges,’ according to
Associate Professor of English
Philip Withim.

The exchange of faculty
members is ‘‘tentatively”’
planned to begin in the 1982-83
academic year. Several Universi-
ty professors will travel to Ot-
tawa this year to give lectures
and meet Carleton’s faculty and
students.

Robert Blockley, an assistant
dean of arts and member of the
classics department at Carleton,

said the program is intended to
promote ‘‘voluntary faculty ex-
changes at the individual and
departmental level.”

“At the moment, we’re most
concerned with coordinating the
exchange of faculty. In the long
run, however, we would like to in-
clude students. Since Bucknell is
relatively more expensive than
Carleton, it might be difficult to
encourage Canadian students to
come,” Blockley said.

According to Assistant Pro-
fessor of Sociology Kim Schep-
pele, the exchange with Carleton
was originally intended to further
the University’s Canadian
studies program, but the faculty
members ‘“‘most excited” about it
were not those involved with
Canadian or American studies.

“Carleton is not as interested in
American studies as we are in
Canadian. Since Canada is so
dominated by the U.S., Cana-
dians are turned off by American

QELS DE DED

history,” Scheppele said.

Associate Professor of Religion
and Coordinator of Graduate
Studies William Becker said he is
“anticipating spending a few
days at Carleton’”’ and ‘“‘hopes to
teach a semester course there the
year after next.” :

Blockley said the faculty ex-
change will be ‘‘informal”’ since
there are no specific guidelines
as to which departments will par-
ticipate and how many professors
will be involved. ‘Since our
schools have different strengths
and weaknesses, we would not
necessarily want to exchange
people in the same depart-
ments,” he said.

In addition to Blockley,
Carleton faculty members Steven
Richer of the sociology depart-
ment, Alistair Tillson of the
English department and Donald
Smith, chairman of the French
department participated in the
three-day visit.

The University’s new Honeywell DPS-C3 was delivered to
the Computer Center Saturday, and is shown here in its
protective wrappings, waiting for assembly. The new ma-
chine is scheduled to be ready for staff use by April 1.

New computer system arrives:
will be ready for use in April

By M.E. WEIL
The Computer Center’s new computer, a Honeywell DPS-C3, ar-
rived in its entirety Saturday and will be assembled and ready for
staff use by April 1, according to Computer Center Director Jim
Eschinger.

Eschinger said the primary advantage to the new machine is its
speed. The Honeywell DPS-C3 allows 120 users to work
simultaneously, which is twice as many as the present Xerox
Sigma 7. The new computer will increase storage capacity by 50
percent, add a language called PLi, and enable users to run
“Jarger programs.”

Administrative offices will transfer their programs to the
Honeywell DPS-C3 during a twelve month transition period, and all
useful programs will be converted and used in the computer,
Eschinger said.

He said the University’s Computer Center will be joining Educom
Network (EDUNET), “a national consortium of educational com-
puter centers which will make large and unique programs
available.”’

The largest gift for the computer and the building to house it came
from Fairchild Foundation, which supplied a $1 million grant for
the new computer, and from the Pew Memorial Trust, which
donated $250,000.

“This new computer is the best one for the majority of people who
will be using it,”’ he said.

The Honeywell DPS-C3 will be available for use by students in
August.

The University is planning to sell the Xerox Sigma — purchased
the summer of 1969 — next spring.

ABS investigates financial aid

By JANET WILLIAMS

The University’s financial aid and admissions
program was debated at the Association of Bucknell
Students meeting on Monday night.

The congress, which is currently reviewing possi-
ble requirements for recipients of the ABS scholar-
ship, addressed questions to Director of Admissions
Richard Skelton and Director of Financial Aid
Ronald Laszewski. Although the question of the ABS
scholarship was not answered, the congress heard
many details of the admissions and financial aid
programs.

Laszewski said that due to a lower budget, the
University’s financial aid program is weaker than
that of comparable institutions such as Lehigh
University, Colgate University and Lafayette Col-
lege. Financial aid recipients represent 26 percent
of Bucknell students compared with 78 to 80 percent
of students who receive aid at the above schools, he
said.

Laszewski said that in order to offset the amount
of financial aid needed, all aid recipients—with the
exception of some athletes—are required to par-
ticipate in th dy program. Laszewski also

said that in 1980 13 football players were awarded
full grants while no non-athletes have ever received
a full scholarship.

Further, 29 percent of the financial aid for the
Class of ’85 has been earmarked for athletes,
Laszewski said.

Explaining why 71 percent of athletic aid was
awarded to males, Laszewski said there are more
males than females in intercollegiate sports.
However, Laszewski said he would rather spread
out the money available for financial aid to help
more people.

Following the discussion of the University’s ad-
mission and financial aid policies, the congress
directed its attention to the recent controversy con-
cerning the ABS minutes.

In response to the “fictitious” minutes, ABS
President Michael Suarez ’82 said that they were a
“good idea.” He added that the official document
can be found in the ABS office. The “Serious Digest
of Minutes” will be distributed monthly to RAs and
dorm councils. “What the ABS does is more impor-
tant than its minutes,” S id.

WORLD

Ocean treaty to be

opposed by Reagan

The Reagan Administration an-
nounced at the United Nations
Law of the Seas Conference Tues-
day it would not go along with ef-
forts to finalize a treaty that
would control the use of the seas
and their riches.

The conference, which began in
1974, opens its 10th session Mon-
day. It had been expected to end
six weeks later with a finalized
treaty to be signed next fall by
virtually every nation in the
world.

The Administration’s decision
to halt conclusion of the agree-
ment in the upcoming session
was due to a number of reasons,
according to the state depart-
ment. Included in these reasons
are the intense pressure from
private mining interests and a
plank in the Republican Party’s
platform critical of the Law of the
Seas Conference.

US embassy backs

Duarte in Salvador

No “preparations” had been
made as of Wednesday for
negotiations with the leaders of
the leftist guerillas in El
Salvador, according to
Salvadorian President Jose Nap-
poleon Duarte.

At the same time, the United
States Embassy put forth a com-
ment opposing any attempt at a
coup. The statement came after
the embassy was the target of
shots fired from a passing truck.

Secretary of State Alexander
Haig said as a sign of support for
Duarte, that a right wing coup
would have serious consequences
for continued U.S. aid to El
Salvador and that a call for
Duarte’s ouster ‘does not repre-
sent United States policy in any
way.”

Defense discussed
by Polish, Soviets

Senior Polish and Soviet of-
ficials agreed on the need for

“urgent” action to counter the re-
cent threat to ‘socialist Poland”
at an unexpected meeting in
Moscow Wednesday, according
to the Polish press agency.

The two sides agreed that the
defense of Communism in one
country was a matter for the ‘‘en-
tire socialist community,” the
report said.

NATIONAL

Defense spending

increase proposed

Secretary of Defense Casper
Weinberger, in an appearance
before Congress, proposed a
large increase in the Military
budget Wednesday that he said
would “significantly and quickly
strengthen our ability to respond
to the Soviet threat at all levels of
conflict and in all areas of the
world vital to our national in-
terest.”

Introducing what he termed
“the second half of the Ad-
ministration’s program to
revitalize America,” Weinberger
also explained a long-range plan
that would allow military outlays
much higher than anything con-
templated before in peacetime.

Under the Reagan Administra-
tion’s new plan, the outlay of
funds this fiscal year would rise
by$1 billion over the $157.6 billion
proposed by the Carter Ad-
ministration.

Grant awarded for
humanities project

ABS President Michael Suarez
has been awarded a $2,496 grant
from the National Endowment
for the Humanities to research
the problematic relation between
“Rational Scientific Thought and
Human Emotion, as seen in
Twentieth Century Utopian
Literature.”

The grant extends over a six-
month period, starting June 1,
Suarez said. He said he will
research the 200-page manu-

script in lieu of a summer job.

Suarez plans to convert some of
the chapters of the manuscript in-
to journal articles for academic
magazines. This would hopefully
help him find a publisher for the
final manuscript. As the grant
stands, Suarez is responsible to
reproduce his final work and send
it to special literature collections
at certain universities.

Following the completion of the
project, Suarez hopes to speak to
English and sociology classes
here, as well as to give lectures
on the subject.

Union County could
survive tax cuts

Union County could survive ifa
10 percent across-the-board cut
was put through on all programs,
according to W. Sherman Doeb-
ler, chairman of the county com-
missioners.

The conclusion came following
a meeting in Harrisburg Friday
of 35 Central Pennsylvania coun-
ty commissioners with Senator
Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania.

To live with the reductions,
every program would have to
“pare the fat,” but the general
feeling was that such a reduction
would be manageable, Doebler
said.

“Some of the commissioners
were not so happy about the tax
cut,” Doebler added. ‘They
thought the budget should be
balanced first. But others said
the cuts should be made.”

Artful credits

The recent move of the University Committee on Instruction in
support of awarding credit to students who participate in certain
performing arts groups must be applauded. The thought of bringing
academics and extra-curricular activities together in concert
represents the true heart of a liberal arts education.

Although the granting of credit to special studies in the arts is
progressive, if not belated, such a program must not be
limited to the arts; it should encompass all activities which add to
the well-rounded development of the individual.

While time, energy, thought and caring are necessarily a fun-
damental part of an individual’s motivations for participating in the
arts, so too are those which lead one to a special involvement in
other activities such as student government, the campus news
media and student social programs.

A carefully orchestrated involvement in many of these activities
provides a tangible complement to academic studies and can
enhance the knowledge and expertise of an individual in a field of in-
terest. To support and promote this vehicle of education is not a con-
cession but an obligation of an academic institution.

We support the committee’s relatively farsighted proposal with
the hope that it will not be limited to those individuals interested in
the arts. An earnest—even if not ‘‘pre-professional’’—interest in a
host of other activities should be recognized for more than just
abstract “‘credit.’”’ We hope the faculty does just this at their April
meeting.

Reporters, reported

Two news stories—one on the front page, the other on the
fourth—give us pause for reflection for the combined message they
convey.

The one, on the newly-granted permission for our photographers
to record forever the debates of the faculty on matters both weighty
and trivial, is heartwarming to us would-be journalists. That the pro-
fessors sided with Mills Edgerton’s argument that there really isn’t
a valid argument against suppressing freedom of the press here is a
good sign; private institution or not, the need for such an informal
Sunshine Law had too long been overlooked.

The other, on the interpersonal relationship between ‘‘60
Minutes” and the Haitian regime, is disheartening. That one of the
most admired journalists in the country is caught in a trap between
his family and his career as a public servant is a bad sign; when the
catalyst of the whole affair is here Tuesday, we hope she can shed as
much light on all of us as our professors did Monday.

Remember: The oftimes apparent whims of the reporter often
only reflect the whims of the reported.

Fiddling around

Bucknell is often criticized by strangers and knowledgeable
observers alike for failing to provide sufficient cultural outlets and
social alternatives to its students. The homogeniety of its Georgian
architecture sometimes seems to sink into its residents’ imagina-
tions as well.

Yet the University is fortunate enough to have an active alumni
arts association, one that is willing to provide the campus with a
well-stocked week of artistic programs and events. The fifth an-
niversary of the Celebration of the Arts Week is a good time to reex-
amine the goals of a college education and, most importantly, the
personality of the average student here.

MaryAnn LaCroix—student coordinator of the week—held an in-
terest meeting for organizing Celebration ’81 and was greeted with
an empty room. Many Celebrations of the past have suffered a
similar fate. Big names such as Rampal or Houseman may draw
well, but generally speaking the University’s arts weeks have been
as poorly attended as they have been well organized.

Amidst this inexplicable lack of interest in the arts come ever
more vociferous complaints of ennui with the fraternity party social
scene and the rural Lewisburg atmosphere.

Why have we come to college in the first place? Presumably, to
receive an education, a broadening of horizons—and those of us who
ignore an entire week of cultural programs, regardless of being
otherwise engaged at either the library or the bar, cannot be
classified as students.

osha thls ar a eee
Bucknellian is horse | BS publications jest for laughs

of a different color

To the Editor:

The Bucknellian has been criticized lately as be-
ing recalcitrant in performing its duties as an organ
of information. One person even went so far as to
say that ‘the Bucknellian is as exciting as a morti-
cian’s speech.” This is unjust and not true. The
Bucknellian is at least as exciting as the mortician’s
client, and last week’s issue proves it.

First, the editorial entitled “BS Minutes’? was
most enlightening. As an ABS member, I’d per-
sonally like to admonish Lon for trying to be
original. Lon, don’t you understand the importance
of those ABS minutes? The Bucknellian’s investiga-
tion of Dean Dunlop’s supposed kickback uncovered
the gross lie you were perpetrating and saved
Dunlop from further embarassment. The future of
Bucknell rests on your shoulders Lon; don’t let us
down.

The picture on the front page—of the swimmer
receiving a haircut—provided a fine example of the
hard preparation the swimmers had undergone in
anticipation of the upcoming ECC meet. I felt that
perhaps a photo of a track team member clipping
his toenails in preparation for his ECC meet would
have also been appropriate.

Other articles, such as the “Doonesbury” comic

plucked from the middle of the weekly series,

Prince Charles’ plans to be married to Lady Diana
and the murder conviction of Jean Harris might
lead some uncultured students to exclaim ‘‘Who
cares?” Well, I for one care, and I’m glad the
Bucknellian is responsible enough to provide the in-
formation.

The Bucknellian speaks with the voice of
Mickey Mouse? Nonsense. Mister Ed perhaps.

Mark Barbour ’82
March 4, 1981

To the Editor:

We find it humorous that all the
Bucknellian reporters can ascer-
tain to put on the front page of its
paper are stories about some-
one’s wit in the ABS minutes. If
the ABS is so uncredible for these
jokes, the Bucknellian should
recall some of its own stories.

For instance, last year the
Bucknellian reported that
McDonald’s was opening up on
the Third Floor of the University
Center. The front page photo-
graph was hardly credible to
McDonalds, and hardly true. And
what about the ad concerning
Angelo’s House of Leather? Nak-
ed breasts may have been hor-
ribly offensive to some people
(including the House of Pizza).

And did you know that 1800 people
accepted admission offers last
year? The Bucknellain reported
all of this. Now we students all
knew that the issue was in jest,
and we took it as such—even
though the Bucknellian could be
held liable for its juvenilish
reports.

Likewise, the ABS understands
Secretary Castle’s motives, and
subsequently, the ABS ap-
preciates it. Castle’s humor is
witty, directed toward people
with similar senses of humor, and
effective. The Bucknellian should
have such humor.

[Finds symptom, offers no cure

Craig Ullman’s definition of the role of a school newspaper (Feb.
27) is an accurate one, and one inherent in the act of publishing a
newspaper. As a former Bucknellian editor, I take exception to his
pronouncement that the Bucknellian fails in its endeavor to be
Bucknell’s student newspaper. I think it reflects the student body

Was Chambers featured in Class of 53 lecture:

To the Editor:

We were confused. There is no
doubt about it. We went to hear
Frank Stanton and Richard
Salant speak about corporate
responsiblity and ethics, topics
they are eminently qualified to
speak about.

To our surprise, we heard a 15
minute lecture by Dean
Chambers, who also must have
been confused in thinking that he
was to be the featured speaker. A
visitor who entered late asked us
if he was Stanton or Salant.

Following his dissertation, we

heard a brief discussion of career
paths, with such enviable advice
as “you have to be lucky” (what
course number is that?) or share
an office with someone who spells
his name Scaravelli.

There is no denying that there
were some amusing stories told
by intelligent men whose careers
have taken them to the top of the
television world. But the topic
they spoke on was neither serious
nor informative.

Finally, it is disheartening to
find that visitors to our school
seem to think that the only thing

on the minds of students is get-
ting a job. Perhaps they read the
Yale review. It said: ‘‘Bucknell is
a school for nice kids from nice
families who will do almost
anything to land a job witha good
company and precious little to do
anything else of value.”

The idea of the Class of ’53 Lec-
tureship is a valuable one. Let’s
hope the speakers take it serious-
ly.

THE BUCKNELL

DILEMMA

By Steve Diorio

sions in the Bucknell community as reported by the Bucknellian,
and therefore, the paper ‘“‘stifles its readership,” is ‘‘complacent”’
and “limits our freedom of speech.” Among those people whom he
claims despise Bucknell, who has made a serious effort to get his or
her frustration printed in the form of a letter, an opinions piece, or
an article, and had it “‘stifled’’? And does he define a news story on
a $1,106 tuition increase as trivial? Successive tuition increases
may have deadened the paper’s readers—not the Bucknellian’s
reporting of such increases.

I think Ullman has misdirected his complaint by addressing a
symptom—not the disease—and that he has done so without offer-
ing a cure. I suggest he join the ranks of Phil Andrews and Todd
Buchholz, who argue elsewhere in this paper for changes and
against complacency, and the many others who, when angered by
something here at Bucknell or by national and international af-
fairs, take up a pen and write about it, or hold a discussion that can
be covered by the Bucknellian. Ullman must remember that he too
is a member of the student body that the Bucknellian reflects.

To the Editor:

The brothers of Sigma Chi fraternity
would like to sincerely thank all those who
donated money this past Saturday night in
support of the Lewisburg Matbackers
Association, a midget wrestling league
which is presently being funded by Sigma
Chi. This money is being used to purchase
equipment for these young wrestlers, aged
seven through fourteen.

This sponsorship will become our annual
community service project in an attempt
to become further involved with the
Lewisburg community.

In addition to this funding, our involve
ment entails personal instruction, organiz-
ing practices and scrimmages, as well as
transporting these participants to various
area tournaments. Bob Beran, chairman
of the Sigma Chi Service Committee, is
working diligently to see that this project
will be a huge success. Assisting Bob will
be head coach Bob Attanasio and coaches
Barry Muhler, Mark Baker, Jeff Beane,
Brandt Nako, Greg DiGuilio, Jim Gravalis
and Tony Durkin.

The staff and the rest of us at Sig again
thank you for your support.

Students support athletes with more than cheers

By Todd G. Buchholz

Professional sports at
Bucknell? Well, sort of. In
justices at Bucknell? Yes.

A collision of inflation, higher
college ‘costs, more intense
athletic competition and finan-
cial aid monies are used to sup-
port interscholastic athletics. It
is a very tangled tale of mis-
placed priorities.

First a few facts about
Bucknell’s financial aid pro-
gram. Compared to “frame of
reference” schools such as
Lehigh and Lafayette, it’s poor.
Until a few years ago financial
aid at Bucknell was a part-time
concern. Because of this laxity in
a time of budget cutbacks, to-
day’s director—Ron Laszewski—
must be exceptionally aggressive
in attracting funds just to stay
even. Where similar schools give
2id to 70-80 percent of

students who qualify, Bucknell
can only afford to help about 50
percent.

Despite the dearth, we ap-
parently feel wealthy enough to
set funds aside in a ‘“‘talent
grant” pool specifically for
athletes.

It works like this. Before
Bucknell will give a dime for aid,
students must provide the first
$1,500 each year. Through sum-
mer jobs or January work or bor-
rowing from Grandma this ‘‘self-
help” must be contributed, ex-
cept for talent grant students.
And here’s where the sportsmen
turn pro.

Nearly 100 men and woman
athletes are not paying any ‘‘self-
help.” While regular financial aid
recipients might be working in
the game room or in the
cafeteria, these talented in-
dividuals are earning their $1,500
on the football field or on the
baseball diamond, thus draining

the financial aid budget of about
$150,000.

Perhaps ABS Congressman
Dan Huck ’84 said it best: “I’m

dishwasher in my face, and I

meeting.

think—some guy is getting paid
to bounce a basketball.”

If this policy were changed,
Laszewski says he could offer aid
to about 150 more students.

With a cutback of federal loan
programs (about 50 percent of
Bucknellians have a_ student
loan), rising tuition costs and
therefore more financial aid
qualifiers, the budget must be

Naturally any revision
frightens coaches and offends
sporting aiumni. Many will claim
that without the give-aways we
won’t be able to compete with
current athletic adversaries.
These questions should be put to
them.

Does our sports program hinge
on 100 people split among men’s
and women’s sports? Are

athletes choosing Bucknell only
because of that $1,500 grant?

Should aiding a few athletes take
precedence over helping many
other students who qualify for
financial aid but receive none?

The current economic troubles
have harmed everyone. But as
Laszewski said, ‘The sports pro-
gram has not borne the brunt pro-
portionally.”

Quoting from the board policy:
“It is expected tbat the level of
support will enable the Universi-
ty to participate in all inter-
collegiate athletics within the
limits of available resources. ”’

While Lafayette may have
funds to help 70-80 percent of
needy students and also give
special attention to athletes, do-
ing both is not ‘‘within the limits
of available resources’ at
Bucknell.

We have a choice to make. And
so do the trustees in May.

A long and winding road to success

By Joan Caragher and Kris Forsythe

Ideally, a college education is designed to aid
in the development of a ‘‘whole”’ person. In other
words, the graduating student should, upon com-
pleting the requirements for a degree, be social-
ly acceptable, emotionally stable and mentally
prepared.

Supposedly, 756 ‘‘whole”’ people will be set free
into the ‘‘real’’ world May 31.

Three basic options are available to these new
members of the nine-to-five world. First, one can
plan to sponge off one’s parents until one adjusts
to societal pressures. Of course, Bucknellians
are much too ambitious to choose this course.
Therefore, we will not dwell on its specifics.

The second, more popular choice is a job.
We’re sure you’ve seen many interviewees
around campus recently: they’re the ones who
force themselves to rise at the ungodly hour of 6
a.m. to sign up for interviews. They are next
seen on the day of the big event, arrayed in pin-
striped suits, conservative ties and wing-tipped
shoes for males.

Females opt for very basic tweed suits and
Papagallo pumps. If impressions are favorable,
they are offered a second interview. If unsuc-
cessful, the prospective careerist starts yet
another sign-up session at 6 a.m.

The third option is continuing one’s education
either in medical, law or graduate school. The
first stage of the application process
begins with standardized tests — either MCAT,

LSAT, GREs or GMATs. Compared to these
tests, the SATs seem like an exercise in connect-
the-dots. If one has a sadistic streak, one can
stroll by Olin Science on a testing day to gawk at
the frazzle-brained zombies that stagger out
after the grueling ordeal.

The real fun begins with filling out applica-
tions. After spending countless hours and dollars
writing why one is more qualified to be a doctor
or lawyer than the other 5000 applicants, one
may be lucky enough to receive a Dear Applicant
form letter. This usually states that ‘while we
cannot accept you this year, we did enjoy a
sumptious seven-course feast, the cost of which
was defrayed by your application fee.”’

The best way to handle a rejection is to set it
ablaze. To avoid burning down University hous-
ing, take the rejection letter, envelope and
cancelled check to the sink. Artistically singe the
edges to create a scalloped effect. The charred
correspondence brightens up not only one’s wall,
but also one’s disposition.

If, by the grace of the gods, one is accepted into
an institution of higher learning or offered a job,
celebration is in order. Books can be tossed
aside, while the ecstatic graduate polishes Space
Invader skills at the bar. Only then are these col-
lege years “‘the best of our lives.”’

field, Conn., will attend medical school this fall

Acoustic music mesmerizes audience

By D.S. JONES

Further evidence to support the
position that bigger is not
necessarily better was provided
by David Bromberg and friends
Saturday night.

No doubt, those who enjoy pay-
ing $15 for a ticket to sit 3
kilometers from the stage and ab-
sorb two hours of cacophony
would have been duly disap-
pointed, but for the full house at
each of two shows in Coleman
Theater, the evening defied
superlatives.

It has been said in passing that
it is often nice — when attending
a concert — to hear what those on
stage are saying, strumming and
singing. This aspect of concert-
going can be an exceedingly dif-
ficult task when one is seated in
an acoustic trash can that some-
times doubles as a basketball
theater. It would be a challenge
to find an auditorium that could
provide more comfortable and in-
timate surroundings than Col-
eman for both performer and per-
formee.

An added bonus at the
Bromberg show was the fact that
members of the audience could
see and hear every thing that was
happening on the stage.

In order to have the rare calibre
of concert that was produced on
Saturday night, however, it is
somewhat helpful to have, in ad-
dition to adequate acoustics,
someone worth listening to.

umbia University drop-out
rambled on with stories and jokes
that emerged from guitar solos
and disappeared into fiddle licks.
Bromberg’s wit and improvisa-
tional skills pervaded an at-
mosphere which was always
loose enough to allow him to
climb over a couple of rows of
seats and shake hands with
someone in the audience.

The acoustic guitars and fiddles
of Bromberg and his friend Jeff
Weiser proved that one need not
be electric to be eclectic.
Whether playing bluegrass,
ballads or the blues — which ap-

peared in the form of “Living in

the Country,” ‘Dehlia”’ and

“Come to My Kitchen”

David Bromberg is an artist who

falls into this category.

Bromberg captured the feeling of
each number and shared it with
his audience. Whether using slide
or picks, Bromberg’s guitar play-
ing mesmerized as his hands
seemed to magically float over
the instrument.

And whether or not an acoustic
show in a quality theater with a
lively audience listening to a fine
musician makes for entertain-
ment that rivals that found in any
city is a question that probably
will not be subject of too much
debate. From the talented warm
up music of Rich Getz and Steve
Triesman to Bromberg’s closing
solo ‘“‘Mr. Bojangles,” a prece-
dent in size and style was set that
gets a call for an encore.

By LYNNE RUTHERFORD

Famous artists, faculty, undergraduates and area
residents alike will participate in the fifth annual
Celebration of the Arts Week, beginning Saturday
and continuing through March 15.

The celebration, sponsored by the Association for
the Arts, serves as that organization’s “link with
undergraduates,” according to Associate Professor
of English Ralph Rees, chairman of this year’s pro-
gram committee.

“We try to bring as much of the arts to the public
as possible — local residents as well as students,”
Rees said.

The association, comprised of 210 parents, alumni
and friends of the University, has called the
building of a performing arts center its primary
goal.

Rees, along with the other 14 members of the com-
mittee, began his search for talent last summer.
Trustees, faculty and friends who sit on the commit-
tee are divided among the art, music, English and
drama disciplines and try to reflect this division in
varying the guests that come to campus.

The committee received cooperation from both
the Performing Series, which scheduled flutist
Jean-Pierre Rampal during the celebration, and
Cap and Dagger, whose production of “Our Town”
will fall at the end the arts week.

ger is celebrating its 80th
party after the

Powers, they decided on John Houseman as a first
choice and secured his services in July.

The association’s goal — the building of an arts
center — will be illustrated by architect Michael J.
Pittas who will present a slide show and lecture on
the problems of building such a center.

“Contributions are growing. Hopefully, it won’t
be too many more years,” Rees said of the building.

Coordinating the undergraduate portion of the pro-
gram is MaryAnn LaCroix ’81, an interdepartmen-
tal and French major, who began in early February
to secure student performers.

“In the beginning, the schedule was strictly off-
campus people. I filled it in with on-campus acts,”
LaCroix said.

LaCroix — along with Sue Dettbarn 81, Cathy
Claude ’82 and Linda Wolff—either approch-
ed or were contacted by various‘on-campus groups.
They tried to distribute activities between different
arts mediums, but were not always successful.

“’m disappointed that there is not much dance,”
LaCroix said. The Dance Company will present a
concert later this semester, but lack of time
prevented them from performing this week.

Another area that proved disappointing was lack
of student input in scheduling the week.

“J announced a meeting for anyone interested in
helping plan the celebration but no one showed up.
It’s not surprising — typical apathy,” LaCroix said.

Both LaCroix and Rees hope, however, that this
apathy does not extend to attendance figures during
the week. A glance at the schedule the association
has devised should convince students that there is
something for everyone, including themselves, they

Stiglich graces Center Gallery with
disturbing works of glittery nature

By DAVID BLACKMAN

Perhaps one of the most
unusual exhibits to appear in the
Center Gallery in quite some
time is the work of New York
area artist Diane Stiglich,
presently on display through
March 26.

At her opening Tuesday night,
students’ comments ran to:
“wild,’’ “tremendous clash of
elements,” ‘‘wonderfully disturb-
ing,” and ‘“‘just incredible” in
describing her works.

Using various man-made ob-
jects, art prints and photographs,
Stiglich transforms these items
with substances such as cotton,
feathers, human hair, artificial
flowers, tinsel, many personal
belongings and primarily glitter

to achieve her stunning results.

“Tm not interested in real
things or permanency, but in im-
itating real life and evoking im-
ages of nature through man-
made things,” Stiglich said.

The artist achieves these objec-
tives by creating a keen sense of
negative space and three-
dimensionality with different col-
ors and tensions of glitter over
mass-produced items of all kinds.

Originally from Abington, Pen-
na. and now residing in Lake
Hiawatha, N.J., the artist spent
several months living in
Lewisburg and instructed here
for two months as a substitute for
Assistant Professor of Art Joan
Curran. Stiglich received her for-
mal education from Moore Col-
lege of Art in Philadelphia and

the University of Texas at Dallas.

During her stay in the area, the
artist was inspired by many
items found in the Mifflinburg
Thrift Shop. Several of these ob-
jects are now on display_in the
Ellen Clarke Bertrand Library.

According to Stiglich, many of
her works are autobiographical,
based on particular events and
people in her life. Among these is
a piece which includes three
enlarged photographs of her hus-
band as a child.

Presently teaching part-time
and devoting eight hours a day to
her work, Stiglich is also now
displaying her pieces at the
corporately-owned 500 Exposi-
tion Gallery in Dallas and in
Philadelphia.

A true classic coming to town

By LYNNE RUTHERFORD

An American film classic, “‘“Gone With the Wind,”
will open at the Campus Theater in Lewisburg
tonight with showtime at 7:30 p.m.

Generally considered the most popular movie of
all time, David O. Selznick’s Civil War epic has been
witnessed by more people than any other film in
history since premiering in Atlanta on Dec. 15, 1939.
A pioneer in many important ways, ‘‘Gone With the
Wind” was filmed in technicolor with the largest
budget ($3,900,000) of any movie up to that time.

Filming of the 3-hour, 40-minute adaptation of
Margaret Mitchell’s novel took 22 weeks and proved
arduous to its directors. The original choice, George
Cukor, was removed after the first few weeks, pur-
portedly at star Clark Gable’s request. He was
replaced by Victor Fleming, who shot the greater
part of the film before collapsing from exhaustion.
Sam Wood and Sidney Franklin directed the final
scenes together.

Fleming’s mastery, though prevalent throughout
the film—one of its nine Oscars was for
cinematography—is best illustrated in the ballroom
and burning of Atlanta scenes. The most celebrated
sequence of the film, the pull back shot that begins
with a close-up of heroine Scarlett O’Hara and
grows to reveal hundreds of dying soldiers at an
Atlanta railroad station, is a towering achievement.

Legend has it that designer William Cameron
Menzies (also an Oscar winner) ordered the entire
scene reshot because a horse’s tail was braided in-
correctly.

In casting, Producer David O. Selznick issued a
nationwide talent search for Scarlett, which caused
hundreds of unknown young actresses to flock to
California. Stars Joan Crawford, Bette Davis,
Claudette Colbert, Katharine Hepburn and Paulette
Goddard were all rumored close to the role before
Selznick finally settled on unknown Vivien Leigh.
Her British background caused an uproar, but she
became the first English actress to ever win an
Academy Award.

Likewise, Hattie MacDaniel became the first
black to receive an Oscar in winning Best Sup-
porting Actress of 1939 for her portrayal of Mammy,
the O’Hara’s faithful servant. ‘“‘Gone With the
Wind” broke the color barrier here. Although still
playing servants, black people were treated as ma-
jor and sympathetic characters for the first time.

As Rhett Butler, Gable established one of the
most popular screen characters ever and was pro-
totyped as a glamorous hero for much of the rest of
his career.

In supporting roles, Olivia deHaviland, as the
fragile and noble Melanie, and Leslie Howard, as
her weak-kneed husband Ashley, fit their parts to
perfection.

Put simply, ‘Gone With the Wind” remains one of
the best cast, best filmed pictures of all time,
despite the more than 40 years that have passed
since its debut. We all owe it to ourselves to spend a
few hours sampling Scarlett, Rhett and Tara, along
with a very large bucket of popcorn.

Rampal brings golden flute to Rooke C

Long sold-out performance will be highlight of Arts Week

By VIRGINIA CHURCH

For years, the fabled French flutist,
Jean-Pierre Rampal, has regularly visited
North America and brought his singular
musical excellence along with his Gallic
charm. At 8:15 p.m. Wednesday, he will
visit Rooke Chapel.

This music master, dubbed by the
Detroit News ‘‘Alexander of the Golden
Flute,” was born in Marseilles, France.
His father was first flutist with the
Marseilles Symphony and a professor at
the conservatory there. Although Rampal
was not encouraged to become a profes-
sional flutist, his father did give him
lessons from early childhood.

Rampal’s decision to make the flute his
life’s work came about under dramatic cir-
cumstances during World War II. He was
in his third year of medical school when he
was called for military service. Learning

that his unit was destined for Germany, he
abandoned them and headed for Paris.
Once in Paris, Rampal attended the Con-
servatoire Nationale de Musique and
graduated with first prize in flute five
months later. After the liberation of Paris,
he became first flutist with the Paris

Opera.

Rampal is able to shed a vibrant new
light on all music and is particularly adept
as a champion of the Baroque. On Wednes-
day he will show us this sensitivity through
a wealth of music. Response to his coming
has been overwhelming; tickets for the
performance were sold out in 2% hours,
with many students turned away from the
box office.

The flutist and his accompanist, harp-
sichordist and pianist John Steele Ritter,
will perform Sonata in D Major by J.C.F.

play Enesco’s Cantabile and Presto and

program should satisfy lovers of the Baro-
que and novice music enthusiasts alike
with its romantic qualities.

Acknowledged internationally as one of
the great flute virtuosos of history, Ram-
pal is also credited as having single-
handedly wrought a world-wide
renaissance in flute playing. He has
opened up new doors in familiar music and
revived long forgotten works along with
adapting for the flute much music written
for other instruments.

Ray Moss ‘83 scores on a slam-dunk during the Bisons 79-66

Hoopsters eliminated in

ECC playoffs by Rider

Turnovers prove costly in 68-50 loss to Broncs

By JEFF CROSS

LAWRENCEVILLE, N.J. — Lapel buttons
sported by Bucknell fans during the East Coast Con-
ference quarterfinal game against Rider here
Wednesday said, ‘Lasso the Broncos.” Un-
fortunately, the once-Breakin’ Bisons were hog tied
68-50, abrumptly ending their season at 12-16 while
the Broncs (14-13) advanced to the ECC semis
against American tonight.

The hoopsters advanced to the quarterfinals with
a convincing 79-66 triumph over West Chester Mon-
day but lost to Lafayette 68-60 Saturday in the
regular season final, both at Davis Gymnasium. A
win over the Leopards would have given Bucknell a
bye in Monday’s preliminary round of the con-
ference playoffs.

Prior to the tip off against Rider, Head Coach
Charlie Woollum said “taking care of the ball and
shooting well” were keys in beating the Broncs to
earna third straight trip to the Palestra for the ECC
tournament this weekend. Bucknell had already
beaten Rider 62-55 in overtime at home Feb. 4 and
65-61 Feb. 21 on the road.

When Rider’s Fred Lee stole senior Captain Al
Leslie’s inbounds pass for an uncontested layup in
the first half minute of play, the Bisons should have
known it was not their night.

Although Bucknell stayed even with the Broncs
for the first 12 minutes, Bucknell could manage only
a pair of two-pointers for the remainder of the slop-
pily - played first half to trail 34-21. In committing 14
turnovers, the Bisons were whistled down for
traveling and charging violations and watched as
passes lacking their usual zip were intercepted.

“We threw a few balls away early and that made
us not try some plays; it made us apprehensive,”
Woollum said. “It appeared we were physically and
mentally exhausted. When the tempo picked up we
were gone.”

A driving layup by Paul Adkins ’81 closed the gap
to 38-28 with 14:43 remaining, but the cagers could
get no closer. Eight more turnovers and seven

“Sharp” is what Bucknell’s wrestlers
should have been to capture the team
championship in Saturday’s East Coast
Conference meet, according to Coach Bob
Ferraro.

The Bisons travelled to Lafayette last
weekend on the heels of a sweep of three
straight tri-meets and locked with their
Easton hosts for second place in the
ECCs—one match behind conference
leader West Chester.

But a bit of bad luck and a sluggish team
performance kept Bucknell from pinning
its first ECC team title, as the Bisons were
bested by West Chester and defending
champion Hofstra.

“We just didn’t wrestle well as a team,”
Ferraro said. “If we can place third in the
conference with a sub-par performance, I
can’t be unhappy. But we weren’t as sharp
as we were at the previous two meets.”
The coach was referring to the last two
outings, when the grapplers trounced con-
ference rivals American, Delaware,
Lafayette and Rider.

Misfortune tarnished the meet as Steve
Greenly ’82—150 pound champion in 1979
and runnerup at 158 last year—was gypped
of a possible win in the final because of
what Ferraro called an “error in of-
ficiating.”’

Greenly tangled with Rider’s Dave Doll
in the 190-pound final. Doll was called
five times on violations—two cautions for

blocked shots hindered the comeback attempt.
Woollum noted, ‘‘I don’t think we were ready to
play. All of us (coaches and players) were to blame
for that.”
“J don’t think we wanted it enough as a team,”
Craigg Cody ’83 added.

Seldom-used seniors Joe Vullo, Ted Schoeck and
Howard Manly all saw action, joining regulars
Leslie, Adkins, Mike Page and Dave Shehadi in
their final game in the orange and blue. Woollum
said, “‘They’ve been a part of a great four years of
basketball at Bucknell. I have the utmost respect
for all of them. They’re all the kind of people I like
as friends and players.”

Leslie led the team with 11 points despite four of
15 shooting while Rider’s Derrick Miller penetrated
the Bucknell defense effectively, scoring a game-
high 16 points while Lee added 14.

Against West Chester, a slam dunk by Ray Moss
83 with 3:27 left in the game gave the Bisons their
biggest lead, 69-51, but the Golden Rams then
scored 11 of the next 13 points. The hosts survived
the score, however, to secure a big 79-66 playoff win.

Page scored a game-high 16 points while Leslie
(14 points), Moss (12) and Adkins (10) all scored in
double figures.

Before a sellout audience Saturday, the Bisons
met Lafayette with first place in the ECC West at
stake.

Leslie took charge for Bucknell early, scoring 10
of the team’s first 12 points. He tallied 20 for the first
half, but the Leopards clung to a 37-35 lead.

The Bisons stayed within two points for the first
seven minutes of the final half, then gave up seven
unanswered points to trail 54-45. Adkins closed the
gap to 62-58 with 3:22 left but the Leopards used

false starting and three for stalling, ac-
cording to Ferraro.

Under NCAA rules, Doll should have
been disqualified and the match forfeited
to Greenly after the fourth violation. But
Ferraro said the referee lost count, and
failed to disqualify Doll, who squeaked out
a 13-12 decision.

Ferraro lodged a protest with the ECC
Games Committee, which voted 2-1 to let
the match stand because the referee had
already signed the match card, Ferraro
said.

“It’s unfortunate that there was a
mistake,” the coach added. ‘‘Neither Dave
nor Steve would want to win a match that
way.” Greenly said that he was concen-
trating on the match and that he only
knows what he was told about the error.
“These things happen,” he said.

The bright spot in the meet was the
outstanding performance by freshman
Jim TenBrook who grappled his way to the
142-pound title. The 1980 New Jersey State
High School Champion dropped from his
usual 150-pound slot two weeks ago, where
he wrestled all but two contests this
season. ‘Jim is big for a 142-pounder, and
that was definitely an advantage,” Fer-
raro said.

Women cagers beat Lafayette;

Henry sets career records

By S. J. FURMAN

The Women’s Basketball team
capped its regular season Satur-
day by posting its first win ever
over Lafayette. Bucknell ex-
hibited an impressive rally in the
second half to upset the
Leopards, (12-5) 63-61. Coming
off a two-game winning streak,
defeating both Bloomsburg and
York, the team boosted its final
season record to 7-12.

Trailing 38-24 at halftime, the
team returned in the second half,
hammering away at a 14-point
deficit. Led by senior Jill Henry
and sophomore Denise Cohen, the
team battled back to a 48-48
deadlock. With less than 10
minutes to play, the defense

began to pressure coach Pat
Fisher’s Lafayette team.

At 7:03, Jody Travisano, a 5’5”
freshman, was successful in a
two-point attempt that put
Bucknell ahead for the first time.
The pressure defense let up
earlier, however, and by the
three minute mark the Bisons
found themselves trailing once
again, 58-54.

At 1:42, they were down 61-56,
though Cohen returned with two
quick baskets to cut the
Leopards’ lead to one. Travisano
then created the key play in the
match. Stealing the ball from the
Lafayette guards, the Bucknell
freshman took the ball the length
of the court for an unhampered

fifth in the pole-vault at 14’6” and Mike Ward ’82 was fourth in the shot-
put with a heave of more than 48 feet. Ted Lewis 83, also hampered by
injury, still managed a fifth in the high jump and a sixth in the triple

jump.

The meet did have its bright spots. Freshman Bill Reifsnyder con-
tinued to shine after a golden rookie season of cross country running.
Reifsnyder dashed to a second place time of 9: 10.6 in the two-mile.

The highlight of the day was the exciting 1000 yard run, where the
trio of Hulme, DeBraggio and Bigotto duplicated their earlier feat in
the mile, by seemingly coming out of nowhere on the final lap, running
wide, and surging past the competition.

Bigotto was credited with the win in 2:14.4, while DeBraggio was
right behind in 2:14.5, and Hulme followed in 2:14.54. “It was just one
of those magical things—you reach down to see what’s there and it was

there,” DeBraggio said.

Of the sub-par Bison showing, Debraggio said, ‘Temple had an ex-
cellent day, but had we done anywhere near what we were expected to

do, we would have won. That’s the most frustrating thing.”

one.

With less than 40 seconds to go,
Lafayette made a costly mistake
by fouling Meg Gianesello 84
and sending her to the line. Sink-
ing the first shot but missing the
second, the freshman guard
tallied the final score. As
Lafayette regained possession,
time ran out and the Bisons were
winners of the heated match, 63-
61.

Honored before the game,
Henry had completed her
Bucknell career with school scor-
ing records for both single game
(28 points) and season (265
points) as well as a record 53 free
throws.

Fellow co-captain Liz Rabenold

scoring record of 595 points set by
Bobbie Castens ’79.

Swimmers bow to LaSalle for 2d place

Late rally fails to

rescue the poolsters

By STEVEN MEDOFF

A second and third-day rally by the Men’s Swimming
team Friday and Saturday at the East Coast Conference
Championships brought them a second place finish after
having ‘“‘one of the poorest starts in the ECCs in recent
years,” according to Head Coach Dick Russell.

Host LaSalle came out strong in the preliminaries
Thursday and maintained first place throughout the com-
petition. Finishing with 495 points, they easily bested
Bucknell’s 334 points, while Temple finished a distant
third with 281.

Russell said ‘‘we were flat on Thursday” and as a
result, the Bisons qualified for the finals in only three of
the five events that day. “It was all over before it even
started,” according to Russell.

Bucknell ended the evening in fifth place after manag-
ing only 60 points in what the coach termed an ‘‘earth-
shattering day.’ “They blew us right out of the pool,”
Russell commented on LaSalle’s 98-point lead after the
first day of action.

The Bisons began to surge Friday with ‘‘no place to go
but up,” according to senior Captain Pat Mitchell.
Sophomores Dave Wakely and Mark Bongiorno began the
rally Friday by taking first and second in the consolation
round — equivalent to seventh and eighth overall — of the
400-yard individual medley with times of 4:15.1 and 4:16.6
seconds, respectively.

The Bisons dominated the 200-yard freestyle by plac-
ing Mitchell second (1:43.8), Tim Jenkins ’83 third (1:43.8)
and senior Marc Corl fifth (1:45.1).

Senior Scott Schulte led the charge in the 100-yard but-
terfly by placing fifth with a time of 53 seconds, while Tom
Kane ’83 and freshman Rich Callaghan finished seventh
and eighth.

Bongiorno, senior Chris Layton and Doug Haverland
84 came in sixth, ninth and tenth in the 100-yard
backstroke.

Senior Mark Gensheimer was the only Bucknell swim-
mer to advance into either the final or consolation round
of the 100-yard breaststroke. Gensheimer, seeded sixth
after the preliminaries, bettered his position with a time
of 1:00.4, attaining a fourth place finish.

Jenkins, who broke the University record with a 6:43.1
clocking. As Friday’s last event, the relay “eft us on an
up note for Saturday,’ according to Mitchell. This was,
however, Bucknell’s only win in the three-day event, con-
trasted by the nine events captured by LaSalle.

The Bisons entered into the final day of competition
141 points behind LaSalle, holding only a slight eight-point
margin over Lehigh. ‘‘We were determined to hold onto
second place,”’ Mitchell said.

Highlights of the day included the breaking of two
school records, the most interesting of which involved
shattering the record in three separate heats. Jenkins
took Wakely’s 200-yard butterfly record in the
preliminaries, but Wakely was not to be denied and beat
Jenkins’ time in the next heat. Wakely went on to set the
present record of 1:53.554 by placing second in the finals.
Jenkins finished a strong third (1:54.2), Kane eighth and
Callaghan twelfth in the event.

A new school record was also set by the 400-yard

freestyle relay unit of Schulte, Jenkins, Corl and Dan

Corl and Schulte teamed up for a three-four showing

The Bisons picked up additional points in the 1650
freestyle as Dave Gassert 83 and Mitchell turned in
fourth and sixth place showings.

Divers scoring for Bucknell in the three-meter com-
petition were Dave Hartstein 83, and Tim Critchfield ’83.
The two sophomores managed 8th and 12th place finishes,
respectively.

Bison swimmers Gensheimer, Reg Blaber ’84 and Jeff
Payne ’83 swept the consolations taking seventh through
ninth places in the 200-yard breaststroke. Haverland went
on to place third while Bongiorno took eighth place in the
200-backstroke with 1:58.978 and 1:59.912 times.

Mitchell, Corl and Wakely are the only three Bisons
representing the team this weekend in the Eastern

Poor performances and a surprise show-
ing by Temple proved the stumbling
blocks in the track team’s defense of the
East Coast Conference indoor title Satur-
day.

The Bisons entered the meet as co-
favorites with Delaware and St. Joseph’s,
but it was the Owls of Temple who led the
ECC pack with 102 points to gain the cham-
pionship. Bucknell limped to a disappoint-
ing third, being bested by St. Joe’s for sec-
ond by the slim margin of 89 to 85.75.

The Orange and Blue got off to an
auspicious start in the early going by
dominating the one- and three-mile runs,
and it looked as if they were headed
toward another romp. In the three-mile,
the entire pack remained bunched
together for the first fourteen laps until the
swift early pace (4:41 at the mile) began
taking its toll on most of the runners.

Sensing an opportunity to break the
field, Rick Sayre ’82 made his move, open-
ing a 30-yard lead at the two-mile mark,
and strode home to an easy victory in a
perfectly paced 14:01.9. ‘“We wanted to let
Delaware’s (John) Kelsh take the pace out
fast the first five or six laps and then move
in front together and run 70’s (for each 4%4-
mile) from there on in,” Sayre said.

Glenn Gibney ’83 and Jim O’Shea ’8l
added valuable fifth and sixth place points,
finishing in 14:22.7 and 14:28.9, respective-
ly.

In the mile the trio of Mike DeBraggio
81, Steve Bigotto ’82 and Mark Hulme 83
were apparently stuck in the middle of the
pack with only one lap remaining, when
Hulme suddenly stepped to the outside and
made a furious charge over the final 150
yards, passing several runners along the
way and cruising to a sparkling second
place time of 4:08.9. Bigotto (8rd) and
DeBraggio (4th) trailed Hulme in 4:11.4
and 4:11.6, and the Bisons demonstrated
their prowess in the distance events once
again.

But things went awry soon afterward.

Martin Carter ’83 sprinted to a 6.42 in the
60 yard dash semifinals—the fastest time
of the day—but crashed into the scorer’s
table after breaking the tape, and injured
his hamstring. Carter pulled up lame after
40 yards in the disappointing finals.

Additional problems occurred in the 2-
mile relay. Bucknell’s strong unit of Bigot-
to, Kaplan, DeBraggio and Hulme was tied
for the lead before losing the baton after
some jostling on the far side of the track.
The group skidded to a disappointing fifth
place.

Unfortunately, most of the other disap-
pointments could be attributed to nothing
other than sub-par performances and tac-
tical errors.

Additional problems surfaced in the six
field events, which produced only 10.75
points. Freshman Scott Schneider took

Resignation of Veep 1s requested

OE aan
Ferguson is the third to leave in four years

By MATT KARANIAN

Vice President for University
Relations John Ferguson has
been asked by the University to
resign his position after less than
a year on the job, according to
sources high in the administra-
tion.

Although University President
Dennis O’Brien at first hesitated
to comment on Ferguson’s status
when asked early this week, he
did say Ferguson’s respon-
sibilities had been shifted and
“sharply focused” on finding
funds for the school’s $3 million
computer facilities campaign.

Citing his policy of not discuss-

publicly, O’Brien refused to
publicly comment on the status of
Ferguson — the fourth ranking
administrator here.

Confirmation that Ferguson
had been asked to leave his post
came to the Bucknellian amid
continuing rumors within Marts
Hall about the firing and as part
of a report of a major restructur-
ing of responsibilities at all levels
of Bucknell’s fund raising efforts.
Both O’Brien and Ferguson were
reported to play a key role in this
“restructuring.”

O’Brien said Ferguson “‘is still
the vice president,” but he said
the resumption of his “broad

academic year “‘has yet to be
determined.”

O’Brien did say ‘‘a shift in em-
phasis” had occurred which had
placed him in a more involved
position in the development of-
fice. But he denied there were
plans for anyone to be “fired,”
saying in the same interview that
the history of developmental and
fund raising officials here was
one “of short turnovers.”

Three men have served as vice
president for University Rela-
tions at Bucknell in the last four
years.

The disclosure that Ferguson
would be leaving Bucknell comes

nouncement in November that he
and his 11-member staff would
begin coordinating the largest
capital fund raising campaign in
Bucknell history — a $30 to $50
million drive that is hoped to
bring major additions to the
University’s physical plant and
endowment.

The Office of University Rela-
tions had been recently granted
permission to both expand its
staff and increase the physical
size of its office space — in the
form of a move by the staff out of
Marts and into the former Cen-
tral Susquehanna Intermediate
Unit building — in order to pro-

Bucknell Progressive

By SUSAN MacDONALD

A new journal, concentrating on “economic, political and social
issues’ will be published by the Bucknell Progressive Caucus.

The publication, titled The Catechist will center on the Webster’s
New Collegiate Dictionary definition of ‘‘one who questions searching-
ly and fully” as its theme, according to BPC member and journal
editor Stu Gay ’82.

“Our goal is to create an attitude of questioning and educating
ourselves; not just listening to the status quo all of the time,” Gay
said. ‘We feel it is important to present other options and we hope we
can really get people going and stir up some self-awareness.”

‘Assistant Professor of Economics Eric Schutz has been closely in-
volved with the BPC and said there is a great need for this type of
paper. “This is the only collection of serious writings by students I
have seen here since The Medium of Exchange, produced by the
Economics and Political Science societies. The Catechist will be an ex-
tension of that,”’ Schutz said.

The Catechist will be published twice a semester, with the first issue
scheduled for either March 18 or 23. Gay said, ‘We are not trying to
compete with the Bucknellian, this is a progressive journal and not an
alternative newspaper.”

Reagan’s economic cuts
will reduce financial aid

By MELISSA BAIR

Although the University can survive
President Reagan’s proposed budget cuts
in educational and other aid programs, it
“will certainly feel the pinch,” according
to Director of Financial Aid Ronald
Laszewski.

Since the University has substantial sub-
sidies, it will not be affected by Reagan’s
economic budget cuts as much as many
other universities who rely more on
federal aid will be, Laszewski said.

The University has never depended
heavily on federal aid, preferring instead
to rely more on its endowment and private
funds, according to Vice President for Ad-
ministration and Finance John Zeller. The
endowments and private funds accounted
for $2.2 million which was awarded to 800
students on financial aid this year. The
University received $350,000 from the
federal government in Pell Grants and
other awards.

The median family income of students
who receive financial assistance is $25,000
and 48 percent have a brother or sister in
college. Families with an income of $25,000
will not qualify for loans if Reagan lowers

the maximum income level for receiving
federal aid, Laszewski said.

The University’s financial aid budget
cuts will primarily affect the incoming
freshmen. Laszewski said, “Any change in
the number of financial aid recipients
must occur in the freshman classes.” Hav-
ing already committed itself to helping
present students, to now deny them
assistance would be an unfavorable course
of action, he said.

According to Laszewski, the Office of
Financial Aid is more inclined to continue
its assistance to those students who have
done well here and who wish to stay, in-
stead of granting assistance to prospective
freshmen.

This year the University granted
assistance to 30 percent of the financial aid
applicants. “The tragedy is that there are
many people who are qualified to go to
Bucknell but we just don’t have enough
money to give them,” Laszewski said.

If Congress votes to eliminate the in-
terest subsidies now provided by the
government while a student is in college,
this would mean many students could no

BSA, ABS send 3 students to Atlanta

By BILL THUM

In order to ‘increase the awareness” of University
students to the murder and disappearance of 21 black
children in Atlanta, the Black Student Alliance and
Association of Bucknell Students have sent three BSU
members to a rally in Atlanta this weekend.

“The situation in Atlanta is critical, and although we
feel University students are informed and caring, we
would like to increase student’s sensitivity to the pro-
blem,”” BSU President Kevon Makell 82 said. In this
spirit, the BSA approached the ABS for funds to sponsor a
trip to the rally in Atlanta.

ABS Vice President Melissa Campbell ’82 said, “We
discussed the situation with the BSA members and
authorized a special appropriation of $150 to fund the

Appeal for humanity

trip.” Campbell added, ‘“‘We hope the rally and activities
which follow help aid the families of the children and city
of Atlanta to find strength in the face of this tragedy.”

The BSA plans to follow up the rally with a formal
presentation to the ABS. Green ribbons and arm bands —
which have already been worn by the men’s basketball
team and been distributed at universities across the coun-
try — will be provided for Bucknell students.

“The color green represents life and our interest in
preserving it,”’ Makell said.

In addition to the ribbons, the BSA will begin fund-

raising activities to aid the effected families, Makell said.
Although plans have not yet been finalized, the BSA hopes
“to generate enough support to make a substantial con-
tribution to the effort,” he said.

Of the 21 black children who have disappeared in the
past 19 months, 20 have been found murdered either by
suffocation or strangulation.

The massive police investigation mounted by the city of
Atlanta is costing approximately $250,000 a month, but as
of yet, no solid evidence has been uncovered.

Although the crimes involve only black children, ‘‘we
feel the awareness and concern for the deaths of any
children must be shared by all,” Makell said. ‘“‘At this
point the racial differences break down as we must join to
mourn for the tragedy.”

ABS redirects scholarships;

drops minorities for leaders

By JANET WILLIAMS
and BILL THUM

The Association of Bucknell Students
voted unanimously at its Tuesday meeting
to redirect the intent of the student
scholarship program from promoting the
ability of minorities to attend Bucknell
towards the support of students with need
who demonstrate leadership qualities.

The student scholarship program, which
since 1969 has been supported by a $5 por-
tion of the student activities fee, has been
under evaluation by the ABS for three
weeks. ABS President Michael Suarez ’82
said it was difficult to reach a decision
because of ‘incomplete information.”

“The late 60s saw an increasing student
awareness of the few minorities on cam-
pus along with a severe need for an in-
crease in the University’s financial aid
budget,” ABS Vice President Melissa
Campbell ’82 said. ‘With this as motiva-

a

meeting Tuesday night in Vedder Hall. The Congress voted to redirect schol-
arship funds from minority applicants to those with “leadership potential.”

its concern through the establishment of
its own financial aid fund using the student
activities fee as its base,” Campbell said.
However, after an investigation by an
ABS task force and interviews with ad-
ministration representatives, the ABS

determined that the ‘original political
gesture of the scholarship fund was lost”
and the emphasis on helping minority
students ‘“‘needed to be revised’’ Suarez
said.

“The needs of the University community
were evaluated and the dilemma of stu-
dent activities and need for dynamic
leaders was recognized,” Suarez said.

The new policy calls for a continued use
of $5 currently withheld from the student
activities fee to be given to the University
Office of Financial Aid. The monies will be
distributed as scholarship funds based on
requirements of proven need and demon-
stration of leadership potential at the
University.

The policy further stipulated that the
source, intent and purpose of the scholar-
ship aid be made known to all students who
receive funds. The policy concluded with a
call for review whenever the ABS petitions
the University Board of Trustees to adjust
the student activities fee.

Suarez said the student gift of $15,000 an-
nually is a fine program ‘“‘which will now
be directed at developing leadership
potential at the University.”

Wallace ducks topic
of CBS controversy

By NANCY KERVIN

Lorraine Perigord Wallace
refused to comment on her hus-
band Mike Wallace’s attempts to
prevent ‘60 Minutes” from doing
a news program on Haiti when
she participated in a Class of ’53
Lectureship panel discussion
Tuesday night in the University
Center Forum.

“I really don’t have anything
further to add. The story has been
done so often by the press. But
Mike did a very critical story-on
Haiti in 1972,” she said.

Although Mrs. Wallace, who
formerly lived in Haiti and still
has family and business interests
there, reportedly pressured her
husband to ask his colleague
Morley Safer not to film another
program on Haiti, ‘60 Minutes”
Executive Producer Don Hewitt
has since ordered that the story
be completed.

In addition to Mrs. Wallace,
NBC Vice President of Affiliate
Relations Diane Healey and her
husband, Peter Healey, .a senior
crude trader for Mobil Oil, were
questioned by a panel composed
of Bucknellian Editor David
Hawkings ’82, L’Agenda Editor
Jim Zimmerman ’81 and Liz
Hawley ’81 and Vernitia Shannon

81 of WVBU-FM.

Although the discussion was en-
titled ‘‘Meet the Spouse: Insight
to the Inside,’’ the guests
answered questions on a variety
of topics ranging from working
women and their families to the
Haiti controversy.

When asked about her reaction
to the controversy surrounding
Mary Cunningham’s resignation
from her position as vice presi-
dent of Bendix Corp., Mrs.
Healey said, “The incident was a
setback to me. She only made one
mistake and that was accepting
the position too quickly.”

The speakers also discussed
problems encountered by being
married to public figures. “It’s a
question of negotiation, just as it
is with me and my husband’s
travels and the disruptions that
have occurred,” Mrs. Wallace
said. ‘‘Now it doesn’t bother me
at all, and my husband has
become used to letting me do the
things I want to do, like going to
Fiji to visit my son,”’ she said.

“You have to recognize the fric-
tion” when a husband and wife
are advancing in their careers at
different rates, Mr. Healey said
at an “open classroom’’ session
Wednesday morning.

NBC Vice President of Affiliate Relations Diane Healey, Lorraine Perigord Wallace and Peter
Healey, a senior crude trader for Mobil Oil Corp., participate in a Class of '53 Lectureship panel
discussion Tuesday night in the University Center Forum. The three speakers were quizzed by
student panelists during the discussion entitled "Meet the Spouse: Insight to the Inside.”

“J personally think it’s a shame
that society hasn’t made provi-
sions for me to be a full-time
parent,” Mrs. Healey said in
reference to the shortage of day-
care facilities for children.

“I love kids as long as they’re
somebody else’s. But I absolutely
love my job and get my kicks
from there,” she said.

Other subjects discussed by the

panel included government fun-
ding of the arts and television
programming. According to Mr.
Healey, ‘‘The government should
support art to some degree but it
shouldn’t be the primary source
of funding.”

Mrs. Wallace said there are
some misconceptions surroun-
ding Americans’ viewing of

educational television programs.
“© 60 Minutes’ isn’t glamorous
— there is hard news reported,
yet the show is in the top ten
rating every week.

Tuesday night’s panel discus-
sion was attended by 175 people,
while about 35 went to the ques-
tion and answer session the next
day.

Caf uses a new system
to ease lunch congestion

By M.E. WEIL

Longer lines outside the
cafeteria may be the result of an
effort to reduce congestion in ser-
ving areas during lunches, ac-
cording to David Christiansen ’81
who is conducting a traffic flow
study of the cafeteria.

“The new system seems to be
working but it’s not very easy to
enforce,” Christiansen said. ‘“We
are trying to regulate the flow of
diners into the service area by
having the ticket punchers slow
down the line, but that seems to
be causing longer lines outside
the service area,” he said.

Christiansen’s study includes a
plan to reorganize the lunch lines,
regulate the flow of diners and to
encourage people to change their
eating schedules.

According to Dining Service
Director Hank Ross, ‘‘Controlling
the line is a good idea and the
plan has helped somewhat, but
we haven’t solved anything yet.”
Ross said the main problem is
that “there are more students
with meal plans than the caf is
designed for.”’

Christiansen’s study is ‘‘worth-
while because it could provide
maximum use of the cafeteria,”
according to Ross, but ‘‘it won’t
eliminate the problem.’’ There
must either be a change in the
scheduling of classes to avoid the
noon rush or provisions for more
seating some place else,”’ he said.

The new system includes a line
going through the center doors
for students with fast passes. Ac-

cording to Christiansen, the nor-
mal line is stopped or slowed
down when the service area
becomes congested, while the
fast pass line continues to move
at a slower pace.

Long lines outside the service
area will continue to be a pro-
blem as long as 70 percent of the
students use the uphill entrance
at peak times, according to Chris-
tiansen. He said notices will ap-
pear in What’s Happening next
week and posters will be put up
encouraging students to use the
downhill entrance at noontime.

“Before the University builds
an addition to the UC, a shift in
the academic class schedule is
needed to alleviate the caf’s
capacity problem. We’ve got to
try to use the facilities we have as
efficiently as possible,” Chris-
tiansen said.

Christiansen said he would like
to see more ‘‘concern for the
fellow students” who are waiting
outside the service area. “If
students moved more efficiently,
it would reduce the waiting time
for all and save frustration,” he
said.

Catherine Samra ’81, a
cafeteria meal ticket puncher,
said the new system is ‘“‘suc-
cessful but we need people to
cooperate. It is not that easy to
implement.”

The traffic flow study is part of
Christiansen’s_ senior civil
engineering project. Christiansen
said he will begin evaluating the
results of the study next week.

Model of campus undergoes revision

By CINDY CROSSLEY
The model of the University’s present and plann-
ed buildings and grounds is being revised to in-
clude recent changes in the University’s plans for
expansion.

The Bethlehem Model Company is making the
necessary revisions in the model, which is normal-
ly displayed in front of the Information Desk in the
University Center.

The change that prompted the model’s revision
is the addition of the completed computer center,
lames to Director of the Physical Plant John

ell.

Another change is the restructure of the propos-
ed life sciences building from a round bulding to a
group of six buildings, Bell said. The modified
design is intended to complement the architecture
of the computer center, according to Bell.

The model will also be modified to show a “‘rough

guess”’ of the design of the planned library addi-
tion. Other revisions include the addition of the
completed platform tennis courts, a color change
of the football stadium from white to gray to in-
dicate its completion, a change in the labels of the
fraternities to their initials, and the addition of
some walks.

Bell said he and Vice President for Administra-
tion and Finance John Zeller decided in mid-
January to bring the model up-to-date with the
completion of the computer center.

“Since the model only reflects current thinking,
anything we put there in white is suggestive and
not necessarily the final plan. It only shows our
potential plans as they appear to be at this time,”
Bell said.

The cost of revising the model will be between
$800 and $1200, according to Zeller.

The model is expected to be returned from
Bethlehem by mid-April.

Student volunteers
fire and ambulance teams

By SUSAN THUM

The fire protection and ambulance ser-
vices provided by the William Cameron
Engine Co. would not be as effective
without the volunteer aid partly provided
by University students, according to Am-
bulance Chief David Arndt.

The company, located at 11 Buffalo Road
in Lewisburg, depends entirely on
volunteers for support, Arndt said. Six
University students are now participating
in the program, but with two volunteers
graduating this year, “We need help,”’ he
said.

The service responds to more than 200
fire and accident calls each year and
responded to 1,207 ambulance calls last
year, student volunteer Andy Marsh ’81
said. ‘‘Largely due to the intensive train-
ing program and excellent quality of
equipment, the company has been ranked
as one of the top fire departments in Penn-
sylvania,” Marsh said.

Although there are no prerequisites for
the volunteers, Marsh said a certification
in Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation is
desirable. Training entails two to three
hours each week, working with the equip-

help

ment and sometimes with simulated fires,
Marsh said. “Altogether, the student
volunteers spend about six hours per week
guarding the 50-square mile territory the
company is responsible for,” he said.

Arndt said volunteering in this program
is an excellent way “‘to get to know the
area and people” outside of the University.
In addition to the direct experience of at-
tending ambulance and fire calls, the pro-
gram helps to develop relationships bet-
ween students and Lewisburg citizens, he
said.

In the 10 years that the students have
worked on the force, they’ve responded to
the emergencies which occur on campus in
addition to the University’s security force,
Acting Chief of Security Mike Amarante
said. “Both Marsh and Kevin Congdon ’81
received training from campus Security.
We've always found the Lewisburg
volunteers to be very prompt and ex-
perienced when needed,” Amarante said.

“They’ve arrived on the scene often
ahead of Lewisburg and East Buffalo
Township police,” Amarante said. “It’s
often good to have students dealing with
their fellows in emergency situations.”

Policy lacking on press ’s right to attend meetings

By LISA CERUTI

The exclusion of the
Bucknellian from a regular
meeting of a University standing
committee this week has promp-
ted the newspaper to discover
that Bucknell has no policy on ac-
cess of the press to the meetings
of the school’s governing bodies.

After telling a reporter from
the paper that the Committee on
Instruction’s meeting Tuesday
was “closed to the press,” chair-
man of the committee, Joseph
LaBarge, said he ‘‘is not aware of
any University regulation which
addresses this issue.’

According to Vice President for
Administration and Finance John
Zeller, ‘‘it’s the prerogative of the
chairman of each committee to
open or close the meetings.”

“There are times when the

committee discusses issues con-
cerning personalities and mat-
ters requiring confidentiality. It
is awkward and inconvenient to
keep saying things are ‘off-the-
record’ when a member of the
press is there,” LaBarge said.

The Committee on Instruction
had a “brief discussion’ at its
meeting concerning opening the
session to the press and ‘“‘there
was a division” of opinion, ac-
cording to LaBarge. He said “‘the
issue should be addressed by the
committee’’ but the decision was
postponed until a quorum of
members are present.

“Students supporting Bucknell
through tuition should have ac-
cess to information through their
media sources. However, we all
work in the same environment
and people fear that comments

may be misconstrued or offen-
sive to others,” committee
member and WVBU News Direc-
tor Todd Buchholz ’83 said.

Although the Instruction Com-
mittee was divided in its view
towards opening the meetings,
LaBarge said he would “strongly
resist” the implementation of a
policy declaring all meetings
open and restricting the commit-
tees’ options to close them.

“All University governing
bodies, from the board of trustees
to the Committee on Instruction,
should be open to the student
media,” said Bucknellian Editor
David Hawkings ’82.

Hawkings said students should
have access to the information
presented in the meetings, since
the committees are part of their
governmental structure.

University Provost Wendell
Smith said closed meetings were
not an issue until this year.

“Since no policy exists, we

have to go by tradition and prece-
dent. The issue was never eXx-
amined very closely,” Smith
said.

BPC plans a protest of
ROTC tactical exercise

By SUSAN MACDONALD and
ze BILL THUM

The Bucknell Progressive Caucus geared
up for an attack on the planned tactical
manuevers on campus by representatives
of the Reserve Officer Training Corps
(ROTC) at its general meeting in Hunt
Hall Thursday.

The meeting, which dealt with any of the
events planned by the caucus, ended in a
proposal for action to be taken against the
manuevers — which are presently
scheduled to occur March 21 in the field
behind Swartz Hall — BPC member Britt
Clayton ’81 said. Although definitive plans

The first issue will explore the topics of interna-

The Catechist will feature poetry, opinions, let-

According to Zeller, in choosing the University,
“a top notch school of higher learning,” parents and
students have committed themselves to paying
twice as much in tuition as they would have for a
public institution.

“One has to be concerned that the whole emphasis

Zeller said.

Architect lectures on problems of center

By David Hawkings

ee SS

Creating a physical home for the arts at an institution like
Bucknell is an extremely difficult task that should none the less be one
of the University’s top priorities, the design and planning director for
the National Endowment for the Arts said here Monday.

Although the technical, aesthetic and financial problems en-
countered in constructing buildings for the arts — especially the per-
forming arts — often seem insurmountable and contradictory, the
creation of such a center ‘would be highly rewarding for you,”
Michael Pittas told a group of students, arts faculty, local University
benefactors and top administration officials.

Speaking to a group of about 50 in the University Center Forum,
Pittas described the complex process of creating a space for universi-
ty and visiting performing artists that appeases and appeals to per-

Such a center should be a work of art in itself, he said, adding that
this is a much easier goal to accomplish if all parties concerned with
the building and the institution it is for are consulted thoroughly in the
planning stages.

Pittas’ visit to Bucknell and his discussion of designing arts
centers during this year’s Celebration of the Arts week coincides with
a renewed emphasis by the Association for the Arts on what it calls its
“chief aim” — that of bringing about the construction of just such a
center on campus.

Association for the Arts Secretary and Associate Professor of
English Ralph Rees said at the lecture that the desire to open a discus-
sion about the feasibility of such a center here also prompted the
association to realize that the primary artist who would be involved in
such a project — the architect — had been previously ignored during
the Celebration.

Pittas said, however, that this is not unusual for what he and other

architects have termed “‘the mother of the arts.”

Rampal’s brilliance stuns the crowds

The world’s foremost flutist is master of both the technical and Sige bas

By David O’Connell

More than 950 people crowded into Rooke
Chapel Wednesday to hear Jean-Pierre
Rampal, the world’s premier flutist, pre-
sent a stunning display of technical vir-
tuosity and musicianship.

In what is certain to be remembered as a
classic among Artist Series programs
here, Rampal gave the audience a study in
contrasts both in his programming choices
and in his renditions of those pieces.

Recognized universally as a master in-
terpreter of Baroque music, Rampal
devoted the first half of his program to
sonatas by J.S. Bach and two of his sons —
J.C.F. and C.P.E. Bach — followed by Cor-
elli’s Variations on La Folia. In contrast to
this, the artist proved himself equally
suited to more contemporary works by
Martinu, Enesco and Poulenc.

Opening with the J.C.F. Bach work,
Rampal and accompanist John Steele Rit-
ter immediately exhibited precise ensem-
ble in a movement which placed the harp-
sichord quite in the foreground. Indeed,
Ritter was stellar throughout the evening,
as harpsichord in the first half and later at
the piano.

Rampal’s Baroque allegros were con-
sistently light and airy, with almost ef-
fortless flow in the more difficult
passages. His slow movements presented
a carefree and timeless progression
through musical expressionism. One
might find fault with the tempo — adagios
taken as andantes to enhance the virtuosi-
ty of running passages, for example — but
the music never rushed past. It was par-
ticularly gratifying that the fast
movements were not taken at a hectic clip,
as Rampal has sometimes been known to
do.

Specifically, the lack of frantic urgency
so common in Baroque music was quite
pleasing in the C.P.E. Bach sonata. Writ-
ten for solo flute, the piece thus allowed
Rampal the freedom to express his

JOHN HOUSEMAN

musical ideas with no restraints and no
one pushing him.

Perhaps the best music made in the first
part of the program was in the final allegro
movement of the J.S. Bach sonata. Con-
trasting lyrical and punctuated passages,
Rampal showcased his ability to make
abrupt transitions in mood and dynamics
effortlessly.

The Corelli piece was a further chance to
exhibit contrasts. Beginning .with a bold
theme statement, Rampal ran through a
wide range of musical emotions, as each
16-measure variation seemed to be the op-
posite of its predecessor, yet at the same
time flowed naturally from it.

The second half of the program gave the
artist a chance to depart from some of the
Baroque predictabilities and reach for
even greater heights. At times the music
became secondary to its rendition; Ram-
pal’s phrasing was impressive beyond all
else.

The Adagio in the Martinu sonata was
one of the best slow movements of the
evening, as a mystical, perhaps even
haunting color was painted. This was
followed by a precisely quick Allegro —
where Rampal’s fast trills stole the
spotlight.

The first true presto occurred in the
Enesco. In this running, rolling move-
ment, a feeling of perpetual motion was
created. This was even surpassed in the
closing presto of the Poulenc; its final
furious bars brought the concert to an elec-
trifying close.

Rampal obliged the audience’s standing
ovations with three encores. The first was
a virtuostic presto by Carl Maria von
Weber, followed by the Sentimentale from
the popular Claude Bolling Suite for Flute
and Jazz Piano. A very suave rendition
brought the crowd to its feet once again.
Rampal sent the audience home after a
furiously fast technical display of a Chopin
work.

One is left with an overall impression of
combined excellence in both technique and

Chapel on Wednesday. The capacity crowd left astonished at the depth of
emotion in his playing. Here, he prepares for the concert in the office of

Rampal’s visit.

musicianship. This versatility — the abili-
ty to let technique speak for itself without
overshadowing the music — distinguishes
Rampal from most concert artists. One
could make the comparison to violinist
Eugene Fodor’s appearance here two
years ago. Fodor is remarkable in his
technical brilliance, but this is all he has to

offer. Rampal successfully adds that extra
touch of lyricism and phrasing.

It is most difficult to pinpoint why the
concert had such an electrifying effect and
musical impact. This is only superceded
by the difficulty of trying to cut through
one’s awe and find anything of substance
that can be objectively “criticized.”

\Houseman lectures on ‘Seven Theatres’ ;
has wealth of talent as an actor and writer

By Robin Meredith

Award-winning actor John Houseman will speak in
Rooke Chapel tonight at 7:30 on the topic of “My Seven
Theatres’ and will conduct a workshop on the University
Theatre at 10 a.m. Saturday.

Although most students recognize Houseman for his
role as Professor Kingsfield in ‘‘The Paper Chase — for
which he won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Ac-
tor — his involvement in theater and films long predates
World War II.

“There aren’t many men still alive that have had the
impact Houseman has had. He is an exceedingly impor-
tant man of the theater,” according to Harvey Powers,
director of the University Theatre.

Houseman’s first opportunity came in 1933 when, after
meeting the American composer Virgil Thompson, he pro-
duced and directed the Gertrude Stein-Virgil Thompson
opera Four Saints in Three Acts, acknowledged to be one
of the most inventive and exciting productions ever to ap-
pear on stage.

Houseman, together with Orson Welles, conceived and
produced a version of ‘“‘Macbeth’’ set in Haiti named
“Voodoo Macbeth” with conjurers and voodoo drums and
an entirely black cast. He also assisted Welles in panick-

ing America with the famous radio broadcast, ‘War of the
Worlds.”

His productions in film include “The Blue Dahlia,”
“They Live By Night,” “The Bad and the Beautiful,”
“Julius Caesar” (the Marlon Brando version), ‘‘The Un-
seen’ and “Executive Suite.”

He has appeared on television in ‘Six Characters in
Search of an Author,” “Bionic Woman,” “The Captains
and the Kings,” “Washington” and “‘Aspen.”’ “The Paper
Chase”’ series is being repeated on Public Television this
season.

*fouseman, who began his career late in life, has had
roles in the popular movies ‘Roller Ball,” “Three Days of
the Condor,” ‘‘The Cheap Detective,” “My Bodyguard,”
“Old Boy Friends,” and the film version of ‘The Paper
Chase,” extending his work to all mediums.

He has also been active in teaching theater and
established the drama department at the Juilliard School
in New York. He later formed ‘The Acting Company”
with the best of his students there and began touring
throughout the country.

Although it is not certain what Houseman is planning for
his Saturday morning workshop, ‘che may come to see
“Our Town” and talk about the theatre and actor training
in the context of the play,” Powers said.

Music revisited by
a talented couple

By Lynne Rutherford

Clifford and Georgette Reims — experts on Victorian era vocal
music — presented a multi-media program on their joint subject mat-
ter Thursday afternoon in the University Center Forum.

The Reims’ format included singing, slide shows and piano ac-
companiment by Associate Professor of Music Darina Tuhy. Reims, a
university alumnus, is the chairman of the vocal department at
Roosevelt University in Chicago. Both he and his wife are well known
throughout the Chicago area as soloists and as presenters of operatic
productions of various kinds.

Reims, a tenor, and his wife, a soprano, utilized their pleasant and
well-trained voices to vocalize the delicate, often poetic Victorian
pieces. Featured were the works of three eminent English composers:
Samuel Lover, John Hullah and William G. Cusins. Compositions were
usually of the writer’s lesser known works.

Lover (1797-1868) was a well-known painter and writer before loss of
his eyesight inspired him to embark on his career as a songwriter. He
produced a number of “Irish Evenings’’ — comic songs — as well as
hauntingly beautiful ballads. “‘The Fairy Boy”, ‘My Mother Dear,”
“True Love Can Ne’er Forget,” and “‘The Low Back’d Car’’ were the
pretty melodies sung by Mrs. Reims here.

Hullah (1812-1884) was an all-encompassing musician and composer
who exercised a profound influence on the music of the Victorians.
Highlighting the Hullah works was a libretto to his comic opera ‘‘The
Village Coquette” (1836) written by Charles Dickens. This obscure
work narrowly escaped a fire at the Edinburgh Theatre, where the en-
tire score was lost.

Other Hullah works heard by the 50 in attendance at the Thursday
show were “Some Folks who Have Grown Old” and “How Beautiful at
Eventide,’’ both sung by the soprano.

A number of more melancholy selections were taken from A Tribute
to Alfred, Lord Tennyson, a musical album edited by organist, com-
poser and conductor William G. Cusins.

They included ‘Rain, Rain and Sun” by J oseph Joachim, ‘‘The Lute
Song” by C. Villiers Stanford and ‘Ring Out, Wild Bells” by Charles
Gounod.

The original program afforded some of the best living history of a
culture that ended a short time ago yet is so far removed from our pre-
sent artistic ideals.

Swenson gives a poetry reading

Highly honored writer is
popular with students

By Laura Carmelich

The most honored poet alive, May Swenson
brought her versatile and brilliant craft to campus
Thursday in a true celebration of the arts.

Following a poetry workshop in the Creative Arts
house here, Swenson presented a reading of her
works to an attentive audience of more than 100 in
the University Center Forum.

The first group of poems she read dealt mainly
with the eccentricities of New York City’s in-
habitants. Frequently, these poems sounded more
like prose than verse, as Swenson strung together
long lists of adjectives and descriptive phrases
about her native city.

Swenson termed the next selections her “‘love
poems,” and in these combined traditional roman-
tic language with fresh images of the embracing
and wrestling activities of lovers in the sea.

Following these poems were four selections deal-
ing with science and outer space. Of all Swenson’s
poems, these most clearly showed her striking ver-
satility. At one moment, Swenson attacked the ab-
surdity of space-age jargon; at the next, she was
comparing a satellite view of the earth to the image
of a beautifully graceful woman.

Scattered among these thematic groups were
Swenson’s serious and poignant pieces dealing with
her personal experiences of family, friends and
childhood. In one particularly touching piece — en-
titled ‘Feel Me” — Swenson described the death of
her father and the loneliness of old age.

Swenson read her poems with a tranquil, controll-
ed voice, only occasionally interrupting this

MAY SWENSON

regulated pace with a subtly humorous tone or sud-
den inflection. Still, her vibrant and sensitive
perceptions of the world attracted and held the au-
dience for the length of her presentation.

Swenson was born in Utah and completed her
education at Utah State University in 1939. After
college she moved to New York, settling in Green-
wich Village where among other jobs she worked as
an editor at New Directions Press. While most of
Swenson’s writing career developed in the New
York area, she spent one year in France, Italy and
Spain on an Amy Lowell Traveling Scholarship.

The author of 10 books, Swenson’s most notable
works include Another Animal, A Cage of Spines, To
Mix with Time, Half Sun, Half Sleep and More
Poems to Solve. Her latest collection of poems, New
and Selected Things Taking Place, won her the 1979
Fellowship of the Academy of American Poets.
More recently, Swenson received the Bollingen
Prize in poetry from Yale University, an honor she
shares with Howard Nemerov.

Wilder’s ‘Our Town’ is given a fresh new approach

Cap and Dagger celebrates 80th

with exploration of themes on life

By David Blackman

The fourth Cap and Dagger production of the academic
year opens at 9 tonight in Coleman Theatre. Under the
direction of Allen Haines ’81, “Our Town” marks the
finale of a successful week of artistic events as well as the
g0th anniversary of Cap and Dagger, the University’s
theater organization.

Thornton Wilder’s classic exploration of small town life
has retained popularity over the years due to its timeless
message. But because of its popularity, the play is con-
tinually produced with a decided tendency towards
mediocrity.

Director Haines wishes to overcome this problem.
“This play can be produced on two levels. The first super-
ficially, depicting the simple pleasures of small town life
without emphasizing the crucial message which I believe
Wilder had in mind. Second, it may be produced as a
biting commentary on humanity pointing out the drastic
flaws of our complacent lifestyles. I wish to portray the se-
cond level,’”’ Haines said.

According to the director, the play talks about “‘life in a
bubble” where people exist in a stifled provincial society.
“People have the potential to change and break out of this
bubble, but they choose not to simply because it’s easier
and that’s the way it’s always been,” Haines said.

To convey this theme, which Haines sees as infinitely
more important than the actual plot of “Our Town,” he
has attempted to change the role of the Stage Manager
from that of a mere narrator who becomes a member of
the town and lives within the period — much like the other
characters — to a provoker of thought and action who
spans all periods of time from 1904 to the present and
beyond.

“This play is not a tribute to small towns, but rather

raises disturbing questions. People should leave thinking
about their own lives,” said Barry Fishel, who portrays
the pivotal role.

“Our Town” is very reflective of my own philosophy in
life,” said Gwyn English ’81, who portrays Emily Webb.
“As Emily realizes, if you don’t live your life to the fullest,
appreciate all it has to offer, and realize you don’t live
forever, you miss so much of the love which is basic to our
humanity.”

Besides thematic problems, Haines and Stage Manager
Bruce Delaplane ’81 also had to deal with the more prac-
tical aspects of the production, including the scant three
weeks allowed for rehearsal and crew time after the per-
formance dates were pushed up to fit the Celebration of
the Arts week.

Although many seasoned Cap and Dagger veterans
were cast in “Our Town,” there is much fresh talent as
well.

astonished onlooker—in the 1964 Cap and Dagger production of “Daddy, Oh Daddy, I'm

Several University alumni — including Edward
Herrmann — will be featured in two panel discus-
sions on the theater Saturday afternoon in the
University Center Forum.

A presentation on theater administration featur-
ing Ed Davis, a senior partner in Theatre Now Inc.
in New York, and Peter Schmener and Janice
Eckmann, actors’ representatives, will be held at
1:30 p.m. The three will discuss how to break into
the business side of the theater and how to find an
agent.

Herrmann, Leigh Curran — Herrmann’s wife
and an actress turned playwright — and Richard
Humpirey ’72, a SUCK.oomm sew York direc-
tor/producer, will discuss crafts of the theater to-
day and forces affecting ‘‘The Playwright, the Ac-

tor and the Director” at 3 p.m. that afternoon.

Herrmann, a Tony award winner for 1973's
“Mrs. Warren’s Profession’ with Lynne
Redgrave, is best known for his roles as a rich
young law student in the movie “The Paper
Chase” and as President Franklin D. Roosevelt in
the television series ‘‘Eleanor and Franklin.”

Curran recently finished a play entitied
“Lunchgirls,” currently on option for production
on Broadway.

Humphrey, a young professional director turned.
producer, produced the Pulitzer Prize-winning
play “Buried Child” by Sam Shepard off-
Broadway. He has also been active in directing
professional summer theater.

Reunion is planned
for visiting alumni

More than 100 Cap and Dagger
alumni from as far back as 1939
and as far away as California are
expected for this weekend’s 80th
anniversary of the organization.

The reunion is both a culmina-
tion of Celebration of the Arts
Week and an opportunity for
alumni to view the latest Cap and
Dagger production, Thornton
Wilder’s ‘Our Town.”

“I felt bad that we did not
observe the 75th birthday, and I
expect to be either otherwise oc-
cupied or unoccupied by the
100th, so the 80th seemed ap-
propriate,” Director of the
University Theatre Harvey
Powers said.

Powers, Assistant Director of
Alumni Relations Ray Painter
76, other members of the Alumni
Relations staff and Cap and Dag-
ger President Dodie Rippon ’82
are coordinating the event. Alum-
ni will arrive on Saturday, report
to the information desk of the
University Center and be greeted
by present Cap and Dagger
members.

The visitors will then be shown
a slide show in the UC’s Faculty
Lounge of recent University pro-
ductions, including this year’s
“Tartuffe” and “A Funny Thing
Happened On the Way to the
Forum.”

In keeping with this historical
theme, the theater has organized

HARVEY POWERS

an exhibit in Coleman Hall
displaying programs, pictures
and posters of many Cap and
Dagger shows from 1919 through
the present.

University Theatre secretary,
Melissa Bodine, °81, pored
through files of old pictures and
programs to compile a
chronological order of Cap and
Dagger productions.

The finale of the reunion will be
an on-stage birthday party for
present and past Cap and Dagger
members after Saturday even-
ing’s performance of “Our
Town.”

Creative arts house experiencing
trouble promoting tts events

semester.

Bucknellian

By Lynne Rutherford

Lack of interest and funds appear to have stifled
activities in Hulley House, the University’s creative
arts special interest residence.

When Hulley House was first formed by 17
students in September, Marty Wieland ’83— resi-
dent assistant and leader of the group—said, ‘“‘We’d

“These jam sessions create an outlet for the many
closet musicians on campus,” he said.

Other planned events—a fiddler’s contest and
spring folk festival—are also in jeopardy due to lack
of funds.

“The size and scope of what we can do second
semester entirely depends on how much money we
can raise,” Wieland said.

like to sponsor things that wouldn’t normally be
sponsored by other groups.” Wieland also said the
house’s ultimate goal was to ‘‘provide a center for
the arts on campus.”

Seven months later, as the residence has failed to
take an active part in this week’s Celebration of the
Arts, plans seem to have gone awry.

Although Weiland and MaryAnn LaCroix 81, stu-

dent coordinator of arts week, tried to contact each
other several times, they were never able to make
definite plans. As a result, several events have
utilized the house’s living room, but the Hulley
House group has failed to sponsor anything of its
own.
“Our schedules were just different—we were
never able to get each other on the phone,” said
Wieland. ‘‘They never did get a hold of us and we
never took the initiative.”

Several artistic events—a student poetry reading
and a bluegrass jam session, among others—were
scheduled but for varying reasons—all clouded with
confusion and lack of communication—they fell
through.

BJRE kicks off Celebration

with concert in Larison

The Bucknell Jazz and Rock Ensemble began Cele-
bration of the Arts Week in style with a jazzy dance
concert in Larison Dining Hall Saturday night. As
usual, the high quality brass section anchored the
group's well-timed, talented sound.

Accompanied by vocalists Steve Lu ‘83 and Tracy
Cohen ‘82, the BJRE’s smooth, mellow tones were
music to the ears of many students inundated with
loud fraternity party rock. A change was afforded
to slow dance, relax — and take a break from the

books and classes.

Street theatre troupe has
many messages for onlookers

By Ted Loud

In the midst of the lunchtime
rush hour, the mall of the Univer-
sity Center became the scene of
an unusual and very exciting hap-
pening Thursday afternoon. Sud-
denly, without warning, a street
theater dropped in to present
“The Moveable Feast.”

The steady flow of UC traffic
was invaded by a band of masked
figures dancing to the music of
pre-recorded bongo drums. Com-
ing through the downhill doors,
they paraded through the Bison,
drawing smiles and polite ap-
plause. They stopped for a few
minutes to perform for the busy
and bustling crowd.

The troup then forged a path to
the refectory, where they enter-
tained the unprepared but amus-
ed faculty diners. And then they
were gone.

Although it may have seemed a
bit frivolous, “The Moveable

The street theatre players, with Stu Gay
policy in El Salvador, performs in the groun
group's program, entitled, “The Movable Feast,’

Feast” dealt with relevant
issues, specifically America’s
role in the current situation in El
Salvador. Using simple but ex-
tremely clever and effective
domestic props and working from
a short narrative recited by a
masked story-teller (Stu Gay
82), “Feast’’ presented a view of
the conflict which was highly
critical of U.S. policy.

Drawing on the ‘“‘guns and but-
ter metaphor,” a loaf of bread
was transformed into an airplane
with “U.S.” emblazoned on the
wings. A right wing
“mercenary,” personifying a
repressive junta, then battered a
defenseless Salvadorian into the
ground, with the loaf of bread.

The performances were all
spirited and somewhat disturb-
ing, though never heavy-handed.
The “instant” audience reacted
with surprise and amusement,
everyone apparently happy for
this break in the noon-day
routine.

Jeffry Walker—the visiting
assistant professor of English
and Theater now on leave—said
his objective is to use theater as a
means of dealing with the issues
that affect us all. He said he ob-
jects to the way art has been
“wrapped up and sold” and
would like to see a less formaliz-
ed and threatening atmosphere
surrounding the arts. Ideally, he
envisions a “theatrical SWAT
team” — a group always ready to
present spur-of-the-moment per-
formances about major issues as
they arise.

Walker said this week’s UC
performances are ‘‘spontaneous
and silly’’ reactions to the recent
events in El Salvador, but it is
their very immediacy which he
said gives these performances
their importance.

The street theater will present
“The Moveable Feast” again at
noon Saturday.

WORLD

Polish development
worry U.S. officials

The United States and West
Germany have agreed to try to
use interest expressed by Soviet
leaders in a summit conference
with President Reagan as a
means of leverage to deter the
Russians from military interven-
tion in Poland.

American and West German of-
ficials, separately discussing the
results of Foreign Minister Hans-
Dietrich Genscher’s talks Mon-
day with Secretary of State Alex-
ander Haig, said Tuesday that
both sides were worried about the
possibility of Soviet intervention.

Officials say Cuba

cut aid to Salvador

Recently acquired information
indicates that the anti-
Government insurgents in El
Salvador are running out of am-
munition because of an apparent
decision by Nicaragua and Cuba
to reduce their assistance, ac-
cording to Administration of-
ficials.

Although the officials said
Wednesday that the intelligence
information was not conclusive,
there was a growing belief within
the Administration that the flow
of arms to the left-wing rebels in
El Salvador through Nicaragua
had been drastically cut back for
the past few weeks.

The Reagan Administration
has been careful in handling the
intelligence information because
it does not want to undercut its
justification for giving military
aid to El Salvador.

Officials also said there has
been less activity and involve-
ment by Cuba in helping the El
Salvador rebels recently.

Atlanta mayor seeks

investigation funds

Because of Atlanta’s problem
of financing the investigation of
21 missing and slain children,
Mayor Maynard Jackson is ask-
ing citizens to write their con-
gressman to urge support of addi-
tional federal funds.

“People have asked what they
can do to help,” he said Tuesday
night at a concert to raise funds
for the police task force con-
ducting the investigation. The

and Sammy Davis Jr.

Reagan officials
seek more authority

The newly appointed in-
telligence officials of the Reagan
Administration are asking for
renewed authority to collect in-
formation on Americans in the
United States and abroad, using
searches, physical surveillance
and infiltration of domestic
organizations.

The authority — being sought
through a proposed executive
order — would overturn many of
the restrictions placed on in-
telligence activities by
Presidents Ford and Carter.

A White House spokesman said
Monday that the proposals were
“still under review” and had
been sent to the intelligence com-
munity for comment.

Though now considered secret,
the revised order would become
public and have the force of law if
signed by the president.

Reagan presents
budget to Congress

President Reagan issued a pro-
posal to Congress Tuesday outlin-
ing a $695 billion budget for the
fiscal year 1982 that he explained
is the centerpiece of his plan to
“stop runaway inflation’ and
“revitalize the economy” by
decreasing the role of the federal
government.

In a brief budget message,
Reagan issued a warning to
lawmakers who might oppose the
numerous cuts in many non-
military programs, and ex-
plained that “the next steps are
up to Congress.”

Berrigans guilty of
criminal mischief

The Rev. Daniel Berrigan and
his brother Philip, antiwar ac-
tivists during the 1960s, were
found guilty along with six other
people in Norristown Friday
night of breaking into a General
Electric Co. facility where they
hammered two missile nose
cones and poured blood on official
papers.

In addition to the Berrigans
—one a Jesuit priest and the
other a Josephite priest—the
others charged were Dean Ham-
mer, a divinity student; the Rev.
Carl Kabat; Elmer Maas, a
history professor; Sister Anne
Montgomery; Molly Rush, a
housewife, and John Schuchardt.

All were convicted on charges
of burglary, criminal mischief
and criminal conspiracy, and
each could receive a maximum
sentence of 25 years. The jury

themselves, for seven-and-a-half

Cartesian anxiety
subject of lecture

Richard Bernstein, an expert
on American pragmatism, will
deliver the annual Roy Wood
Sellars Lecture in Philosophy at 8
p.m. Tuesday in the University
Center Forum.

Bernstein, currently chairman
of the department of philosophy
at Haverford College, will give an
address entitled “‘Beyond Objec-
tivism and Relativism: Exorcis-
ing the Cartesian Anxiety.”

The Sellars lectureship was in-
augurated in 1971, shortly before
the death of Sellars, a professor
emeritus at the University of
Michigan. Sellars established the
lectureship here in honor of
Preston Warren, former head of
the University’s philosophy
department, who published a
number of interpretations of
Sellars’ work.

Sellars was instrumental in

EDITORIALS
Leaders and puppets

The unanimous decision of the ABS Congress Tuesday to redirect
its student scholarship program from aiding minority applicants to
aiding those who demonstrate what they call ‘leadership potential”
demonstrates the inferior quality of student leaders already atten-
ding the University. Do we need to encourage more of the same?

Although the vote followed discussions held at three meetings, the
entire congress came to the same conclusion in the end; the Univer-
sity needs “dynamic leaders” more than it needs to encourage
qualified minority students to attend what has been described as a
“white middle-class school.”

It appears that ABS President Michael Suarez has such complete
control over his congress that not even one member voted against
his proposal.

If ABS members are examples of the “dynamic leaders” the
University is so desperately in need of, why are they all of the same
opinion? This is usually expected of followers—not leaders.

It is disturbing to find the scholarship funds redirected at the
whim of the president, not only because of the apparent lack of in-
dependent thinking of the ABS members—whose unity often seems
to be all too staged—but also because of the consequences of their ac-
tions.

At a time when students should be growing, the ABS is regressing;
it has shot down a well intentioned ‘affirmative action” policy of
another congress. $15,000 of our student activities fees will now be
directed to ‘dynamic leaders” in what we see as a euphemistic way
of avoiding ‘“‘reverse discrimination’.

If the Congress is looking for things to do to keep busy and to keep
the attention of its members, it would be better advised to attempt to
display some of the leadership they are looking for themselves,
rather than to seek to “cleanse” themselves of what little vestige of
progressivism remains in their organizazion.

Good Luck

We've heard it said that most people never outgrow the paranoia
they experienced when they were children and a new kid moved in
down the street.

It is quite a different emotion, however, that we greet the
newest—indeed, the only memorable—addition to the journalistic
“block”? on which we have lived alone too long. There is for us no
fear of competition or rivalry as the Bucknell Progressive Caucus
launches its first Catechist. Quite the contrary—we welcome the
company.

In attempting to provide a frequent journal of discussions for
progressive issues, Stu Gay and the other editors of this new publica-
tion are undertaking a worthy but difficult task. The introduction of
any new ideas and ideamakers into a college community is always
welcome, but the method to the madness is probably more con-
voluted and complex than they yet realize. As we sit here at the
printers amidst a mountain of copy and a flurry of rulers and x-acto
knives, we wonder—momentarily—if it’s all worthwhile. Then we
turn back to the typewriter, assured that it is.

We hope you always remain as assured as we are, Catechist.
Good luck.

Seeing green

In a vivid portrayal of American solidarity and pride, we took to
displaying and wearing yellow ribbons two months ago. But the ugly
hostage episode eventually passed, the ribbons were removed and
the nation was able to get back on its feet, a heavy burden lifted from
its shoulders.

Now—in another display of bonded American spirit—students na-
tionwide are sporting green armbands and ribbons. Green sym-
bolizes life, and the armbands and ribbons memorialize the 20
children slain in Atlanta since 1979.

The Black Student Alliance here is to begin distributing the arm-
bands soon; they also plan to raise money to send to the families of
the murdered children. We hope the students here will join with the
Americans nationwide who have donned the ribbons and armbands
as a symbolic display of unity.

And we pray the city of Atlanta will soon be able to get back on its
feet, so its children—and its adults—can begin to lead the happy,
growing lives they are entitled to lead.

Lefever makes human rights u-turn

By Phil Andrews

What do Ernest Lefever, President Reagan’s controver-
sial nominee to head the State Department’s Human
Rights Bureau, and Professor of Political Science and
Religion, Douglas Sturm, have in common?

Not much, except that they have known each other since
1953 when they worked together at Christian Action — an
organization funded by Paul Tillich, Reinhold Niebuhr
and others to fight McCarthyism.

PHILLING IN

es Ea

Of all of Reagan’s appointments, Lefever’s has drawn
the sharpest fire. This is no surprise given Lefever’s
statements regarding human rights policies and
strategies.

To wit: In Congressional testimony in 1974, Lefever
argued against moralizing about government - sponsored
torture in Argentina and Chile because it has to be
understood ‘‘as a residual practice of the Iberian tradi-
tion.”

The New York Times, in an editorial on March 2, noted
“Jt has been Mr. Lefever’s vocation to promote a single
idea: that the United States should not penalize faithful
allies by making too much fuss about any blood on the
carpet.”

On the other hand, Times columnist William Safire
described Lefever as ‘“‘A lesser-of-evils theologian who
believes we must provide arms to allies to put down insur-
rection. Lefever’s aggressive pragmatism appalls
idealists.”

Ignore government,

I asked Sturm about Lefever’s theological philosophy.
He made the following observations.

“Lefever has conceived himself to be a follower of the
Biblical realism of Reinhold Niebuhr — that is, you have
to take into account the hard realities of political and
economic circumstances in making decisions.

“Tt seems to me that in many respects he is, but he does
not discern by orientation with quite the subtlety that
Niebuhr himself did,” he said, citing Lefever’s opposition
to Niebuhr’s criticism of the Vietnam war.

With regard to Lefever’s political philosophy, Sturm
said ‘He sees national self-interest as fundamentally a
moral concept, and each nation must act on behalf of its
self-interest.”

“Thus, a realistic position would require any nation -
state to make sure that it’s got ample power to protect its
boundaries, but also ample power to protect its sphere of
influence,” Sturm said.

l asked Sturm where he disagreed with Lefever.

“For one thing,” Sturm said, “I think the nation - state
system is not as hard and fast as I think he perceives.
There are already political linkages, but also economic
and cultural linkages that means the world is not organiz-
ed in a simple nation - state fashion.”

“These people are quite as realistic in a way as Lefever,
but in another way their realism is deeper and pro-
founder, because they see merging sentiments among
peoples the world around — sentiment that would provide
some kind of grounding in ideas of human rights
understood in the economic and cultural sense.

Third, Sturm argued that “one cannot sit idly by when a
national organization or government is engaged in activi-
ty that oppresses the people who exist within that national
boundary.

“We must admit that our responsibility is not just a dis-

DOUGLAS STURM

tant responsibility of sibling for sibling, for it seems to me
that by various kinds of aid. By virtue of the extent of our
corporations, we are in ways responsible for the condi-
tions of peoples the world around.

“Given that fact, we simply cannot wash our hands. The
important question is not so much interference or non - in-
terference, it’s the character of the interference,” Sturm
said.

As the Times said, Lefever’s ‘‘criticism of human rights
legislation is not frivolous and is worthy of debate. What is
frivolous is nominating him to head a bureau whose func-
tion he derides.”’

celebrate an anarchic revolution

By Britt Clayton

Governments require consent. Their
authority is borrowed. Their decisions are
legitimate and effective only when we
agree to abide by the authority we have
granted them.

There is, however, an inherent problem
in our democratic system of decision mak-
ing. Majority rules. Only a fraction of the
populace has its way in choosing its
leaders.

We, the minority, must succumb to the
brute force of the majority. By virtue of
our number, those men and women
representing our ideals have been denied
office. We have been denied self-
government every time our number was
less.

Do I propose minority rule? No, that
would be as absurd as military or dictator
rule. It is not the number of people respon-
sible for choosing leaders that is in ques-
tion here. It is the concept of ruling at all.

Even the majority has no control over
what their government does once they
have elected it. While the branches of our
government must answer to one another,
they need not reckon with authority until
election day.

Even at the polls, we are allowed to
choose only between the representatives of
our two political parties. In short, our self-
government is limited to deciding which of
the candidates we prefer. Majority deci-
sion. Minority rule.

What do I suggest? Anarchy. While those
of us who are dissatisfied by virtue of our
number cannot decide who rules, that need
not concern us. We have seen that “ruling”
is a perversion of self-government in the
first place. What we may do is withdraw
our consent—ignore their decisions.

The only good government is self-
government. None of us is free unless he is
exclusively under his own control, or
under the consented control of some rule of
which he wholeheartedly approves, in
which case no rule is necessary.

One may interject here: ‘‘How can we
live without organization? Without the
military and the judiciary, we would be in
a state of chaotic vulnerability.”

The response to this censure is two-fold.
First, we must take the law into our own
hands, and secondly, we must remove the
conditions barring us from a more in-
dependent subsistence.

Ina land where people are not reliant on
conglomerate utilities, communications,
industries, money markets and food
distributors, a takeover would have to pro-
ceed one house at a time—against a heavi-
ly armed population.

How many soldiers would it take to stifle
all of our churches?...to seize all of the
family-owned farms?... to shut down all
newspapers?...all hospitals?...every

It is the centralization of resources that
makes a takeover possible. By ridding
ourselves of government and other con-
glomerate parasites that feed on our
laziness, we can restore law and order to
its original source while reuniting the pro-
ductive and consumptive modes of our
lives. As moral agents—agents capable of
producing pain and pleasure in others—we
are obliged to withdraw our consent from
any system of rule which insults our moral

Please Mr. Postman, is
there a letter for me?

By Jim Zimmerman

I stumbled upon a fascinating revelation the other day. Back
when I was a freshman — and God, that seems like a long time ago
— we all had somewhat of a fetish with the mailroom.

No matter what time of the day we passed through the University
Center, there was a perfunctory stop at our boxes. We never seem-
ed to learn that real mail came by 10:30 a.m. and that campus mail
was distributed by three. Five times a day, seven days a week —
even Sunday brunch included a mail check — we inspected our
boxes in the hopes of a delivery.

Maturity set in the summer after freshman year. All of a sudden,
it was no longer cool to check for mail. Sophomore year, one stop
became the daily maximum per person; by the time we were
juniors, it was fashionable to pass through the mail room once a
week.

Most of us fell prey to using the excuse, “Sorry, but I never check
my mail any more.”

Well, now I’m’a senior, and I think I’m wearing the numbers off
of the combination lock on my mailbox. I take comfort in the fact
that I’m not alone. Every time I check for mail, the faces around
me are familiar. Unlike back when we were freshmen, however, we
are not checking five times a day, but 10; we no longer stop every
time we pass through the UC. Now we make special trips.

It’s funny how a Celebration of the Arts brochure looks like a law
school rejection through a little window. Similarly, all around me,
those familiar faces are ‘‘certain’’ that a Sears Credit Card Ap-
plication is a Bank of Maryland secondary interview offer, or that
the little card that says only “‘your file is now complete,” is really
an acceptance letter from the Columbia School of Medicine.

It’s a vicious game, yet we all keep on playing it. The news each
of us wants to see is so rarely there, but not one of us is willing to
take the chance that our acceptance letter could sit there over-
night.

In some ways I feel like a freshman again. But more importantly,
in one way, I wish I were a freshman again. It seems to me it was
more fun to check over and over for a letter from a friend, a
package from home or a five dollar check from a grandmother than
I know it is for most of us to check continually for some type of a
response — and usually find nothing at all.

Jim Zimmerman, a senior political science major from Montoursville,
has been constantly checking his mailbox hoping for a law school
acceptance.

Avant-garde forms next best thing to bones?

To the Editor:

David Blackman described the
exhibit of Diane Stiglich’s objects
by conveniently using quotes
from students like ‘‘wild,”’
“wonderfully disturbing’ and
“just incredible.’’ He was being
too nice.

We have never seen such a
varied display of glittering ob-
jects and avante-garde forms in

our entire lives, and we hope that
we never will again. After
visiting the Center Gallery for the
past few years, this exhibit clear-
ly stands out in our minds as the
next best thing to last year’s bone
exhibit.

Instead of transforming the art
prints, man-made objects and
photographs into sparkling crea-

tions, they would be better left
alone. Stiglich wants to imitate
real life and evoke images of
nature through man-made
things. Nature is already polluted

enough.

A ‘generous’ contribution puts arts in its place

To the Editor:

On behalf of the Creative Arts House, I would like
to thank the ABS for their generous contribution to
our cause. Last Tuesday night, they appropriated a
whopping $35 for the promotion of the creative arts
at Bucknell.

Now I realize that our original request of $350 was
totally unreasonable. After all, we are not a major
concern like the Rifle Club (which received $600 this
year). The arts have their own little place at
Bucknell, and they should stay there.

I was surprised that we got the $35. Some of our
items were a bit unreasonable, which the Ap-
propriations Committee was quick to point out. $10
for poster board was admittedly extravagant, since
20 posters for a semester’s worth of activities could
easily lead to an advertising overkill. Our other
items were likewise subjected to the committee’s
penetrating scrutiny, but in the end we came $35
richer.

Thanks, ABS. You're a helluva group.

Eight records give women ’s track seventh in East

ByS. J. FURMAN

The Women’s Track team
broke eight school records on its
way to a seventh place finish
Saturday and Sunday at the first
Division XI Eastern AIAW In-
door Woman’s Track Meet at
Boston College.

Villanova took first in the 15-
team competition, followed close-
ly by West Chester and Maine.
Coach Diane Ware said she was
extremely pleased with the
squad’s performance — they
placed in 10 events and captured
sixth or better in other events in

which Bucknell competed.

Having gained varsity status in
1976-77, the trackwomen’s per-
formance is impressive and im-
proved, as this young team
qualified only four members in
the All-Division Championship
held at Harvard last year.

Photo—Dave Folsom

The women’s track team completed its season with a dual meet record of 4-1 and shat-
tered eight school records at the Eastern AIAW meet at Boston College last weekend.

Freshman Nancy Russo began
the Bisons’ attack, setting three
University records. She took a se-
cond place finish in the long jump
with a record-breaking leap of 17
feet, 5% inches — 10 inches
longer than the previous mark
she set in December — and bet-
tered the school record by more
than a foot. Russo also captured
fifth in the 55-meter dash with a
time of 7.6 seconds, and she
sprinted 300 meters in 44.4
seconds — fast enough for a new
Bucknell record, but not fast
enough to qualify her for the
finals.

Sophomore Beth Bittel placed
third in the shotput with a 12.41
meter toss, having taken eighth
in the event at last year’s cham-
pionship. Junior Co-captain Lin-
da Accettura took a fourth place

finish in the 800 meter run with a
record 2:29.1. Lonnie Fertik ’83
captured fifth in the pentathalon
with a new Bucknell total of 3,170,
bettering the school record (her
own) of 3,091.

The distance medley relay
team of Karen Flanagan ’84, Co-
captain Suzanne Hecker ’82, Deb-
bie Passmore ’84, and Accettura
took a fifth place finish in a
record 12:52.2. Passmore had
earlier captured sixth in the
1,500-meter event — also in a
record 4:53. Sophomore Julie
Crossman broke the Bucknell
record for the 5,000-meter run,
taking a sixth place in 19:15.1.

Bucknell’s scoring was round-
ed out by two sixth place finishes
posted by Stacey Nicholson "84
and Hecker in the 3000-meter and
600-meter events, respectively.

St. Joe’s victorious in ECCs , ‘
by upsetting American, 63-60

By JEFF CROSS

PHILADELPHIA—Despite the absence of the
once Breakin’ Bisons for the first time since 1978,
the East Coast Conference basketball champion-
ships went on here last weekend—and ended with
a titillating finish.

Traditional conference power St. Joseph’s
staged a furious rally in the final three minutes to
upend ECC regular season champion American,
63-60, before 6,150 fans at the Palestra Saturday.
The triumph by St. Joe’s avenged an 84-83 setback
to the Eagles three weeks ago and gave the
Hawks an automatic berth in the NCAA champion-
ships.

In the semifinals Friday night, American

trounced Rider—quarterfinal round conquerors of
Bucknell March 2 by a 68-50 score—99-80 while St.
Joe’s handed Lafayette a 73-63 setback.
. American was selected for the 32-team National
Invitational Tournament and,.was eliminated by
Toledo 91-83 Wednesday to finish 24-6. St. Joe’s put
its 22-7 record on the line in an NCAA preliminary
round contest against Missouri Valley Conference
winner Creighton (21-8) Thursday night in Dayton,
Ohio. The winner plays nationally first-ranked
DePaul (28-1) in the quarterfinals of the mideast
regional Saturday.

In Friday’s first semifinal contest, St. Joe’s
made seven of its first eight shots to streak to a
16-6 lead over Lafayette as the Leopards canned
only two of 10 attempts.

The Hawks showed their 2,500 fans a superior
brand of basketball in increasing their lead to 33-15
at halftime on 64 percent shooting and a 17-10 re-
bounding edge.

Despite hitting 13 more field goals than their op-
ponents in a second half comeback attempt, the
Leopards never got closer than the final margin of
10 points. The Hawks maintained their lead with
26-34 accuracy at the charity stripe while Lafayette
went to the line 14 times—hitting only eight—in the
foul-filled second half.

All-ECC forward Boo Williams of St. Joe’s led all
scorers with 22 points and had game highs of eight
rebounds and three blocked shots.

A fast-breaking offense and rapid ball movement
enabled American to roll to a 49-37 halftime lead
over Rider in the second semifinal as the Eagles hit
65 percent of their shots.

Although the Broncs played more cohesively
throughout the game than in their sloppily-played
quarterfinal victory over the Breakin’ Bisons, Rider
lacked the depth and stamina to catch American.
The Eagles continued their hot shooting from both
the field and the free-throw line to streak to a 19
point win.

St. Joe’s reeled off six unanswered points to tie
the hotly-contested championship game 54-54 when
Lonnie McFarlan converted a steal into a driving
layup. McFarlan was fouled on the play and his free
throw gave the Hawks a 57-54 lead with 2:27 left.

American then scored six of the next eight points
to retake the lead, 60-59, with :58 left when Sloane
made a steal at midcourt and scored on a driving
layup. Center Tony Costner scored the game-
winning points for St. Joe’s 17 seconds later with a
short bank shot, giving him 23 points for the night.

Bryan Warrick sealed the win for St. Joe’s with a
pair of free throws with two seconds left to give the
Hawks a 63-60 margin and a trip to the NCAAs.

Hockey freezes Dickinson 2-0
for seventh consecutive victory

By JEFF CROSS

MECHANICSBURG — Climax-
ing its winningest season ever,
the Ice Hockey Club edged
Dickinson 2-0 here Tuesday for its
seventh straight win and a final
13-3-1 record.

By beating the Red Devils
twice and tying them once this
year, the Nukes took a com-
manding 4-2-2 lead over Dickin-
son in the three-year-old
Challenge Cup.

Goaltender Ron Borcherdt ’81
was the key to the victory, turn-
ing aside 28 Red Devil shots to
record his and the Nukes’ first
shutout of the season. Borcherdt
lowered his goals against
average to 3.4 goals per game
with a variety of dazzling glove
and stick saves to silence the 110
vocal Dickinson followers at the
Skateium.

Jeff Kaighn ’83 notched the
eventual game - winner with a
low, hard slap shot from the blue
line 1:30 into the second period
after receiving a breakout pass
from Fid Speer ’80. Paul Devlin
°83 sealed the triumph with four
seconds left in the game by scor-
ing an empty net goal with the
Red Devil goaltender benched in
favor of an extra skater.

As in their 7-3 win over the Red
Devils Feb. 27, the Nukes used
aggressive forechecking and
hard hitting to slow the Dickinson
attack. Defensemen Devlin,
Chris Rising ’83 and Hugh
Thornhill 81 made numerous
goal-saving clears in front of the
Nukes’ goal and prevented any
wide open Red Devil shots.

While being outshot 13-5 in the
first period, Bucknell had trouble
getting untracked after a 10-day
layoff. Nevertheless, Borcherdt
was flawless in the nets, making
several saves while being screen-
ed by the congestion in the
Bucknell zone.

The Nukes’ passes started to
connect in the second stanza as
the action continued fast and
furious. On a power play midway
through the period, Kaighn and
classmates Remi Johnson and
Dan Fitzpatrick bombarded the
Dickinson cage with numerous
scoring chances, but to no avail.
The home team held a 10-6 shots
on goal advantage for the period.

In the final period, Speer, Stalio
Boyd ’80 and Jeff Cross ’82 con-
tinuously harassed the Dickinson
defensemen to create frequent
chances, but their shots could not

find the mark. Bucknell lost its
best chance for an insurance goal
when Devlin hit the goal post with
six minutes left after skating the
length of the ice and faking his
way past the Dickinson goalie.

Hustling forwards Stu Vaeth
84, Bill Lightfoot ’82 and Chuck
Zaleski ’83 assisted the first two
lines in pressuring the Red Devils
into making mistakes as time ran
down. As they had throughout the
game, the Red Devils continued
to skate furiously in search of the
tying goal. Dickinson gambled by
pulling its goaltender with two
minutes remaining and managed
several solid chances — but Bor-
cherdt was equal to the task.

Finally, Devlin silenced the
partisan crowd with an empty net
goal from center ice to set off a
wild celebration by the Nukes’
net.

The Nukes were outshot for on-
ly the third time in 17 outings,
28-14, but the territorial play was
even. Bucknell committed only
one penalty—a season low—and
the hosts were whistled down but
three times in the clean but hard

Skiers place 1 4th in Nationals

Marquette, Michigan was the setting of the Na-
tional Collegiate Ski Association Championships
last weekend, where 16 ski racing teams from
= the country competed to decide the nation’s

The Bucknell Ski Racing team, the Allegheny
Collegiate Ski Conference Champions, finished a
distant 14th, but as the team’s founder, Jack
Snyder ’82 said, ‘We were tremendously happy to
have come this far in our first year.”

Ingvar Christophersen ’81 placed 33rd out of a
field of 80 in the slalom to start the first day of the
two-day tourney. Christophersen’s time of 85.786
seconds bested teammate Snyder’s 97.686 — good

enough for 53rd — while Peter Orr ’84 crossed the
line at 104.136 to finish right behind Snyder at 55th.

Ron Reynier ’82, the fourth member of the team,

suffered a fall because of an equipment failure
and was unable to complete the course. =

In the giant slalom, the Bucknell contingent
placed Christophersen, Snyder and Orr at 35,42
and 52, respectively.

The College of Idaho, Plymouth State College
and St. Olaf of Oregon finished in the top three
spots in the meet, which is for teams who do not
race in the NCAA. Bucknell’s racers bested both
Oregon State and the University of Southern
California.

These words of praise are Coach Charlie Woollum’s way of
describing Bison Captain Al Leslie ’81, Bucknell’s all-time leading
scorer and a member of the East Coast Conference all-star first
team two years ina row.

The 6’3” guard, who was a second team selection in 1979, joins a
sterling team featuring Boo Williams. of St. Joseph’s, Neal Robin-
son of Temple, Kevin Lynam of La Salle and Len Hatzenbeller of
Drexel, also chosen as ECC most valuable player.

Leslie is the only player from the Western Division to make the
first team and as far as value is concerned, Woollum has his own
ideas. ‘‘He is a great player and a great person and has brought
new life to basketball in this area.”

Leslie set school records for most points in a career (1,973, an 18.1
average for 109 games), most points in a season with 564 in 1979—he
had 537 this year, points in a single game, (45 against American in
1979) and his 109 games played is alsoa Bucknell best.

The Bison captain also holds records for field goals in one season
and career, with 227 and 796, respectively, and free throws in a

career, with 381.

Sayre places fifth
in 5,000 at IC4As

Junior Rick Sayre’s fifth place
finish in the 5000-meter run was
the top performance of seven
Bucknell competitors at the IC4A
championships last weekend at
Jadwin Gymnasium in Prince-
ton, N.J.

Sayre finished in 14:34 seconds
while teammates Bill Reifsnyder
84 and Glenn Gibney ’83 placed
seventh and ninth in 14:30 and
14:39, respectively.

In the 1000-meter run, East
Coast Conference champion
Steve Bigotto ’82 clocked 2:32.1 in
the semifinals, failing to qualify

for the finals. In the same event,
senior Mike Debraggio cruised to
a 2:32 finish in his preliminary
heat but did not make the semis.

Bucknell’s lone competitor in
the field events was pole-vaulter
Jamie Dodd ’83, who cleared 14
feet, 11.25 inches. Dodd narrowly
missed qualifying for the finals
when nudged the bar at 15 feet, 5
inches.

Also competing were sopho-
more Mark Hulme in the 1500-
meter run and freshman Mike
Geraghty in the 500 meters.
Neither qualified for the finals.

Panel requests
release of funds
to student group

By JAN BALAKIAN

The dispute between the members of the
Recycling Club and the group’s former ad-
visor concerning the possession and use of
the club’s funds raised under his advisor-
ship was ended by the University Commit-
tee on Complementary Activities Thurs-
day.

The committee sent a recommendation
to University President Dennis O’Brien
that the funds currently held in a private
bank account of Chairman and Professor
of Mechanical Engineering Charles Coder
be transferred to the University Student
Organization account, with use of the
funds to be determined by the current
members of the organization.

The committee was charged by the ABS
Congress Oct. 13 to review the dispute bet-
ween Coder and the club members and for-
mulate a recommendation to settle the
issue.

Coder had refused to let club members
use the $4,633 raised under his advisorship,
maintaining that the money was raised
with the intention of establishing a scholar-
ship fund to aid a needy Lewisburg student
attending the University.

The present club members asserted that
the funds belonged to the club and the use
of the funds should be controlled by the
club. After reviewing University policy
and documents provided by the Recycling
Club, it was determined that no commit-
ment to any goal had been made, and thus
the present membership must determine
the funds use. However, the history of in-
terest in a scholarship was recognized and
the committee recommended that this in-
terest be maintained.

“The Lewisburg residents will feel
deceived” Coder said in response to the
decision.

Former President of the Recycling Club
Bob Doms ’81 said he was pleased with the
action, though he said the first priority
must still be to expand the recycling both
on campus and in town.

Tt was when Doms was the group’s presi-
dent that the funds controversy began.

Zeller said “‘if a club acts against the ad-
visor’s wishes, then the advisor can
resign,” and that the ‘‘continuing

The ABS Congress will reopen
debate and hear suggestions for
amendments and revisions to its
March 10 proposal which would
have redirected an ABS spon-
sored scholarship from
specifically promoting minorities
to one which would promote
‘Jeaders,’’ ABS President
Michael Suarez ’82 said Tuesday.

Suarez made this announce-
ment at the conclusion of a
special 90-minute meeting of the
ABS Steering Committee and the
Black Student Alliance members.

Tuesday’s meeting of ABS and
BSA leaders came at the request
of Suarez after he received
“some 30 phone calls” over the
weekend questioning the ABS
scholarship proposal—some of
which accused the student
government and Suarez of
racism—from students who read
the report of the redirection of the

nellian

scholarship funds in Friday’s
Bucknellian.

Suarez said it is a “probable
outcome” that the proposal will
be amended to include a ‘‘diver-
sity stipulation,” which would
again include minorities as a
specific target of the scholar-
ships.

The debate on the direction

and intention of the ABS

Scholarship actually

originated in 1969. See page 6.

The ABS “made a mistake”’ by
not making its intentions “suffi-
ciently clear,” Suarez said. The
intentions of the scholarship pro-

1 will be made “crystal
clear” at the ABS meeting Mon-
day, he said.

Suarez said the original intent
of the ABS scholarship—which
since 1969 has been supported
with $5 of each student’s ac-
tivities fee, for a total current

Ferguson will officially offer resignation

By MATT KARANIAN

Vice President for University Relations
John Ferguson “‘has indicated that he will of-
fer his resignation” officially within ‘‘a cou-
ple of days,” University President Dennis
O’Brien said Thursday.

O’Brien said he expects Ferguson to resign
effective the end of the academic year.

A candidate for Ferguson’s soon-to-be
vacated position met with Chairman of the
Trustees’ Committee on University Relations
James Roser ’50 Saturday, indicating that the
University has begun a serious effort to
replace the current vice president.

Roser confirmed that Ferguson had been
asked to resign—the first and as yet only
University official to publicly do so—but he
refused to name the candidate with whom he
spoke last weekend or to name any other peo-

scholarship funds during a meeting of the ABS Steering Com-
mittee and members of the Black Student Alliance Tuesday

ple being considered for the position.

The University is considering candidates
for the post who are ‘‘from both outside and
inside Bucknell,” Roser said in an interview
from his home in Colorado Springs this week,
adding that “in respect to the parties in-
volved,” he could not disclose any names.

A new vice president should be on the job
“in fairly short order” compared to ‘‘the time
it took last time,” he said. Ferguson was
hired in June after a one-year search by the
University.

It is hoped the vacancy can be filled before
the trustees convene for their semi-annual
meeting in May, Roser said.

O’Brien said, however, that he “can’t see
anything happening” before ‘June 30 or
September 1,” and that until then, everyone
“will continue in the mode we’re in now.”

Ferguson’s resignation—which, although
requested by the University, has yet to be of-
ficially filed—is not expected to delay a
planned $30-$50 million fund-raising cam-
paign scheduled culminating in 1987, O’Brien
said.

O’Brien said he is filling the responsibility
of the vice president ‘‘to some extent.”

Ferguson said he was ‘‘not in a position to
discuss the matter” when asked Monday, and
refused then to confirm or deny the Universi-
ty’s request that he resign. He also declined to
comment on his status with the University
after O’Brien’s statement Thursday.

O’Brien refused to disclose when he
originally asked Ferguson to submit his
resignation, saying only that the University
has ‘been aware that Ferguson will resign for
some small period of time.”

Grant distribution
questioned by ABS

congress members

By SUSAN MACDONALD

A proposal to shift the em-
phasis of the University’s finan-
cial aid Talent Grant Program
away from athletics and toward
an equal sharing among athletes,
academics and the arts was
discussed at the ABS Congress
meeting Monday.

The proposal, drafted by
Freshman Class President Dan
Huck ’84, suggests an equal split
of 33 percent of the funds be
distributed among the three
areas, beginning in the 1983-84
academic year.

The current policy concerns 40
percent of the total funds
available for financial aid. This
percentage is distributed through
a Talent Grant Program to
students who demonstrate
special abilities. Of these funds,
60 percent is earmarked for
athletes — with the remainder to
be decided on a case by case
basis, Huck said.

In the discussion of the pro-
posal, Jim Mitchell ’83 said “the

proposal doesn’t represent the
views of the student body.” Trax
Dorm Council President Steve
Habetz ’84 said “‘the grant should
be distributed in proportion to the
number of students involved in
the activities.”

“Cutting the Talent Grant Pro-
gram for athletes from 60 to 33
percent is not practical. We know
that will never happen,” ABS
President Michael Suarez °82
said. Suarez suggested freezing
the level of funds currently
pegged to athletes, and putting
the remaining 40 percent of the
Talent Grant funds “‘to better
use.”

At the conclusion of the discus-
sion, Huck was asked to redraft
the proposal, taking into con-
sideration the points raised dur-
ing the meeting. Director of Ad-
missions Richard Skelton, Direc-
tor of Financial Aid Ronald
Laszewski and Director of
Athletics Bruce Corrie will be
asked to attend the next meeting
to offer their comments and ad-
vice on the proposal.

Panel establishes a press coverage policy

By LISA CERUTI

The University Committee on Instruction
voted Tuesday to permit the press to attend
its weekly meetings at the discretion of the
chairman of the committee.

The decision followed the exclusion of a
Bucknellian reporter from the committee’s
March 10 meeting and discussion by the com-
mittee on establishing a policy to address the
issue.

Committee member and WVBU News
Director Todd Buchholz ’83 made a motion
Tuesday to “open the meetings at the discre-
tion of the chairman unless they deal with
personnel matters.”

Associate Professor of Religion Joseph
LaBarge, the voice vote on the motion was not
unanimous but ‘the people who voted af-
firmatively were definitely in the majority.”

Associate Professor of Chemistry John
Cooper, who has been acting as secretary of
the committee, said the vote was “just a ma-
jority” and refused to comment further.

Buchholz said ‘‘the new policy should have
some advantages for both students and the
committee itself. Hopefully, students will be
made aware of committee proposals and the
committee will get more reaction from those
who will be affected most by its actions.”

fessor of Sociology Judith Lasker said she
“believes in freedom of the press’” and sees
“no reason ordinarily to exclude them.”

Lasker said the committee’s actions are
meant to serve the community and, if people
are interested, they should be able to attend
meetings. “It’s a rare occasion that we
discuss something so sensitive that reporters
should be excluded,” Lasker said.

The Committee on Instruction is the only
standing committee that has voted on a
policy concerning the press’ right to attend
meetings, according to Provost Wendell
Smith. “I have heard nothing about the mat-
ter from any of the other committees,” Smith

According to Committee Chairman and

Departmental minors are ‘in’:
faculty approves new program

By BILL THUM

A proposal to establish Departmental Minor Pro-
grams was unanimously passed by the faculty of the
College of Arts and Sciences at its meeting Thurs-
day.

The proposal, developed by the Curriculum Com-
mittee of the college, is intended to achieve a better
balance between the depth and breadth of educa-
tional programs, according to Chairman and Pro-
fessor of History Michael Payne.

Payne said motivation for the proposal grew out
of interest in the foreign language departments to
encourage students to learn a foreign language
while majoring in a different field. According to the
proposal, a balance would also be promoted bet-
ween a liberal and preprofessional education.

“Through the establishment of a structure in
determining the requirements for a minor, students
will be made aware and encouraged to investigate
their interests,” Payne said. In addition, the minor
can diversify a student’s education by crossing bet-
ween the bachelor of arts and bachelor of science
degree programs, according to the proposal.

One of the major concerns of the faculty during
discussion was the possibility of double counting of
courses. Associate Professor of Religion William
Becker questioned the structuring of the minor pro-
posal ‘‘on the possible effect of students neglecting
the double major and instead settling on a minor.”

This would lead to a shrinking of the students
depth of interest and educational experience in-
stead of expanding through use of the minors,
Becker said.

Payne said, ‘“‘the committee had decided that the
University had an obligation to develop the minor to
encourage student programs and interests to be
followed beyond the requirements for majors and
degree distributions.”

Professor of Religion and Political Science
Douglas Sturm questioned the possible conflicts the
proposal would have on the work of the Special
Committee on Curricular Reform which was form-
ed to debate the issue of changes in distributional
requirements in the degree programs.

Dean of the College Robert Chambers said the
proposal would pose no problem and had already
received the committee’s recommendation.

The regulations regarding the departmental
minor stipulate a load of four, five or six courses in
each department. Once proposed and approved by
the college’s curriculum committee, the minor can
only be changed in the same manner as departmen-
tal majors. Changes will not be approved for in-
dividual students, although the departments may
include options for their minors within this pro-
gram.

The program will begin immediately, with pro-
posals to be made to the Curriculum Committee.

Area anti-nuclear group
to stage a demonstration

By ANNE PAVUK

A protest against nuclear energy sponsored by the Buffalo Valley
Chapter of the Susquehanna Alliance — an organization opposed to the
planned operation of Pennsylvania Power and Light’s nuclear power
plant near Berwick — is scheduled from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Saturday in
front of the United States Post Office on 3rd and Market Streets.

The “‘vigil’”’ has been organized as a protest in recognition of the sec-
ond anniversary of the accident at Three Mile Island on March 28,
1979.

The Buffalo Valley Chapter is a branch of the Susquehanna Alliance,
an organization formed in 1976 which includes members from
throughout eastern Pennsylvania. The local group, consisting of ap-
proximately 20 active members, originated in 1979.

According to Mary Ostrander, a member of the local chapter, the
vigil will include the distribution of leaflets on nuclear energy, the
demonstration of members carrying signs and hourly showings of
“Harrisburg,” a movie depecting people’s reactions to the accident at
Three Mile Island.

Ostrander said the Buffalo Valley Chapter attempts to educate the
public through public speakers, film series and letters to the editors of
local papers. ‘‘We are striving to make people aware of not just the
hazards of nuclear energy but also of viable alternatives,” she said.

The group discussed plans for the upcoming protest and organized a
“etter writing campaign’”’ during its March 12 meeting held at SA of-
fices at 42442 Market Street, according to Tony Sade, a member of the
organization.

David Mann, another member, said the Buffalo Valley Chapter has
been concentrating its anti-nuclear energy campaign on the Berwick
plant because there is no organized chapter there.

Mann said there has not yet been any ‘‘active opposition”’ in Berwick
and the benefits of increased employment opportunities provided by
the plant have “‘allayed the fears”’ of area residents.

Of the two Berwick power plant units under construction, one is 90
percent completed and the other 50 percent completed, according to
Mann. He said the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has already been
petitioned for operating licenses and — if the licenses are granted —
the first unit will begin operating in June 1983.

Mann said that although there are few University students involved
in the Buffalo Valley Chapter, the organization has been working with
the Bucknell Progressive Caucus in planning the ‘‘Energy Fair ’81”
scheduled for Sunday, Monday and Tuesday and sponsored by the
BPC:

Committee imposes sanctions
on student guilty of violations

By ANDREW D. MARSH

A student found guilty by local and University
authorities of discharging a fire extinguisher in a
residence hall has been ordered to exclude himself
from all nonacademic - related activities on cam-
pus.

The Committee on Student Conduct imposed the
sanction on David Brond after finding him guilty
March 7 of six violations of the University Regula-
tions Relating to Conduct.

“His actions were a flagrant violation of the
University’s standards and expectations,’ Commit-
tee Chairman and Associate Professor of Political
Science Tom Travis said.

Six punishments handed down by the committee
were put into effect Wednesday, ranging from a pro-
hibition from living or eating in any University or
fraternity housing — Brond had lived at the Delta
Upsilon fraternity house — to a prohibition against
his attending all social events here, from fraternity
parties to the pre-graduation “‘tent party.”

The 21-year-old senior will be immediately
dismissed from Bucknell and denied his degree if he
fails to comply with the punishments, Travis said.

The last time a student disciplinary case was
heard to completion by the Committee on Student
Conduct was 1977, when one student was placed on
probation for harassing two others, according to
Assistant Dean of Student Affairs Joseph Mam-
mola.

Brond was convicted of discharging a fire ex-
tinguisher in the formal living room of Vedder Hall
Dec. 6 during a party 50 members of Delta Phi Ep-
silon sorority were having to commemorate the
chartering of the former Delta Lambda Pi chapter
here as a part of the national organization.

According to Travis, more than $700 in damage
was done to the carpeted and expensively
upholstered room, which contains Colonial fur-
niture and a grand piano.

Mammola and Campus Security were immediate-
ly summoned to the scene following the incident, at
which time Brond was identified and apprehended.
Many of the people attending the party experienced
respiratory congestion, headaches and abdominal
cramps for a few days following the incident which
they attributed to exposure to the fire extinquisher’s
chemical powder emission, according to testimony
at the committee’s hearing.

Acting Chief of Security Michael Amarante cited
Brond for criminal mischief for firing the ex-
tinguisher, and he (Brond) later pleaded guilty
before District Magistrate Leo Armbruster. He was
fined a total of $56 by the borough and was also
ordered to pay DPE President Katharyn Olson ’81
$35 for replacement and cleaning of the belongings
of some DPE members.

DPE filed the charges against Brond for viola-
tions of Bucknell’s conduct code. During the hearing
before the committee — composed of two ad-
ministrators, five students and three faculty
members — Brond maintained he was not intox-
icated during the incident and that his actions were
spontaneous.

Travis said Brond has chosen not to appeal and,
when contacted by the Bucknellian this week, Brond
said he had ‘‘no comment”* except a pledge that he
“will be complying with the restrictions.”

Travis said that “the committee seriously con-
sidered suspending the student from the University,
but instead chose to impose severe disciplinary pro-
bation.”

BAAA holds apartheid colloquium;

Sullivan Principles called ineffective

By M.E. WEIL
The Sullivan Principles — a “‘code of corporate
conduct”’ that calls for improved lixing and work
conditions for South African blacks — are ineffec-
tive in lessening discrimination in a system where
there is apartheid, sociologist David Massey said
here Tuesday.

Massey, speaking during a two-day colloquium
sponsored by the Bucknell Alliance Against Apar-
theid, spoke against the very principles that are a
key element in the University’s tentative plan for
selective divestiture of its holdings in companies
with subsidiaries in South Africa.

As part of the colloquium, the BAAA, which is ac-
tively seeking total divestiture of University stock,
is circulating a petition proposing that the Universi-
ty eliminate “corporations with direct or indirect
investments in South Africa and banks of lending in-
stitutions extending loans to the government of
South Africa” from its investment portfolio.

Divestiture ‘‘undermines the morality of whites in
South Africa” according to Wandile Kuse of the
University of Illinois, who spoke on the historical
perspectives of South Africa Tuesday night in the
Olin Science Auditorium.

The colloquium — entitled “South Africa: Can it
be Defused” — also included Assistant Professor
Barbara Brown of Mount Holyoke College, who
spoke on ‘‘Women Under Apartheid’’ Monday.

Brown said President Reagan does not support
United Slates divestiture of American corporations.
She quoted Reagan as saying that South Africa is a
“friend’’ of the United States and ‘‘we should deal
with them as a friendly nation.”

According to BAAA co-coordinator Masato Aoko
”82, the colloquium was intended to “‘bring the apar-
theid issue to the attention of the University com-
munity. We want to get people interested, concern-
ed and at least better informed,’ he said.

Carolyn Berner ’81, the other eo-coordinator of
the group, said the University has more than $4.5
million invested in corporations affiliated with
South Africa.

According to Berner, the Sullivan Principles are
not specific enough to provide an effective solution
to the problem of apartheid.

In addition to the three lectures, the movies ‘‘Last
Grave at Dimbaza’’ and “There is no Crisis” were
shown Monday and Tuesday nights in the Olin
Science Auditorium.

Progressive Caucus cancels an ROTC protest rally

Dear President O’Brien:

It has come to the attention of the members of the Bucknell Progressive Caucus that

the local ROTC unit plans to engage in war games that will originate here, on campus,
certainly with the use of trucks and possibly with helicopters on March 21 and April 10,
1981.

For many years, a large number of individuals and groups have argued against and
demonstrated against the presence of the ROTC at Bucknell, though perhaps not during
your term as president. The argument has always been the same one: there is no place at
an institution of learning for a military organization, the structure of which is based on
command and a total lack of freedom of thought or action and the end of which is to
prepare for killing.

The humane values of free inquiry and challenge, curiosity, and the shaking loose
from received opinions that Bucknell must profess to stand for as a university are entirely
negated by the rigid authoritarianism of the military. Furthermore, the most decent im-
pulses of men — to live in harmony with one’s neighbor, to turn the other cheek, to reach
out a helping hand rather than to thrust a fist — values, again, that a true university must
support, are affronted by bayonnets and helicopter blades.

Therefore, we ask to have a meeting with you as soon as possible in which we can
discuss stopping this planned ROTC ‘‘exercise” and in which we can raise the larger
issues of why Bucknell is the host to a regional collection of college ROTCs and why
Bucknell has an ROTC unit on its campus. Our letter comes late, does not give you much
time to respond, but that is because the Army is not an open institution; it does not adver-
tise its plans in advance, there is no ROTC syllabus for playing killing games.

Should you not be able to persuade the ROTC to stop their maneuvers or to meet with
us beforehand, rest assured that the Bucknell Progressive Caucus will make its own
presence known on March 21 and April 10.

Meeting requested to discuss prohibiting maneuvers

By SUSAN MacDONALD

The Bucknell Progressive
Caucus’ planned protest rally
against the Reserve Officer
Training Corps (ROTC) tactical
maneuvers Saturday has been
dropped since the nature of
ROTC’s program has come to
light.

The caucus, which sent a letter
to University President Dennis
O’Brien in protest of the
maneuvers, originally expected
the ROTC to be ‘‘using
helicopters which would have
made the situation more
realistic,” BPC member Britt
Clayton ’81 said in reference to
his conversations with Director
of Military Science Lt. Col.
James King.

Since then, however, the
helicopters have been ruled out.

“These plans were not solid, and
earlier this week we learned that
it was not that big of a deal,”
Clayton said.

Director of Public Affairs for
Military Science Capt. Michael
Thornburgh said the exercises
are ‘‘totally voluntary, extra -
curricular activities for whoever
wants to participate. It can be
compared to an adventure club —
we will be doing orienteering and
rappelling.”

Thornburg also said the trip
will have nothing to do with the
campus. ‘‘We will be meeting and
driving off in vans to a State
forest.”

Although the protest of the
maneuvers has been dropped, the
ROTC’s leadership labs have also
been contended by the BPC. At

the BPC meeting Thursday,
Steve Habetz ’84 said the monthly
labs are used to teach the use of
“hand grenades, land mines and
guns.”

Battalion Commander Randy
Cassidy ’81 said the labs were
mandatory for juniors, seniors
and freshmen and sophomore
scholarship cadets, but for all
others it was voluntary.

“It prepares the juniors and
seniors for what to expect when
attending summer camp, where
they will be tested on these types
of things,” Cassidy said.

Congress approves a proposal
for an increase in coed dorms

By SUSAN MACDONALD

The Association of Bucknell
Students passed a petition Mon-
day asking the Office of Residen-
tial Life for two additional coed
floors to be included in this
spring’s room selection.

The action followed a task force
report by ABS Vice President
Missy Campbell ’82 on student
housing. The report specifically
dealt with coed dorms because of
the ‘‘positive response of students
to the coed system,’’ Campbell
said.

In an interview with Campbell,
Director of Residential Life Bren-

da Gordon said that — although
the office is not barraged by
students requesting coed dorms
— the students currently living on
them seem to think they provide
a “good experience,’’ according
to the vice president.

“Contrary to popular thought,
the coed situation fosters a ‘fami-
ly’ atmosphere with relationships.
between students not unlike
brothers and sisters,”’ she said.

Although no dorm was
specified in the ABS petition,
Gordon said that physically,
Swartz lends itself better to coed

housing — particularly New
Swartz, with its common lounges.

The congress settled on two
coed halls in its petition in reac-
tion to Campbell’s report of Gor-
don’s statement that the demand
did not warrant a large increase
in the number of coed halls,
Campbell said.

Campbell also reported on the
possibility of establishing coed
halls in the Freshman Quad.
Although the Office of Residen-
tial Life does not consider this
feasible for the next school year,
Campbell reported that it could
be considered in the future.

ABS scholarship debate dates to 1969

Debate on the ABS Scholarship—which last week
saw the ABS Congress redirect its funds from one
for minorities to one explicitly for leaders—
originated morethan ten years ago, when the
congress debated whether to even provide the
scholarship.

According to a report in the Oct. 24, 1969
Bucknellian, the theme “diversify” was ‘“‘running
through” the ABS meeting that week, upon a
presentation by the Congress’ Admissions Commit-
tee.

It was planned for an ‘“‘Ad Hoc Committee on Dif-
ferently Prepared Students” to be chosen at the
meeting, but the choice of members “‘was tabled”
till a later date.

The Bucknellian also reported that ‘‘The commit-
tee was boycotted by the Association of Blacks for
Progress because a similar committee, submitting

a report calling for recruitment and admission of
more blacks, was not considered because some felt
that its student membership was unrepresentative
of the community.”

The report concluded that “all present agreed
that the major aim of the committee should be
recruitment and admission of a more diverse stu-
dent body.”

According to the Nov. 4, 1969 Bucknellian,
students interested in the ‘‘Ad Hoc Committee for
studying the University’s resources for differently
prepared students, with special emphasis on the
black problem,” were asked to attend that even-
ing’s ABS meeting.

More than one year later, on Dec. 8, 1970, the ABS
endorsed a plan to increase the student activities
fee by $5 in order to fund a student scholarship for
“differently prepared”’ students.

Redirection of scholarship is discussed

From REDIRECTION, page 1.

fund of $15,000—-was originally
simply a “gesture of protest,”
designed to encourage ‘‘diversi-
ty’ here, but not necessarily
“minorities.” The scholarship
was originally worded as
directed for ‘‘differently
prepared” persons.

Associate Professor of English
Richard Smith, who was also in
attendance at the meeting, said
Suarez was playing a “‘linguistic
shell game” by asserting that
“diversity’’ did not imply the in-
clusion of black students, and
that ‘‘differently prepared” per-
sons were not minorities. He said
this interpretation of the original
interest of the scholarship was
“not accurate.”

Dean of Student Affairs John
Dunlop called it a “‘historic acci-
dent” that blacks came to be
identified as ‘‘differently
prepared” students.

The proposed redirection of the
ABS scholarship would result in
no change in the amount of aid
black students would receive,
and there would be ‘“‘no change
for anybody” as a result of the

redirection, according to Suarez.

He said aid to black students
was “already protected by the
University” and that it shouldn’t
be necessary for the ABS scholar-
ship to continue to encourage
minority enrollment. Suarez add-
ed that a redirection of the funds
would not hurt the black com-
munity, but would instead
specifically ‘foster leadership.”

The conditions of the revised
ABS scholarship—which was
unanimously endorsed by the
ABS Congress March 10—calls
for the student to exhibit genuine
“financial need” and also the
‘potential’? for leadership,
Suarez said. It does not make any
further restrictions on its rece-
pients, nor does it give
preference to students in any
other categories, he added.

Smith said it was ‘‘un-
fortunate” the ABS had taken
this position “given the current
mood of the country.”

Visiting Instructor of Political
Science Linda Thomas, who at-
tended the meeting as an
“interested party,’ questioned
what the ABS thought it could do

to promote leadership that the
University was not already do-
ing. She said ‘‘leadership
qualities” are not something that
can be promoted.

‘What if someone has not been
a leader but can be one in the
future?” she said.

The University is already pro-
moting leaders by ‘admitting
people with leadership ability,”
according to Admissions
Counselor and minority recruiter
Zanthia Conway. She said at the
meeting that the redirection of
the scholarship by the ABS is pro-
ving to divide the community.

Suarez said the ABS Congress
had no “deleterious intentions”
in passing its proposal to redirect
the scholarship funds. He said the
proposal could be rewritten, and
that he ‘‘apologizes to anyone in
the community we offended.”
Suarez stressed that the inten-
tions of the congress were
benevolent.

BSA president Kevon Makell
81 said he and said he and other
Alliance members would be pre-
sent at Monday’s ABS meeting to
voice their opinions during the
discussion of the scholarship.

Suarez and the other Steering
Committee members will discuss
the provisions of the scholarship
proposal with the BSA prior to the
ABS meeting Monday. Suarez
said he plans “to receive input in
the future” from groups prior to
voting on proposals which could
affect them. He said this is part of
an effort to make the intents of
the Congress ‘‘known and clear.”

Reagan reconsiders

Argentina embargo

President Reagan is consider-

Reagan met with president -

Ertel sponsors bill
to aid TMI cleanup

In an effort to speed the
massive cleanup job at the crippl-
ed Three Mile Island nuclear
power plant, Rep. Allen Ertel has
sponsored a bill that would derive
payment from the nuclear in-

dustry itself and not the tax-
payers.

The bill calls for $525 million of
the estimated $1 billion cleanup
fee to be paid by the nuclear in-
dustry, $300 million would be pro-
vided by insurance in existence
on the TMI plant and $175 million
would be funded by all users of
nuclear powered electricity.

Approximately 700,000 gallons
of radioactive water remains in
the TMI-2 reactor and cleanup is
expected to take between five and
nine years to complete.

Ertel is the representative in

EDITORIALS

Figures of speech

The perceptions of the college journalist is an unfortunately two-
sided one. When the news in our limited field of vision is less than
what some think — or perhaps hope — is scintillating — we are told
our reporting is as ‘‘exciting as a mortician’s speech.’’ But when a
flame of controversy — even a flicker, actually — is lit, we are con-
demned for sensationalizing and even editorializing the news.

Look under your Time and New York Times to find last week’s
Bucknellian; it’s a prime example. Stories dealing with such sen-
sitive issues as the impending dismissal of one of the University’s
top administrators and a potential shift in scholarship monies away
from the purses of minorities were covered without a pause. But
within hours of the news’ arriving in the University Center, the cam-
pus press was called to task for presenting truths far deeper than
those which appear in our ‘“‘Coming Events” column on page two.

Despite the nervous pondering of the campus politicians and the
shrouding of the administration’s actions behind a wall of at least
“off-the-record’’ secrecy, reevaluations of actions taken by both the
president of the ABS and the president of the University were taking
place. By today, progress has been made (and once again reported)
on both the ABS Scholarship story and the John Ferguson resigna-
tion story — two issues that effect all readers and their educations.

Are these the sequences of events readers consider dry and
about which the Bucknellian is usually recalcitrant? We certainly
don’t think so.

Finally

It’s a good feeling to know that — after nearly four months of
waiting and wishing — the Bucknell Recycling Club will finally be
getting back the money owed them by Charles Coder.

The principal of a student organization having free and
unobstructed access to its own financial principal is one too great to
let slip through the fingers of bureaucratic stalling. But, hard as
John Dunlop and one or two others have been trying since the fall to
reach yesterday’s conclusion, their attempts have been foiled by a
much larger number — the membership of the Complimentary Ac-
tivities Committee.

Too bad; they should have jumped 18 weeks ago to get Bob Doms
and Co. their restitution.

Minor matters?

It used to be that all students unquestioningly picked their
favorite subject as their major halfway through their college career
and that was that. But that — as the song goes — ‘‘was a long, long
time ago.” The double-major evolved for those who couldn’t decide
between neutrons and Nitzsche; then came the interdepartmental
major for those torn between and among a number of departments,
and then emerged the college major for those who couldn’t decide at
all.

This curricular option evolution shifted into a minor gear Thurs-
day when the College of Arts and Sciences passed a proposal calling
for departmental minors. While at first blush this sounds like a fine
idea, we wondered after a fashion if it is really necessary.

The ability to pursue a minor could encourage a better balance
for a student like the one alluded to above — the type that is pre-
professional but still harbors a yen for the liberal arts. This option
could allow them just the flexibility their intellects need to achieve
true command of their academic potential.

But while looking at this new program might lead us to believe it
could have nothing but beneficial effects on the student body of the
college, perhaps we might observe that these minors might also be
seen as placebos. Nothing now prohibits students from taking as
many courses as they like outside their major. What, then, is the
term minor other than another line on the transcript — a handy and
perhaps impressive label to be tacked on the resume.

We can only hope the benevolent intentions of the sponsors of the
college’s plan are more on the minds of the students than the all-too
often panic at the thought of completing that resume.

ABS scholarships need not exclude minorities

To the Editor:

It appears that some clarification concerning the
ABS scholarship is in order. As described in the
Bucknellian article and editorial of last week, the
Congress redirected scholarship funds from minori-
leaders, an act the
Bucknellian condemns as demonstrating ‘‘the in-
ferior quality of student leaders already attending

ty students to potential

the University.”

I must admit, I have difficulty with this logic.
Before the ABS actively investigated the scholar-
ship fund, few Bucknellians were even aware of its
existence. I would wager that this majority included

To the Editor:

I am writing in response to a
letter appearing in last week’s
Bucknellian in which a biology
major, a physics major and a
chemical engineering major took
it upon themselves to become art
critics. If nothing else, this shows
great initiative and should be
commended.

Since there is no “right” or
“wrong” per se in the art world, I
cannot fault their opinions. Con-
versely, I cannot attempt to
apologize for Diane Stiglich hav-
ing ruffled their obviously
bourgeois sensibilities with her
“polluted” art.

However, I do fault them for
having offered a totally un-
substantiated value judgment in

This is not a grievance letter. It is a letter expressing four years
of discontent with the discrepancies in articles on black issues.

In the last issue of the Bucknellian there was an article discuss-
ing the ABS’ redirection of scholarships to leaders instead of to
minorities. The statement implied that minority students are not
leaders. This accusation stems from blatant racism which sup-
posedly does not exist at the University.

Of course, the president of the ABS will respond: “there is a
misunderstanding.” I am tired of misunderstandings.

The Catechist: enlightening the studen

To the Editor:

After reading it, I feel I must protest the
Bucknell Progressive Caucus’ new paper,
The Catechist. I don’t deny Bucknell students
are largely unaware of the world situation.
However, The Catechist, instead of trying to
enlighten the student body, shoves highly
opinionated propaganda at it.

The Catechist admits to being opinionated,
but claims it’s also informative. When
something wants to really inform however, it
presents both sides of an issue instead, The
Catechist throws us one-sided information,

against the ABS. Weiland was nearly ac-

Florida: just skin off your back |

By Todd G. Buchholz

Have you Florida-bound vaca-
tioning Bucknellians started
packing yet? Before folding the
last pair of socks and looking for
‘the blow-dryer, maybe you
should reconsider. After all,
there must be at least 10 reasons
not to visit Florida.

Non-vacationers, you too can
read these; maybe they will
make you feel better about stay-
ing in Yankee country:

(1). It always rains when Nor-
therners go South. This maxim is
as reliable as a cafeteria line at
lunch. Ask anybody who has been
to Florida. You can listen to the
forecasts every hour on the radio,
but no matter what Com-
puweather says, when you visit,
the clouds will burst! Sorry, but
an umbrella is as basic to a
visitor as a calculator is to an
engineer.

(2). The sun will shine and bake
you like a casserole in a
microwave oven, despite the
precautions and the Sea & Ski
commercials. And you’ll be so
repulsed by peeling skin and raw
pink flesh that turtlenecks and
long sleeves will be stylish for
spring formals this year.

(3). There are just too many old
people in Florida. Every Nor-
theasterner who has retired in
the last 30 years has purchased a
condominium in Florida, most of
them across the street from
where you'll be staying in Ft.
Lauderdale. Not only that, they
control the police department

which loves to fine youngsters for
disturbing the peace. So
remember: lights out and stereos
off at 8:30 p.m. — you'll need lots
of sleep to be in shape for the
shuffleboard tournament at 8:30
the next morning.

(4). All those tacky college kids
from state schools will already be

STOP

there. Who wants to associate
with people who had low SAT
scores anyway?

(5). Like saccharine, red dye
#2, coffee and saliva, the good old
sun causes cancer in laboratory
rats who live in Canada, drink 800
bottles of diet soda daily and
work in nuclear plants. Everyone
knows we’re subjected to enough
gamma rays, X-rays,
microwaves and goodbye waves
already. You’re really asking for
trouble by sitting outside for a
week.

(6). Twenty-four hours in a car
is just absurd. Even the best
deodorants claim only 18 hours of
protection, and driving for that
long with the same people will

OPINIONS

bring forth the frightening con-
clusion that you’ve run out of
things to talk about after 20 years
of life. At least math majors and
engineers can do equations on the
way down, but the rest of you will
have to settle for “Turn up the
tunes, dudes.”’

(7). A quick three-hour plane
trip is equally as absurd. Any 5th
grade graduate will tell you plane
rides aren’t fun because you can’t
see any of the tourist sights. The
boring parts of the Carolinas and
Jimmy’s home state deserve
more attention than a wave from
30,000 feet; a trek down south is
wasteful without being stopped
by a speed trap in Plains, Ga.

(8). Sharon the cafeteria lady
claims Florida is just like Penn-
sylvania — once you’ve seen one
town you’ve seem them all. If you
can’t trust the lady who makes
the egg salad and who spent three
weeks there in January, who can
you trust?

(9). When you return, students
you’ve never seen before will ac-
cost you, stare at your charred
flesh, shake your shoulders and
ask that insipid question: “Where
have you been, Florida?”’
Avoiding this inquiry is worth
staying home, even if you live in
Hoboken.

(10). If any of these tragedies
should strike, I’ll have to devote
an entire column to “I told you
so.”

Racial tension and hysteria,

By Howard Manly
and Kevin A. Parker

ATLANTA — We remember 17 years
ago when Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
marched from Montgomery to Selma to
demonstrate his outrage over the bomb-
ings of Negro churches. We remember the
harassment of hate-filled policemen, the
unequal treatment of blacks in the courts
of law and the chills that spread through
our heads when we listened to him preach
about having a dream of freedom for all
oppressed people. And then he was shot.

In this city where he was buried, 20 black
children have been killed. The causes of
death varied: seven were by strangula-
tion, three by asphyxiation, six by undeter-
mined causes, two by beatings with an ob-
ject, one by a gunshot and one by stabbing.
Three more were reported missing this
past weekend.

OPINIONS

Friday, March 20, 1981

Two fathers of the victims have suffered
heart attacks; one mother has had a ner-
vous breakdown, and 15 siblings and four
mothers of the dead youths have been
under psychiatric care.

The children of Atlanta have been held
hostage by a killer without a face or a
name.

We walked in the ghettos here last
weekend in 70-degree weather looking for
little children playing in the streets. The
playgrounds and the streets were empty.
We looked further, and saw five little boys
and girls sitting on a front porch under the
careful watch of their guardian. The
children were greeted by two young boys,
both of whom were carrying pointed
stakes.

Later we heard on the radio that another
child was reported missing.

The body of the first child — 14-year-old

but no trace

Edward Smith — was found in July 1979.
Since then, millions of dollars have been
raised by the government, Sammy Davis,
Jr., Frank Sinatra and private donations
to help pay for the costly search for the
killer(s).

Without any concrete evidence, the
police and the public can only speculate
about the cause of the killings. Some say
it’s the Ku Klux Klan, some say it’s a con-
spiracy within the Atlanta police that
reaches to the White House, and some say
it’s the fault of the parents for living in
ghettos. All remain in the dark.

Speculation generates hysteria and
hysteria never solved any murders. What
is at the bottom of this tragedy is a failure
of our government to protect people from
being killed in the streets of American
cities.

Duckworth pieces
performed in N.Y.

The first New York per-
formance of Assistant Professor
of Music William Duckworth’s
“The Time Curve Preludes”
took place at the Roulette Club
Sunday.

Pianist Neely Bruce, a pro-
fessor of music at Wesleyan
University in Middletown,
Conn., was the evening’s per-
former. The first half of Bruce’s
program featured Duckworth’s
“preiudes,” while the second
half consisted of a short piece by
Bruce and a composition titled
“Winter Music” by John Cage.

Duckworth—who is on sab-
batical this year—composed
“The Time Curve Preludes” bet-
ween June 1977 and June 1978 on

a fellowship from the National
Endowment for the Arts.

Popular singer Pat Benatar performs in Ocean City,
Maryland last July. Benatar and Bob Dylan are currently
under consideration for concerts here.

BCC takes initial steps
to book Benatar, Dylan

By ALLISON ABOUCHAR

The Bucknell Concert Committee has recently approached Pat
Benatar and Bob Dylan with bids for concerts here, the Bucknellian
learned this week.

Because Benatar will be giving large concerts in Philadelphia
and Pittsburgh during her September tour and other schools may

be placing higher bids, Assistant Concert Committee Chairman
Rich Schaberg ’81 said the group is ‘not very hopeful” that Benatar
will accept the BCC’s offer of $30,500 for a one-night concert either
Sept. 9 or 16.

But Schaberg said he hopes the decision will be finalized
“before the end of the semester.”

A second bid — for a concert by Bob Dylan — has been approv-
ed-by University officials and is currently under consideration by

Monarch Entertainment, Dylan’s agent, Schaberg said. Dylan’s
plans for a tour may be cancelled, however, according to Schaberg.

Benatar, one of the hottest new artists this past year, has
released two albums. In The Heat of the Night was released in

September 1979 ad included the hit single “Heartbreaker.”’ Her
most recent album, released last year, was entitled Crimes of
Passion and included the popular ‘‘Hit Me With Your Best Shot.”

Dylan, a legend of the 1960s, has recently begun writing Chris-
tian music. His latest album, entitled Slow Train Coming, was
released in 1979.

Every concert considered by the Bucknell Concert Committee
must first be approved by the Steering Committee of the ABS and
members of the administration — including Vice President for Ad-
ministration and Finance John Zeller, Dean of Student Affairs John
Dunlop and Director of Student Activities and University Center
Programs James Hammerlee.

A bid is presented through an agency — in this case Monarch
Entertainment of West Orange, N.J. works for both artists — to the
artist, who then considers the offer in light of such factors as the
touring schedule and the size of the bid, Schaberg said.

‘Dance on Broadway’ company
is self-assured and professional

Perseverance and enthusiasm provide an enjoyable show

By LAURA CARMELICH

In the not-too-distant past, the Bucknell Dance
Company performed its semi-annual shows in the
Dance Studio of the Sports/Recreation Complex.
Though talented and enthusiastic, the dancers were
hindered by the studio’s unprofessional conditions
of noisy folding chairs and sharply-limited floor
space.

The company was determined to overcome these
hindrances, and their perseverance has paid off.

In a show entitled ‘‘Dance On Broadway,” the
Dance Company performed for an overflowing
crowd in Coleman Theatre Wednesday. Aside from
a few minor technical difficulties, the company was
at its very best: competent, self-assured and, at
last, professional.

The show consisted of 11 numbers, featuring
familiar musical pieces from such ballets and
shows as “Swan Lake” and ‘‘West Side Story.”

The opening number, choreographed to ‘The
Show Must Go On” by Three Dog Night, featured
four dancers in clown costumes. This number, suf-
fering from the different dancing styles of the four
members and their somewhat disjointed timing,
was an unfortunate choice for an opener.

The show was quickly revived, however, with a
beautiful ballet choreographed by Leslie Gallagher
81.

A “Pas de Deux”’ was performed nearly flawless-
ly by Gallagher and Ayumi Hashimoto ’81 to the
music of “Swan Lake.” In “Dance of the Little
Swans’’—another from ‘Swan Lake’”’—Alison Cor-
vington ’81 and Cynthia Karbowski 81 joined
Gallagher and Hashimoto in an impressively syn-
chronous ballet adapted by Corvington.

Also notable in the first half was a solo per-
formance by Charlotte Tsuyuki ’84 in “‘The Music,
The Mirror” from the Broadway hit, ‘‘A Chorus
Line.” Tsuyuki’s dancing is of an unusually rugged
nature which, complemented by her fitting facial
expressions, gave this number a realistic and ear-
thy quality.

Two numbers highlighted the superior second
half. The first was choreographed by Bucknell
dance instructor Joan Clark to the tune ‘‘On Broad-
way” by George Benson. In their first per-
formances of the evening, the dancing of
sophomores Marlene Rinder and Julie Scandura ex-
celled among the superior performances of the rest
of the company in this number.

The second highlight—and probably the most

popular number of the evening—was a tap dance
performed by Lisa Cinelli ’82 and Dwayne McAliley
"83.

To the upbeat tune of ‘‘It’s All For The Best” from
“Godspell,”’ the couple gave their professionally ar-
ranged dance a brilliantly executed performance.
Adding to the audience’s entertainment was the ob-
vious pleasure the two had in performing this
number. Their animated expressions and brisk
movements made this dance truly fun to watch.

The hard work and enthusiasm of the Bucknell
Dance Company have not gone unnoticed. The
dancers were unquestionably deserving of their
more respectable and wholly more elegant surroun-
dings. The members should be heartily applauded
for such an enjoyable evening.

$100,000 gift given for poet-in-residence program

By LYNNE RUTHERFORD
In one of the largest private gifts ever

donated in support of poetry, an
anonymous benefactor has given $100,000
to the University for the creation of a poet -
in - residence program.

University President Dennis O’Brien
made the announcement at Saturday even-
ing’s Association for the Arts Dinner in
Larison Dining Hall. The dinner
highlighted the final day of a week’s worth
of Celebration of the Arts events here.

As the new program presently stands, a
poet of ‘‘national stature”’ will come to the
campus for approximately six weeks of the
year, holding readings and conducting
workshops, seminars and classes. The
selection process is now being undertaken

for next year by a committee comprised of
faculty, administrators and alumni.

The residency will be funded annually
out of investment earnings from the gift.

In other banquet activities, Lecturer in
Music Robert Beckman and Edward
Davis, senior partner in Theatre Now, a
New York firm, were presented with
awards. Beckman was honored with the
“Contribution to Music’ .award for
countless years as a flutist in Cap and Dag-
ger pit orchestras. He is still active as a
part-time instructor here.

Davis, who retained his connections with
the University by sponsoring a January in-
ternship with his firm, was commended

for ‘contributions to the American

theater.”

Another star of the evening was un-
doubtedly Grace Good Hettinger, a 1917
graduate and the first woman in history
allowed to appear on stage in a Cap and
Dagger production.

Other speeches were kept short, but Het-
tinger — in her tribute to Cap and Dagger
— charmed the audience for 15 minutes
with tales of early University life and
theater.

When she had finished, Director of the
University Theater, Harvey Powers, step-
ped up to the microphone and said, “‘I was
going to tell you about Cap and Dagger,
but Grace covered it all.”

Associate Professor of English Ralph

Rees, Vice President of the Association for
the Arts and Chairman of the Celebration
’81 program committee, termed this past
week “the most successful Celebration
we’ve ever had.”

“About 50 percent of the audience during
the Rampal concert were students and 75
percent were students during the
Houseman lecture. That’s what’s most im-
portant — getting the students to come to
the events,” he said.

Next year’s Celebration of the Arts Week
will center on the University’s Chorale,
and its long-time director, Professor of
Music Allen Flock. A reunion of past and
present members of the organization is
scheduled to take place. zee

Tristram editors explain poetry and
prose selection to set record straight

By AMY KENNEDY

Tristram, Bucknell’s student literary and art
magazine, has often been called pseudo - intellec-
tual or esoteric. Co-editors Linda Wolff ’81 and
Howard Rubenstein ’81 feel such criticism j~ un-
founded, however, and this week made clea. the
magazine’s selection process in an effort to set the
record straight.

Each piece, Wolff says, is critically analyzed and
judged, not only for its potential quality, but also on
the skill of the winters within their chosen medium,
be it poetry or prose.

“We do not want to sacrifice quality just to get
sample selection of the submissions,’ Wolff said.
“We are only as good as what we print.”

Both editors said the limited number of prose,
poetry and artwork received for consideration is
directly related to the small number of creative
writing courses offered by Bucknell.

Simply put, the selection process runs something
like this: the literary editors read the works submit-
ted and place them on reserve in the Ellen Clarke

Bertrand Library, where any interested student
may review them. Staff members are required to
have read all the literature in order to participate in
the final selection.

This semester, the editors have added Anne McIn-
tyre 82 as assistant editor. Other department
editors include Debra Sauerland ’81, poetry; Ed-
ward Wise ’81, prose, and Derek Gibson ’82 and Bar-
bara Posner ’82, art. Lisa DiNicola ’81 serves as
business manager.

As the publication is dependent solely on its ap-
propriations, the Tristram staff works closely with
the ABS. The Mifflinburg Telegraph Co. publishes
1500 copies of the magazine each semester which
are distributed free of charge to the University com-
munity.

Tristram will be sponsoring a student art show
later this spring in association with Hulley House,
as well as the traditional post-publication poetry
reading. The Alice J. Russo Memorial Prize of $50
will be awarded to the best poem appearing in this
spring’s issue.

Theater's history and future discussed by Houseman

By BRUCE BOWEN

One of the final events of this year’s
Celebration of the Arts was a tribute to the
80th anniversary of Cap and Dagger,
spearheaded by a lecture by John
Houseman.

During his introduction of Houseman,
Associate Professor of English Ralph Rees
told the Rooke Chapel audience of almost
850 that in honor of Cap and Dagger, the
coordinators had looked for the ‘‘best
available actor’? to start the birthday
celebration. Many would not dispute that
Houseman is indeed “the best in American
theater,” Rees said.

Houseman’s slow, deliberate stroll to the
podium sparked memories in a good por-

tion of the crowd of his famous per--

formance as Professor Kingsfield in the
movie, ‘‘The Paper Chase.”

Clad in a grey suit and his traditional bow
tie, Houseman charmed the audience
from the start with a combination of
serious and humorous anecdotes.

Houseman’s lecture — entitled ‘My
Seven Theaters’ — embodied his view of
the history and the future of the theater,
especially in America. He said Americans
tend to regard the theater as ‘‘entertaining
and relaxing,’ rather than in a more
serious light.

However, he spoke rather highly of
Americaff theater, which he said has its
own special style.

Calling the theater ‘‘the highest form of
human culture,” Houseman expressed
concern about the future of theater and the
threat of movies and television, but he con-
tended that there is “no substitute for liv-
ing theater.”

“In the past one could at most see one
play every two or three weeks. Now, we
can watch almost anything anytime we
like,” Houseman said.

He continued that television’s biggest
fault is that quality has become secondary
to popularity. His television series ‘The
Paper Chase”’ is a perfect example of this
because ratings killed it, according to
Houseman.

“The Paper Chase’ was taken off the air

because only 18 million people watched it
instead of 30 million. Quality had nothing
to do with it,” he said.

The results of this trend, he continued,
are ‘‘very nefarious and dangerous,” as
they lead to ‘‘total confusion between
quality and quantity.” He continued that
this problem has “permeated all of socie-
ty,” including publishers and museums.

“There is a terribly irresistible urge to
follow the winner,’’ Houseman said.

Houseman said that proof quality is still
important may be found in regional
theater. “Regional theater is exempt
simply because it cannot exploit the
numbers game,’’ Houseman said.

It was another birthday party — like the ones we gave
and attended countless times as children — where the
frosting was far more memorable than the cake.

For the 80th anniversary of Cap and Dagger, the
Association for the Arts, the Office of Alumni Relations and
the organization’s alumni and present entourage all con-
spired to create a celebration to make this year’s Celebra-
tion (of the Arts) a memorable and commemorative one.
But the official main event of the weekend, the Cap and
Dagger stating of Thornton Wilder’s “Our Town,” was in
the end a stale and dry version of the already spartan
American classic — especially when held up to the moun-

tains of other theater events which

three day run.

“topped off” the play’s

Unfortunately for Director Allen Haines ’81, he was
given the dubious honor (some would say challenge) of
creating in a month a play worthy of an audience of special

listlessness probably could have been greatly aleviated had
Haines not also been given the Herculean task of drawing
dramatic water from a literary stone in the scant four
week’s rehearsal time.

“Qur Town” is a difficult play to produce successfully
even under ideal logistical circumstances. As a drama that
banks on its ability to bore the audience — and thereby lull
them into an eventual realization that the most mundane
aspects of human experiences are worth cherishing —
every innocuous gesture and every throw away line must be
milked for all its simplistic subtlety.

It is here that our version of the play failed under the
deadline pressure. For example, Barry Fishel ’81 seemed
to have been unable to decide whether to play the part of
stage manager as insider or outsider. In alternating from
compassionate puppeteer to cynical observer, Fishel took
two interpretations of the character that each could have
worked well, and muddled them into an incohesive whole.

Patrick Pedro ’81 gives the play’s best supporting per-
formance, captivating us with the honesty and naivete of
the editor Webb in his interview with Fishel and the au-
dience.

What miracles Haines could not do with his actors he
appeared to have worked with his technical crew. The sim-
ple lights of David Polsky ’81 and the simpler set design of
special student Deborah Slade proved fine vehicles for the
director’s blocking, especially in the final and most pro-
vocative act. 3

Too bad Thornton Wilder (and the Cap and Dagger play
selection committee) didn’t pick simpler emotions to block
out on the “birthday party” set.

Powers is roasted during
Cap and Dagger reunion

By LYNNE RUTHERFORD

Professor of English and
Director of the University
Theatre Harvey Powers — for 32
years the guiding force of Cap
and Dagger — may have gotten
more than he bargained for dur-
ing Saturday night’s big reunion
in Coleman Hall.

After the evening’s per-
formance of ‘Our Town,” more
than 150 past and present Cap and
Dagger members gathered
onstage to celebrate the
organization’s 80th anniversary.
‘After “Our Town” Director Allen
Haines ’81 and Stage Manager
Bruce Delaplane ’82 wheeled out
a giant birthday cake, 11 of
Powers’ students took the stage

he presented Powers with a
plaque inscribed ‘‘for 32 faithful
years of histrionics.”’

Also in recognition of Powers’
32 years of service, University
President Dennis O’Brien an-
nounced at the Association for the
Arts dinner that a bronze plaque
will be placed at the entrance of
Coleman Theatre commending
Powers.

But as if the standing ovations
following this announcement
were not enough, Powers was
also presented with a silver bowl
from the Association of the Arts
at the dinner. This bowl was in
recognition of Powers’ lasting
contributions to the theater at
Bucknell.

Spring sports teams face opening day with optimism

By Jeff Cross

Like Grand Central Station at
rush hour, Davis Gymnasium and
the adjoining Sports/Recreation
Complex have been packed with
athletes preparing for the start of
the spring season.

Though the competition comes
on strong beginning next week,
this month’s unseasonably and
consistently cold weather has left
the outdoor fields all but
unplayable. Indoor workouts have
been the rule for all but two of the
University’s nine springtime var-
sities. These two, lacrosse and
baseball, are profiled on the back
page.

The rest—some coming off win-
ning 1980s, others hoping to re-
bound from losing records—look
to this season with an unbounded
optimism.

Men’s Tennis

“Overall there are some good signs.”

These words come from men’s tennis
coach Craig Reynolds, whose netters are
coming off a third-place finish in the ECC
championships after a 5-9 dual match
record in 1980.

Despite losing two of the starting six
singles performers, Reynolds predicts, his
team ‘“‘should be able to maintain close to
the same finish.”’

Taking over the first singles position will
be sophomore Steve Haas, who was 8-5 at
fourth singles and finished second at that
position in the ECC championships last
year. With the “challenging” 20-match
schedule, Haas “will have to play very
well to have close to a .500 record,”
Reynolds said.

Juniors Bill Beneke and Eric Simpson
and senior Paul Adkins are slated for the
second through fourth singles slots,
respectively, with Mark Greenawald ’83
tentatively in the fifth spot. Freshman
Mike Driscoll — as well as sophomores
Simon Hail and Andy Walker — will join
Greenawald in competing for the fifth and
sixth singles positions.

Doubles combinations will be Haas and
Greenawald at number one, Beneke and
Simpson at two and Adkins and Driscoll at
three.

The team’s strength “‘lies in our balance
and depth. Our players don’t vary that
much from (positions) one to six,” ac-
cording to Reynolds. The key to success
throughout the season will be ‘‘winning
consistently from number three on down,”
Reynolds said. He cautioned, ‘What we
need is a little seasoning’’ for a winning
campaign.

Women’s Tennis

“This is the best team we’ve had yet,
and the others weren’t shabby” is
women’s tennis coach Rose Ewan’s
description of her squad.

Ewan can back up her lofty remarks
with a quick check of the record of the fall
1980 edition of her team, a squad that went
6-1. However, “the spring schedule is a lot
tougher than the fall schedule” Ewan said,
warning against over-optimism.

Among their 13-game slate—that opens
Tuesday with a home match against
Susquehanna—are four Division I schools
and some top Division II competition.
Ewan noted, ‘‘Our problem will be to stay
tough in the big points. We’re going to have
to dig deep within ourselves to come up
with the big points.”

Leading the way for the Bisons will be

Patty Koch ’83 and Sarah Krieger ’82 who
“give us a nice combination” at first and
second singles, according to Ewan. Koch
had a 5-2 individual record in the fall and
Krieger was 6-1 at second singles.

In the third spot will be senior co-captain
Kirsten Schaubauer (3-3 in the fall) while
Cindy Appel ’83 (5-2) holds down the fourth
singles position. Senior co-captain Janis
Huber (5-2) and freshman Laura
Kirschsten (4-2) play in the fifth and sixth
positions, respectively.

The doubles tandems Will be Krieger and
Shuber, Koch and Appel and Schubauer
with Kirschstein. “‘Doubles competition is
our strength,’ Ewan remarked, citing as
evidence the doubles team’s combined
20-1 record last fall.

With no organized ECC championship
for women’s tennis as yet, Ewan would
“like to get a bid to the Easterns
(EAIAWs).” The coach cites as keys to an
invitation ‘defeating rivals Lehigh and
Lafayette or being within one point’’ and
compiling ‘‘a 4-3 record”’ in the seven dual
matches exclusive of a six match Southern
tour scheduled during Spring Break.

Softball

With eight of nine starters returning, the
softball team has high aspirations for an
improvement over last season’s 7-8 mark.

Coach Terrie Grieb hopes her charges
can pick up right where they left off last
spring, when the Bisons capped a three
game winning streak with a season-ending
14-0 whitewashing of Mansfield State.

Missing from the starting nine will be
Betsy Doyle ’83 — the team leader in bat-
ting (.455) and RBI’s (15) — who is in Lon-
don for the semester. However, six
starters return who hit above .300 a year
ago.

The pitching staff that ‘‘will be better
than last year’? — according to Grieb —
boasts two of the best hitters on the squad.
Junior Dawn Straub hit .364 with 12 RBI’s
and posted a 5-2 record on the mound and
sophomore Denise Cohen hit .349 and
scored 18 runs. Cindy Connelly ’84 is the
third starter while the chief reliever will
be Jill Henry ’81.

The starting infield has senior captain
Patty Inchalik (.323 last year) at first
base, junior Ali Brown (.220) at second,
sophomore Jackie Crump (.394) at third)
and sophomore Linda Palm (.384) at short-
stop.

Starting behind the plate will be
Stephanie Buck ’82, second on the team in
hitting (.444) and first in runs scored (21) a
year ago.

Opening day outfielders will be Kaye
Swartz ’82 in left field, either Cohen or
Straub in center field when not pitching
and Meg Giansello ’84 in right field.

The Bisons open their 14-game schedule
with a first-ever encounter with Wilkes
Tuesday in Scranton. Grieb predicts,
“we'll be pretty good defensively; I’m not
sure offensively.”

Unable to practice outside yet, Grieb
said, ‘‘We’re still working on fundamen-
tals.”” Nevertheless, she predicts the team
will ‘‘have much more depth and more
pitching than last year.”

Women’s Track

With its season opener not until April 12,
the women’s track team still has time to
relish its outstanding indoor season and
prepare for the outdoor campaign.

Eight returning women who hold 17
school records outdoors will lead the
Bisons into their opener against Lock
Haven, 84-34 losers to Bucknell a year ago.
In addition, the track team broke eight in-
door school records on its way to a seventh
place finish at the EAIAW championships

in Boston March 7-8.

The outdoor trackwomen ran up a 5-1
dual meet record last year, placed first
among 10 teams in the Binghamton
(N.Y.) Invitational and finished second of
eight squads in the Hartwick (N.Y.) In-
vitational.

The Bisons have strength in the hurdles,
sprints, middle distances and field events,
with school record holders returning in
each category.

Lonnie Fertik ’83 — holder of school
marks in the 100-meter and 110-yard
hurdles, long jump, high jump and pen-
tathlon — will again score heavily for
Coach Diane Ware’s trackwomen. “‘We’re
really looking forward to the outdoor
season. ‘‘There’s lots of improvement to be
made,” Fertik said.

Middle-distance record-holder Jo Bur-
rell ’83 (mile) joins junior co-captains
Suzanne Hecker (200-meters, 220-yards)
and Linda Accettura (400-meters, 440-
yards) in the longer sprints to give
Bucknell experience in track events.

Sophomore Beth Bittel holds school
records in the shot put, discus and javelin
to lead the field events.

Laurie Van Wyck ’83 holds school
records in the 400-meter and 440-yard
hurdles and is a standout in relays as well.

The most promising newcomer for the
outdoor season is freshman sensation Nan-
cy Russo, who established school records
in the long jump, 55-meter dash and 300-
meters in the EAIAW indoor champion-
ships.

Men’s Track

With a first place finish in the East Coast

Conference cross country championships
and a third in the ECC indoor track meet
already under his belt this year, Coach Art
Gulden looks confidently toward similar
success from his men’s outdoor track
squad. ‘‘We may not be the favorite (for
the ECC outdoor crown) but we’re sure as
heck capable of winning it.”

The Bisons were favored for the indoor ti-
tle, but came up short in finishing a disap-
pointing third behind Temple and St.
Joseph’s. Gulden remarked, ‘“‘We were
definitely overconfident. If we correct that
deficiency outdoors, we’ll be right in the
pack.”

Last year, the trackmen were undefeated
in five dual meets and triumphed over 11
teams in the Hartwick (N.Y.) Invitational
before being outdistanced by Delaware,
125-100, in the ECC championships. This
spring, Gulden predicts, “‘If we realize our
potential in every event, we can win the
meet.”

A ‘‘well rounded team’’ with
“possibilities in every event’”’ will be the
key to dethroning the two-time defending
champion Blue Hens at the ECC cham-
pionships, according to the Bucknell men-
tor.

The Bisons — strong once again in the
distance events — have improved con-
siderably in the field, weight and sprints
events.

Sophomores Ted Lewis (high jump and
long jump) and Jamie Dodd (pole vault) in
the field events, juniors Mike Ward (shot
put) and Jim Passannante (weight throw)
in the weight events and junior Martin
Carter in the sprints are expected to carry
over their indoor success to shine in the
outdoor campaign.

In addition, the ‘‘experience gained by
our young competitors indoors’ should
propel many other new faces into the win-
hers’ circle.

Gulden mentioned Temple, St. Joe’s
(both conquerors of Bucknell indoors this
winter) and Delaware as the Bisons’ main
competition in the conference. However,
he concludes, “If we score in every event, I
don’t think anyone can beat us.”

Golf

With a little help from Mother Nature,
the men’s golf team will tee off its season
against Susquehanna Tuesday on the
University’s golf course.

Coach Jeff Ranck’s linksmen are out to
top their third-place finish in the ECAC
Southern Sectional Tournament last fall
and fourth-place finish in the ECC last
spring.

The loss of Dave Richards, who
graduated in December, will not help the
Bisons’ cause. Richards led the golfers the
last two years, ending his Bucknell career
with a second place finish in the ECAC
finals last spring.

Enough talent remains, though, that the
Bisons should ‘“‘probably go about 6-1 or 5-
2, maybe even 7-0 if we get lucky” in dual
matches, according to Ranck. However,
“That is not the important thing to me. I
want us to improve in each tournament.”

“A realistic goal would be to finish se-
cond to Temple in the ECC,” Ranck said.
“Tt would be practically a miracle to beat
Temple, but we might be able to surprise
them.’’ He added, ‘‘The same type of finish
in the ECAC would also be realistic. A win
in one or the other (ECCs or ECACs) would
be great. That would get us into the
NCAAs.”

Leading the five returning lettermen are
Rob Wagner ’81 and Rick Kramer ’83. ‘In
the absence of Richards, it may be man-
datory to get those kinds of performances
(like Richards’) out of both of them,”
Ranck said.

The remaining starters are likely to be
sophomore Bill Francis and juniors Jeff
Buley and Mike Stoyla. Francis ‘can be
counted on to be a consistent contributor’
and Buley has “‘lots of potential or talent at
times,’’ according to Ranck. Stoyla “‘has
been on the brink of playing some great
golf for us for the past two years,” he add-
ed.

Kevin High ’82, John Stasko ’83 and Peter
Orr ’84 “have the potential to become
starters for us,”’ Ranck concluded.

Women’s Lacrosse

In only its third year of varsity competi-
tion, the women’s lacrosse team enters an
expanded 12-game schedule with a high
degree of anticipation.

Coach Sally Starr is optimistic. ‘‘We’re
ahead of ourselves as far as last season”
when the Bisons were outscored 74-41 and
had a 2-5 record. ‘‘We should be in every
game,” she said.

For an improved record, the team
“must execute better and cut down on er-
rors,”’ according to Starr. ‘‘Last year we
made a lot of unforced errors as a result of
inexperience.”

The Bisons open against Lehigh Thurs-
day on the West fields. ‘That game will
show how far we’ve come. Last year, we
weren’t ready for them (losing 13-3) and
that was at the end of the year,” Starr
notes.

Leading the offense against the
Engineers will be attackers Anne Kennedy
’82 and Ellen McCahon ’81. Kennedy has
led the squad in scoring the past two years
with 23 and 12 goals in 1979 and 1980. Mc-
Cahon was second a year ago with 11 goals.

Starr sees improvement in the defense
as well—with Liz Rabenold ’81 the stand-
out. Rabenold is “‘pivotal on defense”’ said
her coach.

The graduation of Kathy Kline leaves a
large gap to fill in the nets. Kline made 112
saves for a .602 save percentage as
goaltender last year. Her replacement has
not been decided as yet, according to
Starr.

The squad is anxious to begin play out-
side because, “They sense that it could be
a banner year — with a lot of hard work,”
Starr concluded.

Frazier leads women’s swimming to 19th in nation

By ROBERT BURNEY

“We didn’t expect to do so well,” beamed junior Bitser
Dexter, in an understated appraisal of her team’s per-
formance at the AIAW Division I] Swimming Champion-
ships, held last Thursday through Saturday at Northern
Michigan University in Marquette, Mich.

The Bison swimmers, 20th place finishers in last year’s
AIAWS, smashed seven Bucknell records en route to a
nineteenth place finish with 98.5 points. Clarion State cap-
tured the championship with 439 points.

Bison standout Kathy Frazier ’82 established four of the
all-time marks. In the 100-yard butterfly, Frazier broke
her old record of 59.37 seconds by .72 in the trials. It was
not a record to stand long, however, as she shattered it
once again in the championship with a time of 58.43, good
enough for 4th place. Friday the 13th proved no nemesis,
as she eclipsed her own Bucknell record of 2:10.95, clock-
ing 2:10.92 in the trials of the 200-yard butterfly.

In the finals, Frazier finished seventh in 2:12.09.

A fourth place finish in the 50-yard freestyle provided
Frazier with her third Bucknell record of the competition,
with a time of 26.94. Finally, she took 23 seconds off her
record in the 50-yard freestyle, picking up eighth place in
25.30.

Dexter, for her part, set new school records in the 100-
yard breaststroke and 200-yard breaststroke. In the 100,
she broke the 1:10.89 mark she had set herself with a
1:10.75 13th place finish. In the 200 Dexter topped the
previous Bucknell best with a time of 2:33.63 in the trials,
surpassing it again in the finals — clocking 2:33.53 — as
she garnered 14th place.

One other school record has eclipsed by freshman Lisa
Desrochers in Thursday’s 200-yard backstroke finals.
Desrochers owned the record going into Marquette, then
shaved 1.07 seconds off it in the trials with her time of
2:14.19. She improved upon it again in the finals, captur-

ing 12th place in 2:14.12.

In all, Frazier finished in the top eight in five events, the
100-yard freestyle being the only one in which she didn’t
set a new record. As the first eight in each event earn
AIAW All-American status, Frazier qualified in these
events plus two relays, for a total of seven All-American
events. Her career total is now 16 All-American events.

She attributed her performance, like that of the team as
a whole, to being “rested, tapered, and ready.” It was
“better individual performances, rather than anything
mechanical that did it for us,” she said.

Dexter and Desrochers in their individual events — plus
Karen Young ’83 in a relay — also became All-Americans.

Coach Joel Feldman said she was ‘“‘ecstatic’’ about the
team’s performance. Noting that the competition included
the top 64 AIAW teams, Dexter said, ‘‘We did pretty well
with the tough competition.”

Berger stands out in goal
in sloppily played game

By KEN QUAAS

A pesky Franklin & Marshall offense
gave Coach Sid Jamieson’s laxmen a scare
before falling to the Bisons in the final
minutes of a chilly season opener Wednes-
day.

F&M brought a team to Lewisburg that
dropped a 10-5 decision to Bucknell last
year but froze the laxmen in a series of
deadlocks which made the game more dif-
ficult for the Bisons than it should have
been.

Sam Vail started the scoring for F&M in
the first period — setting off a series of
game-long exchanges between the two
teams. Rink Smith ’83 put the Bisons on the
scoreboard minutes later after a final pass
from senior tri-captain Jim Gilbert. The
first period ended in a tie after Vail and tri-
captain John Morris ’82 exchanged tallies.

The second quarter was marked by slop-
py ball handling — which punctuated the
entire game—and much end-to-end play.
Following an F&M time out, mid-
fielder Rodney Brown ’83 stunned the
Diplomats with a quick, unassisted goal,
but F&M came charging back and tied the
score at three, less than two minutes later

The action intensified in the third quarter
when Mike Poldino put the Diplomats

ahead, 4-3. Not to be denied, Brown and
George Cusick ’83 pelted F&M’s rather in-
effective goalie and scored on identical
unassisted plays one minute apart.

Rob Mathai ’82 put the Bisons ahead to

pass from Smith and shooting, all in one
motion, and the pretty play put the icing on
the cake for the laxmen, 7-5.

Jamieson said he ‘didn’t know what to
expect” in the opener and is concerned
about the Bisons’ lack of offensive power.
“It’s going to take some time for us to get
settled on attack,” Jamieson said. “We
didn’t play well against F&M.”

Senior tri-captain Stu Berger agreed with
the coach’s assessment of the Bisons’ level
of play. ‘We had to work out the pre-game
jitters,” he said. “I was frustrated
because I thought we should have blown
them out.”

While Jamieson said the midfield and at-
tack ‘‘need help,” he was quick to compli-
ment the play of the young defense — an-
chored by Gilbert — which features
sophomore Mike Frahlich, who saw little
playing time last season but has “mprov-
ed 100 percent,” and freshman Geoff Chen-
worth.

“F&M is a cutting and feeding team and
we shut them down to five goals. Our
defense dominated the attack,” the coach
said.

Jamieson said he was especially pleased
with the play of All-East Coast Conference
goalie Berger, who turned in an “‘outstan-
ding performance.’’ Berger recorded 12
saves — eight in the second half — and

win, while John Morris ‘82 and Rodney Brown ‘83 scored

stalled the pressing Diplomat offense with
his steady net tending. ‘‘We count on Stu to
make some super plays. He has to for us to
be successful,” Jamieson said.

Bucknell faces some brutal competition
in coming weeks. The Bisons next compete
in the Loyola Tournament in Baltimore
March 28-29, and will prepare for peren-
nial power Maryland, currently ranked
sixth in the nation (Division I). Opponents
Syracuse (ranked third nationally and the
team which had the “best recruiting
year,” according to Jamieson), Rutgers,
fifth-ranked, and no. 15 Army round out a
rocky regular season for the laxmen.

“We're not as strong as we have been,”
conceded Jamieson, “but we’ll gain con-
fidence as the season progresses. The
F&M win will help.”

Jamieson said the primary aim of the
team is success in the ECC. He cited
Delaware as an “excellent” team and said
the Blue Hens are the “number-one pick”
in the conference. Defending ECC Cham-
pions Delaware nipped the Bisons 12-11
last season, and have beaten the laxmen
three years straight by a single goal.

Berger agreed with the coach about the
prevalent desire to bag the Hens. “No
question about it. If I had to win one game,
it would be Delaware. We haven’t beaten
them since I’ve been here, and they’re the
ones we want.”

‘Play ball’will sound Tuesday;

hardballers seek revitalization

By KAREN TARNOW
With an experienced nucleus of players from last
year and a strong group of freshmen coming up, the
varsity baseball team looks for improvement over
last year’s 3-17 record.

Coach Tommy Thompson — having been with the
team only two weeks since the end of basketball
season — is looking forward to getting outside with
the team for some real practicing. ‘They have been
working hard (indoors),” Thompson said. “I’m en-
thused and optimistic about this season.”

For the first time, the Bisons had fall workouts to
cut down the number of players so that spring prac-
tices could be better organized with more time for
individual work. This enabled the players to become
“a closer - knit team,” according to Thompson.

The starting lineup shows some defensive
changes, with Jim Cawley ’82 moving from second
base to shortstop, Jim Eick ’82 from shortstop to left
field and senior captain Bill Lawrence from third to
first base. Cawley (.342) and Lawrence (.320) were
the top batters on the team last year.

The rest of the lineup includes senior Scott Dow —

who hit .303 last year — returning at catcher,
sophomore Paul Bamford in center field, freshman
Brian Bastecki in right field and senior George
Kangos at second base. Third base is still undecided
with sophomores Jim Frantz and Doug Clark and
freshman Larry Daniel competing for the hot cor-
ner.

Last season, the pitching staff was overworked
due to a busy schedule because of rain outs. They
surrendered 7.07 runs per game. This year’s staff,
while young and relatively inexperienced, has much
more depth, according to Thompson.

Ken Durr ’82, who was credited with all three wins
last year, Tom Ganter ’81 and freshmen Mark Glatz
and Jim Smith, will comprise the starting rotation.
Ed Hughes ’83, quarterback for the football team,
has made the transition from spring football to
baseball this year to join the mound staff.

The 27-game season looks challenging but Thomp-
son hopes to start off the season with a few wins so
that the team can gain confidence.

The Bisons open against F&M at 3 p.m. Tuesday

Required writing courses

to be voted on by faculty

The University Committee on Instruction voted unanimously
March 24 to approve its revised proposal on student writing, which
would require students to take three writing courses in order to
graduate.

The proposal will be presented to the University faculty for a vote
April 20 during a special meeting requested by Committee Chairman
Joseph LaBarge.

A subcommittee conducted a survey of the faculty concerning stu-
dent writing abilities in March 1980 and submitted a report in
September which said that many students lack necessary writing
skills. The writing proposal was developed as a result of the commit-
tee’s recognition of the need to improve students’ writing capabilities.

The proposed writing courses are divided into three categories
and students will be required to pass one course in each category, ac-
cording to the proposal.

Although the Committee on Instruction unanimously approved the
proposal, Acting English Department Chairman Dennis Baumwoll
said the department “‘is deeply divided over the proposal. There isa
large number of members who do not support it.”

‘Baumwoll said the proposal is “riddled with ambiguities and is so

AGrand Dragon of the Ku Klux
Klan early this morning can-
celled a scheduled recruiting
drive in Lewisburg this weekend
when he learned that the Klan’s
appearance here would coincide
with the ninth annual Black Arts
Festival.

Citing what he said were the
Klan’s interests in “fighting for
equal rights for all mankind
regardless of color and creed,”
Grand Dragon Jim Locke said
the Klan’s leadership determined
it would be best not to appear at
this time so that the ‘“‘special pro-
gram for black students could oc-
cur successfully and without inci-
dent.”

In an exclusive interview with
the Bucknellian, Locke—the
highest ranking officer of the In-
visible Empire of the Knights of
the Ku Klux Klan north of the
Mason Dixon line—said the Klan
did not know about the festival at
the time the plans for their ap-
pearance were made, and they

(Eten Oe ee eee

pearance of the Ku Klux Klan this
weekend, the Black Arts Festival
continued as planned. Page 13.

wanted only to ‘‘raise awareness
of the organization, distribute
literature and recruit new
members.

“There was no intent to create
a disturbance,” Locke said.

The Klan will reschedule its
drive in Lewisburg for May 9,
Locke said.

Upon learning of the Klan’s
decision, Black Student Alliance
President Kevon Makell ’81 said,
“Beautiful! Now the festival can
continue without the complica-
tions of the Klan being in the
area.

The Bucknell Progressive
Caucus, which was generating
plans for a protest of the Klan’s
presence, will continue to gear up
for the now delayed arrival, Andy
Brody 82 said. Although pleased
the Klan had taken into con-
sideration the concerns of the

Black students, Brody said, “we
must demonstrate our disagree-
ment with the basic tenets of the
Klan.”

Dean of Student Affairs John
Dunlop said ‘‘Although the
Klansmen would not have been
given permission to come to cam-
pus, their decision to cancel their
visit to Lewisburg removes the
concern for those of us who
strongly support the Black Arts
Festival.”

Lewisburg Police Chief Donald
Heiter, who was also told by
Locke that the trip was cancelled,
said ‘although I hope the Klan
will not arrive tomorrow, this
does not effect any plans I have
made to provide the fullest pro-
tection in this situation.”

The Klan first made its in-
terests of recruiting in Lewisburg
known to the University and the
Lewisburg Police on Monday,
when they requested permission
to distribute literature and to
recruit new members. le

ABS passes revised scholarship proposal

FRANK DAVIS

By LISA CERUTI

The ABS Congress unanimously approved a
revised ABS scholarship proposal March 23
which was amended to include a stipulation
that recipients must have ‘‘diverse
backgrounds” as well as a “potential for ac-
tive leadership.”

The amended proposal, which was written
by members of the Steering Committee and
representatives of BSA, includes three re-
quirements for receiving aid which are in-
tended to be consistent with the “intentions of
previous legislatures,” according to ABS
President Michael Suarez ’82.

The new legislation, which ‘‘addresses the
need for a more varied student body’
specifies that scholarship funds will continue

to be awarded on the basis of diverse
backgrounds ‘‘with respect to race,
socioeconomic status and educational ex-
perience.” The second and third re-
quirements for recipients are the demonstra-
tion of financial need and the potential for ac-
tive leadership.

Suarez said the congress “felt the diversity
stipulation was implied” in the first proposal
but its intention apparently was not expressed
correctly.

Frank Davis ’82, incoming BSA President,
who was present at the drafting of the revised
proposal, said the amended legislation is
thoroughly acceptable. “The original pro-
posal had too many loopholes which could be
manipulated by the administration,” Davis
said.

Suarez said the first document was “in-
nocuous and benign. If there was a mistake, it
was mine as a presiding officer, not that of the
ABS Congress, and I erred in not miaking our
intentions clear.”

According to Director of Financial Aid
Ronald Laszewski, the revised document is a
stronger proposal and is worded more effec-
tively.

Ken Wolckenhauer ’82 said the ABS’ gift of
the scholarship is just a gesture and congress
should not get ‘wrapped up in the details.”

The scholarship proposal was revised after
a meeting of the ABS Steering Committee and
members of the Black Student Alliance
March 17 to discuss opposition to the proposal
originally passed unanimously March 10.

Faculty will attend leaders

By BILL THUM

A four member team from the University
has been selected to attend the Lilly Endow-
ment Workshop on Liberal Arts at Colorado
College in June.

The workshop, funded by the Lilly Phar-
maceutical and Medical Supply family, in-
vited 35 colleges and universities to apply for
participation to investigate topics of specific
interest to each institution, Dean of Arts and
Sciences Robert Chambers said.

The strengthening of administration and
faculty leadership was selected by Chambers
to be the topic of particular importance to the
University.

“A review of the productivity of University

committees and the difficulty of establishing
a consensus within the faculty has shown that
some help is needed,” Chambers said.

Chambers chose four areas of faculty and
administration leadership to focus on: cur-
ricular reform, eliminating mental barriers
that tend to separate the humanities and
sciences faculties, personnel matters and
staff planning.

“These problems must be managed if
Bucknell is to prevail in the 80s,” Chambers
said.

Twenty-two institutions will be attending
the workshop, which will investigate 12
specific topics of interest. A formal report
will be presented to the University at the

hip workshop

beginning of the fall semester, Chambers
said.

Chambers asked for comments and recom-
mendations on his suggestions from the facul-
ty at its monthly meeting Monday. Questions
were directed to the reasons behind the choice
of representation from the University, and
specifically to the absence of a woman on the
panel.

Chambers said -he was required to attend
by Lilly; Professor of Mathematics David
Ray and Professor of English John Wheat-
croft were selected due to their respective
positions of chairman and secretary of the
faculty; and Associate Dean of Arts and
Sciences Manning Smith was picked to repre-
sent the sciences. “

Beth Battin ‘81, Susan Macdonald ‘83, Steve Habetz ‘84 and

in the Carnegie building March 23. The ABS Congress voted
to recommend to the University Board of Trustees that a
freeze be imposed on the present 60 percent of Talent
Grant aid given to athletes.

A Talent Grants freeze
recommended by ABS

The implementation of a freeze on Athletic Talent Grant spending
at its present level of 60 percent of all University Talent Grant aid
will be recommended by the ABS Congress to the University Board
of Trustees in May. :

The Congress approved by.a vote of 14-9 March 23. a “position
paper’ which presents the views of the Congress towards the
University’s talent grant program.

In addition to the freeze on athletic grants, the paper also recom-
mends that the total talent grant program should remain at its pre-
sent level of 40 percent of all University financial aid.

ABS Secretary Lon Castle ’83 said “there have been rumors” that
the athletic talent grants would be increased to 70 percent of all
talent grants, or 28 percent of all financial aid.

According to Castle, ‘the ABS wanted to look at the financial aid
program in depth and see if we could freeze it.”

Ken Jenkins ’82, a 1981 varsity football tri-captain, said he oppos-
ed the freeze on athletic talent grants. ‘‘I think the reason the issue
came up is that the trustees are thinking about raising the percen-
tage of aid given to athletes,” he said.

ABS President Michael Suarez ’82 said the University is “aiding
only 50 percent of those who demonstrate financial need and Con-
gress believes we should not increase the amount awarded to
athletes.’’

According to Suarez,“‘ABS congresses in the past have written
position papers after votes have been taken. We're attempting to
jump the gun a little bit. This: way the faculty and trustees will

Grants for compound analyzer

received by Dept. of Chemistry

By TRICIA KENNEDY and BILL THUM

The Department of Chemistry has received grants
totalling $150,000 to purchase a Gas Chromatograph
— Mass Spectrometer Data System.

The GC -MS system is used to identify the
molecular structures of unknown compounds, in-
cluding pollutants, Professor of Chemistry Hans
Veening said. “It can be used by students in the
departments of chemistry, chemical engineering,
biology, psychology, and environmental sciences,”
Veening said.

The formal announcement of the grant was made
by Assistant Dean of Arts and Sciences and Pro-
fessor of Chemistry, Manning Smith, at the March
25 meeting of the University Committee on Plan-
ning and the Budget.

Efforts to acquire the grants began four years ago
by Veening, Chairman and Professor of Chemistry
Harold Heine and Professor of Chemical Engineer-

-ing William Snyder. University President Dennis

O’Brien “was instrumental in making contacts and
securing several sources of funds,”” Veening said.
Funds for the grant included a gift of $7,000 by the
Merck Co., $12,000 from the DuPont Corp., $50,000
from the Dreyfus Foundation and $25,000 from the
National Science Foundation. The University and
two private donors contributed the remaining

es

funds, Veening said.

A technician will be required to handle the com-
plex workings of the machine, and Veening said
two-thirds of this cost is already covered in the
Department of Chemistry’s budget for 1981 - 82. The
difference will be made up through a contingency
fund which is provided for in the University’s
budget for just such a need, Provost Wendell Smith
said.

Veening said additional funds will hopefully be
generated by outside use of the device. Although’
commercial users such as the Merck Co., the state’s
Department of Environmental Resources and
Sylvania Corp. would be charged for use, other
academic institutions will probably receive free
use, Veening said.

“The entire process of determining the 35 or more
elements in a compound could take more than 24
hours, so the firms would be charged for the time on
the machine and for the technician’s labor,” Veen-
ing said.

The GC-MS Data System will arrive on campus
during the last week in May and should be fully
operational by the end of June. Technicians from
Finnigan Instruments, maker of the system, will be
on campus to install the unit in a room on the third
floor of the Olin Science Building.

This is the Finnigan Series 4000 Gas Chromatograph-Mass Spectrometer Data System, pur-
chased with grants totalling $150,000 received by the University’s Department of Chemistry.
The data system, which will arrive on campus during the last week .in-May, will be used to
identify the molecular structures of unknown compounds, including pollutants. Funding for
the grants included: gifts from the Dreyfus Foundation, the National Science Foundation,
the DuPont Corporation and the Merck Co. in addition to the University and two private donors.

know how the ABS feels.”

The position paper also stipulates that the distribution of all talent
grant funds be reviewed periodically by the Ad-Hoc Committee on
Admissions and Financial Aid and ‘that a representative of this
committee report its findings directly’ to the ABS Congress upon
completing each review.

BPC conducts an Energy Fair

By LISA HABERNICKEL
The impact ot energy on environmental concerns,

government policy and the development cf new
resources was the topic of the Bucknell Progressive
Caucus’ Energy Fair March 22-24.

Combining a film festival and lecture with the
BPC’s second Teach-In of the semester, the BPC
sought to raise the awareness of the energy situa-
tion to the Bucknell community, organizer and BPC
member Betsy Shrier ’81 said.

Shrier and Claire McCarthy ’81 said the atten-
dance which increased from about 30 on the first
day to more than 250 on the last was very pleasing
and ‘‘demonstrated the community’s concern.”

During the teach-in, nine BPC members
presented information on energy including United
States energy policy, energy alternatives, the
Reagan Administrations’s energy biases, conserva-
tion, the limitations of fossil fuels and the potential
for oil shale development. An open floor discussion
followed.

Tom Trimble ’82 said current energy policies are

Students selected for Phi

short-sighted, and Americans in general are unable
to view the implications of the energy situation in
the long run. Henry Daas ’81 said the development
of conservation and renewable energy supplies
represented a much more realistic long range
policy than that of the continued exploitation of
fossil fuels.

Dave Jones ’81 said there was possibly a conflict
of interest in Reagan’s Energy Task Force, since
many committee members also sit on boards of
utilities and oil companies.

In addition, Secretary of Interior James Watt, a
self-pronounced anti-environmentalist, has pushed
for the continued use of fossil fuels as a panacea to
the situation, Jones said.

The final night of the energy fair brought Al
White, a leading environmentalist, to Olin Science
Auditorium to speak on decentralized energy and
designs for self-sufficient energy living. White sup-
ported individual responsibility for energy supplies
as represented by solar power in home units.

Klansmen cancel weekend rally here

From KLANSMEN, page 1.
administration’s decision to deny
the request was not to be con-
veyed to the Klan until today,
rumors of the Klan’s possible ar-
rival spurred concern of both
students and Lewisburg citizens.

Concern was acute on campus
due to the planned festival and in-
troduction of prospective black
freshmen and their families to
the campus. ‘Even if the Klan
does not try to disrupt the
festival, their presence will
definitely have a negative
psychological impact on both the
prospective freshmen and the
student organizers of the event,”
Makell said Thursday.

Originally it was believed that
the Klan had scheduled its ap-
pearance specifically to interfere
with the festival.

Emotions reached a peak
Thursday when more than 150
people attended the BPC meeting
to plan a response to the Klan.
While some called for a direct
protest of the Klan’s arrival,
Associate Professor of Sociology
Kim Scheppele said emotions
should be channeled into support
of the black students by attending
the Black Arts Festival events.
However, BSA members said
they would rather have students
attend due to their own interest
and not for other motives.

Following the meeting, 35
students went to the Lewisburg
Police Headquarters to learn
what Chief Heiter’s response
would be. Heiter said city or-

dinances didn’t permit him to
deny the Klan the opportunity to
distribute literature. He had,
however, required that a
registration form be completed
including the names and ad-
dresses of all participating
Klansmen and the specific time
period that they would be
recruiting.

In addition, Heiter said he
would distribute copies of local
ordinances and a map of the boro
to the Klansmen to insure that
there would be no misunderstan-
ding of the limits of their rights.
“If they don’t do what they
should, I’ll throw them the hell
out of town,” Heiter said.

Although Heiter wouldn’t com-
ment on the specific preparations
being made for the Klan’s ar-
rival, he said the mutual aid pro-
gram of the 15 area police depart-
ments and the State Police at
Milton had been alerted both to
the possible Klan involvement
and schedule of the festival’s ac-
tivities.

When initially contacted by the
Bucknellian Thursday night,
Locke was unaware of the scope
of the festival and said, ‘‘the coin-
cidence of the festival and the
Klan visit represent the new
reputation of the Klan in support
of freedom of choice and equal
rights for all.”

Locke said denial of permission
to recruit on campus would not
change the Klan’s plans, since
“the original interest was with
the boro itself.””

“The Klan has found that the
appearance of Klansmen in the
traditional regalia tends to incite
a bad feeling and therefore the
use of robes wouldn’t be en-
couraged,”’ Locke said.

Concerning firearms, Locke
said, ‘those members who are
legally registered to carry
firearms may do so at their own
discretion — nothing illegal will
be used.”

Early this morning, Locke
returned a call to the Bucknellian
to report that the Klan’s leader-
ship had decided to cancel the
visit. “I hope the efforts of the
blacks on campus to increase
diversity and strengthen their
education succeed and the Klan
will not try to inhibit this goal.”

on the writing proposal

From FACULTY, page 1.
hedged in what it proposed that it’s not at all clear what the program is
intended to promise.”

Professor of English and History Michael Payne said ‘‘the pro-
posal is really providing for a weaker writing program than what the
English department now offers.”

According to Associate Professor of English and committee
member-Philip Withim, the University “has to pay real attention” to
the ‘drop in the quality of students’ writing abilities.” “Writing well is
probably the single most important accomplishment one could have.
The writing program will be an attempt to deal with the problem,”
Withim said.

LaBarge said although he recognizes that the English department
is divided on the issue, he disagrees with Payne in that the proposal
will provide a stronger writing program than the existing one. ‘“‘I don’t
understand how he (Payne) arrived at the conclusion that the pro-
gram would be weaker,” LaBarge said.

If the document is approved by the faculty, each department will
be asked to develop one course in one or more of the three categories.
Some existing courses may fulfill requirements without being
redesigned.

The three course categories include “writing emphasis,” “sup-
portive writing” and “advanced writing,”’ all of which can be offered
in any department or major, according to the proposed program.

Students must take a writing emphasis course — which focuses on
“effective writing’ — during the freshman or sophomore year. An ad-
vanced writing course intended to insure that students can express
themselves in their disciplines is required during the junior or senior
year, and a course in the “supportive” category can be taken during
any semester.

The supportive courses emphasize essay writing, term papers and
multiple drafts.

According to LaBarge, the passage of the proposal will constitute
a requirement for students entering the University as freshmen in
September 1984 but will not affect anyone before then.

The current proposal originated last year when Assistant Pro-
fessor of English Catherine Smith submitted a program for improving
student writing to the committee. The proposal has been amended and
revised three times after consideration by the committee and
academic departments.

According to LaBarge, the delay in deciding the issue was causea
by systematic problems. The original proposal was submitted to all
faculty members in October and all responses were not submitted un-
til the end of November, LaBarge said.

The proposal stipulates that participation of faculty members will
be entirely voluntary and that no professor is obligated to teach
writing courses.

In addition, the proposal
is intended to determine

Soviets warned by
NATO defense aides

Defense ministers of the North
Atlantic Alliance warned the
Soviet Union ‘Thursday that
military intervention in Poland
“would have profound implica-
tions for all aspects of East-West
relations.”

The warning was issued despite
an announcement that the War-
saw Pact military maneuvers in
and around Poland had ended.

The officials also expressed
their concern about the unceas-
ing Soviet buildup and improve-
ment in the whole range of their
nuclear forces.

While individual governments
have expressed concern about
the Soviet threat to Poland, this
was the first united display of
concern by NATO over the Polish
issue.

CIA requested to

re-examine Soviets

A draft report produced by the
Central Intelligence Agency has
concluded that there is insuffi-
cient evidence to support charges
by the Reagan Administration
that the Soviet Union is directly
helping to stir up international
terrorism.

Given the public accusations by
foreign affairs spokesmen that
the Soviet Union is financing,
equipping and training interna-
tional terrorist groups, the draft
has stirred debate between CIA
officials and the Administration.

The CIA’s National Foreign
Assessments Center—the agen-
cy’s analysis unit—has been
asked by Director of Central In-
telligence William J. Casey to
review the report’s conclusions.

Congressional officials voiced
concern that this request in-
dicates the Administration’s
pressuring of the agency to tailor
its view to fit administrative
policy.

this morning’s long - awaited test
flight of the space shuttle Colum-

snag in a program already more
than two years behind schedule.

The delay of the launch — until
Sunday at the earliest — came
with the two astronauts schedul-

A requirement that more than
a half million gallons of fuel be
emptied from Columbia’s giant

Reagan’s not dead;
report is ‘sad joke’

A student newspaper columnist
and a college radio station re-
ceived rebukes last week for their
handling of the coverage of
events after the shooting of Presi-
dent Reagan March 30.

Trinity College radio station
WRTC was forced off the air for
several hours April 1 after an an-
nouncer for the station reported
that Reagan had died while in the
hospital. The station was allowed
to resume broadcasting later in
the day, but the announcer was
banished from WRTC by the
Federal Communications Com-
mission.

The Daily Pennsylavanian,
campus newspaper at the Univer-
sity of Pennsylavania, included a
column the same day by Dominic
Manno, who wrote that he hoped
Reagan would die from the
wound he received in the
shooting. The governing board of
the newspaper suspended Man-
no’s column after its publication.

but, undetermined amounts of
alcohol and caffeine were
discovered.

The death is believed to be ac-

District Attorney has not ruled
out the possibility of ‘foul play.”

EDITORIALS
Sigh of relief

At first there was a moment of tense disbelief. Could it really be
that a leader of the Klan was calling off what we were then sure was
a direct protest of the Black Arts Festival? Assured by the Klan
leader that they had indeed demurred, we let forth a communal sigh
of ecstatic relief.
It is a sigh we hope you will join us in, for we have all been
spared a weekend potentially fraught with a level of tension that
could have gone far beyond even the fervor and scope of the anxiety
traditionally associated with a meeting between blacks and their
historic tormentors. Despite the stated intentions of the Klan’s visit
to Lewisburg — Locke assured us from the start the Klansmen
would concentrate on recruiting downtown rather than harassment
near campus — the emotions of minority students and ‘“‘majority”
students alike could have ignited whether or not the visitors
displayed physical or verbal reminders of their reputation.
Thankfully, that fuse has been lengthened until May 9, when
Locke says 20 or more representatives of the KKK will conduct the
drive for membership that was to have been Saturday morning.
Given a month to prepare ourselves emotionally, students of all col-
ors should be ready, willing and able to react to or ignore anyone
from the Klan we come in contact with that day. It will be tough for
the blacks to stifle an almost inbred hatred in a way the whites may Sue Willis
not understand; it may be equally as difficult for many white
students to stifle a curiosity blacks might find disgusting.
In the meantime, let us all relax and enjoy the ‘‘poeting”’ of b.f.

No gun laws means a house divided under the gun

~ By Dean Andersen

It was a sobering Spring Break.
The events thai took place made
a farce of what daily events we
consider ‘“‘important.” The fin-
ding of yet two more bodies in
Atlanta and the assassination at-
tempt on President Reagan caus-
ed even more despair for our
already grief-stricken country. A
very bad feeling is in the air, and
we are plagued by it.

After we received the good
news that Reagan would live and
we all had a chance to take a
breath, conversation turned to
the would-be assassin and his
weapon — the handgun. Current-
ly, there are bills floating around
the Senate which have, as their
intention, the “lifting” of gun
‘control. This means that people
could legally possess a firearm
and would be licensed to carry it.

If this piece of legislation goes
through, it would, in my opinion,
prove to be the very downfall of
America.

The problem lies within
ourselves. We are becoming con-
ditioned to think that murder
with a firearm is commonplace
and that the solution is to “give
everybody a gun so that we’ll be
evenly matched.” The anti-gun
control proponents see the lifting
of such laws as a way for “‘honest
people to protect themselves.”

But there is no protection against
a gun.

Lifting gun contro! would only
make the destruction that much
easier to do. Fanatics would have
a field day: there would be shoot-
outs in major cities and vigilante
groups would scour the coun-
tryside looking for trouble.

We can’t hide behind guns. Ar-

ming ourselves to the teeth and
then running scared will only
serve to pull us even ‘farther
apartasanatior. Imagine this:
every person in America, each
one a frightened individual,
would become a walking time
bomb, ready to go off at the
slightest notion of trouble, even if
none exists. There would be a

total breakdown of trust. We
would eye our neighbor with
suspicion, actually expecting him
or her to attack us.
Psychologically, we would
alienate ourselves — no longer
would we be “One Nation, Under
God.” We would now be ‘‘A House
Divided, Under the Gun,”’ a coun-
try of pistol-packin’ mamas,

papas and kiddies.

In the wake of last week’s hap-
penings, the time has come to
ask: Is this really what we want
for the United States of America?

Promise of justice for all is a thing of the past

By Glen Tullman

The choice between guns and butter is a simple description to

help understand the decisions our country is now facing.

For many years, we as a nation have enjoyed prosperity. We
have been rich enough to afford guns and butter. While we carried
on the most expensive war in history, we also managed to start a
“war” on poverty, although we didn’t do especially well on either.

We no longer live in a time of prosperity. The economic crisis has
forced the country to reevaluate our priorities. The Reagan Ad-
ministration has apparently opted for guns over butter, but this is
not what concerns me here. More important is the subtle decision
that we, as individuals, have made or at least come to accept — we
can no longer afford justice for all.

In a growing economy, it is easy for an individual to be just and
fair because it ‘‘costs’’ nothing. But in a stagnant economy, things
are much different. When the pie stops growing, giving someone a
bigger slice means getting less. It costs to be fair.

Not only has the pie stopped growing, but inflation seems to be
shrinking it. People are having to accept less, and many are seeing
that the dream that one’s children will be better off than one is only
a dream. But as Ellen Goodman said recently, ‘There is a dif-
ference between the lives of people whose paychecks are not keep-
ing up with inflation and the lives of people who have no paychecks

at all.” Increasingly, our concerns are for our own prosperity, even
at the cost of others’ justice.

The signs of this new “‘cost’”’ attached to justice and fairness are
apparent in all sectors of society. A recent government survey of
high school seniors ‘found a sharp decline in the percentage of
those who believe that working to correct social and economic ine-
qualities is very important.”

Another sign is in the lack of opposition to Reagan’s South
African policy. Reagan sees South Africa as necessary, not to our
survival, which in fact it is not, but to our prosperity. Will the coun-
try be willing to overlook racial discrimination for prosperity? If
things get worse, will the same attitude prevail here?

Senator Edward Kennedy, said, ‘The commitment I seek is
not to outworn views, but to old values that will never wear out.
Programs may sometimes become obsolete, but the idea of
fairness always endures. The middle class may be angry, but they
have not lost the dream that all Americans can advance together.”
Frankly, I’m not sure — perhaps we have lost the dream. Perhaps
it has become too expensive. But let us beware: if we cannot afford
justice and fairness, which is really what our actions and decisions
are telling us, the other options may be more expensive in the long
run and the savings may be no bargain at all.

Glen Tullman is a senior from New Providence, N.J. who majors in
psychology and economics.

Realism rebuked by BPC with occasional cynicism

By Keith B. Ritter

I don’t understand the Bucknell Pro-
gressive Caucus.

I’ve always thought of myself as pro-
gressive, yet 1 find many of their
arguments untenable. To me, a pro-
gressive is one who has struck a har-
monious balance between the often discor-
dant dispositions of realism and idealism.
Maybe I’m wrong, but the Caucus seems to
have rebuked realism, giving it only an oc-
casional cynical mention.

Why my cynicism with the Caucus? I
guess it evolved slowly only to be ac-
celerated recently by the rantings of the
Catechist. I wanted to accept the group as
progressive, but their actions continued to
bother me. I suppose the last straw was
their opposition to the ROTC war games;
that did it. In my mind I must proclaim —
the Bucknell Progressive Caucus is not
progressive.

To me, the recent BPC outburst against
the ROTC demonstrates that not only has
the Caucus lost touch with reality; it also

has no desire to reacquaint itself with
reality. I agree with the Caucus that war
and killing are morally repulsive — I
haven’t lost my idealism — but I accept
the fact that governments and thus wars
will probably always exist.

I don’t think that the Caucus is anar-
chistic, so I think they would agree that
governments serve a purpose, namely to
insure the rights and safety of their
citizens. It does not take much of a realist
to recognize that humans have been
fighting since before people bothered to

record history, and that they are not likely
to stop tomorrow. Governments, since
they are merely extensions of human vir-
tues and vices, shall also continue to fight
and kill — although hopefully not as fre-
quently as in the past.

If one accepts the sad though realistic
belief that wars will indeed occur from
time to time, the next logical concern is
who should be in control of the fighting
forces. Again, I may be idealistic, but I
would much rather have a college-
educated individual leading the troops
than some former street gang member.

Perhaps exposing someone to a little
history, a modicum of philosophy, and a
sprinkling of other assorted courses will
instill a greater sense of morality and
justice in that person. Maybe, just maybe,
such training will help prevent such
atrocities as My Lai from occurring in the
future. The possibility, however remote, of
preventing these tragedies justifies such a
program.

Once these recruits have been chosen,
they will need to practice. One would be a
fool to think that quoting Plato could pre-
vent the enemy’s assault; and one would
have to be a fool, and a sadistic one at that,
to suggest that untrained soldiers should
be sent to fight.

Now, if you are going to train
Bucknellians to fight, where should it be
done? In the outreaches of Alaska, the
deserts of Arizona, or R. B. Winter State
Park? No. All of these places would be
fine, but let’s be practical. If there is an ap-
propriate place to practice on campus,
that is where they should practice.

But wait — the Caucus might interject —
there is a moral issue involved here.
Wrong. War is a part of human nature,
albeit an unfortunate and tragic one. It is
the Progressive Caucus that continually
claims that Bucknell is akin to never-never
land and that the students need to be better
briefed on what is happening in the ‘‘real
world.”

What better way is there to do this than
by bringing a taste of war, even if it is only
a practice war, here to Bucknell?

Beware of religious

ERS eR oan eee ee
By Phil Andrews

“Moral Majority” became a
household name in 1980. The
politically active religious group
played a major role in the defeats
of liberal Senators Birch Bayh,
Frank Church, John Culver and
George McGovern.

The organization was widely
criticized, however, for
trumpeting itself as the “Moral
Majority.” A member of the
Unicorn Society — a group that
seeks to abolish inaccurate
descriptives — said, “I am not
sure whether they are moral or
not, but I am sure they are not a
majority.”

The latter part of this observa-
tion was recently confirmed
amidst the intriguing results of a
survey conducted for the Connec-
ticut Mutual Life Insurance Com-
pany by John C. Pollack of
Research and Forecasts, Inc. Ac-
cording to Connecticut Mutual,
the survey sought to assess
“American values in the 1980s.”

The survey consisted of a
public sample and a leadership
sample. Of the 4,000 people inter-
viewed for the public sample,
1,610 completed the one-hour
telephone interview. And of the
4,388 leaders in nine different
fields sent questionnaires
through the mail, 1,762 respond-
ed.

What did the results show?

1. There is not a ‘Moral Ma-
jority” in the United States, but
that America’s institutions are
increasingly being shaped by a
fervently religious minority that
has a much higher sense of
political efficacy than do those
people surveyed categorized as
least religious.

On an eight-criterion scale of
religionity ranging from Bible
reading to prayer to religious
proselytizing, 26 percent of the
respondents reported that they
frequently did at least five of
eight activities.

The report, Pollock said, ‘‘iden-

a contagious out-of-state disease?
Both aon wei

By Jeff Casten

I have recently noticed an outburst around the
surrounding area of a strange disease. I have

diagnosed this disease as the dreaded Easter Syn-
drome

This disease has many different symptoms, one of
the most obvious being the darkening of the super-
ficial epidermal layer. After several days a white
flaky material and darker brown spots appear on
the face and other exposed areas. The victim of the
dreaded Easter Syndrome is often found with a
large economy-size bottle of lotion among his per-
sonal possessions.

their tendency to wear light colored clothing and
short sleeved shirts.

I have discussed this matter in depth with my
fellow classmates but still have no definite evidence
as to what the cause of this dreaded disease might
be. I do, however, know that the victim travels out
of the state of Pennsylvania just before acquiring
the disease. Therefore, I theorize that the Easter
Syndrome must exist in other states and be con-
tagious.

I know of no cure for the dreaded Easter Syn-
drome. All that I can suggest is that you remain in-
side your home, wear heavy clothing, lock all the
doors and windows and, most importantly, do not go

I have also observed that the wealthier class is
more susceptible to this disease. The carriers of the
mostly adolescent, often gather
in small groups, as if they were actually proud of be-
ing victims. Their most common symptom would be

Easter Syndrome,

demonstrates that religious
Americans are likely to vote
often and to become highly in-

munities.”

2.The main criterion

PHILLING IN

separating religious and non-
religious persons is age. Almost
half of Americans over 64 classify
as religious, as compared to one-
sixth of those between 14 and 34.

Interestingly, the survey found
the relation between religious
commitment and political con-
servatism to be slim.

3. America’s leaders are
significantly less religious than
the general public. Thus, they
may underestimate the influence
of religion in American life.

The study showed that religious
people in the public sample were
much more concerned about the
morality of abortion, homosex-
uality, extramarital sex, por-

nography and marijuana than
respondents in the leaders sam-
ple.

4. The issues which divide
Americans most are “moral.”
For example, 74 percent of the
religious respondents oppose sex
between two single people, while
only 11 percent of the non-

These findings, says the report,
“illuminate the political suc-
cesses of such groups as the
‘Moral Majority’ and suggest
that it may be the intensely
religious who may well be the
most vocal group in the ’80s.”

The report concludes, “This
new trend is both heartening and
potentially frightening. Since the
injection of faith into politics via
religion is capable of creating a
single powerful voting bloc, this
suggests the opportunity for a
truly visionary leader, or a
dangerous demagogue, who — by
striking the appropriate
religious-moral notes — could be
swept into a position of awesome
power.””

obviously, beware.

Crosby to give acoustic
concert here on May 5

By ALLISON ABOUCHAR

Singer David Crosby, formerly of the popular rock group “Crosby,
Stills, Nash and Young,” will give two concerts of acoustic music at 7
and 10 p.m. May 5 in Coleman Theatre.

There will be a warm-up band appearing with Crosby, but since no
one has been presented with a concert bid, ticket prices have not been
set, according to Assistant Bucknell Concert Committee Chairman
Rich Schaberg ’81.

Because the David Bromberg concert in March was so well received
by students, the BCC decided to hold the Crosby concert in Coleman
Theatre with reserved seats. The hall has better acoustics and the
smaller size lends a more intimate atmosphere, Schaberg said.

Crosby has been contracted for $4000 for the two shows, and his ap-
pearance here wiil be in conjunction with a tour.

Crosby began his musical career in the 1960s with ‘‘The Birds,” and
began singing with ‘‘Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young”’ at Woodstock in
1969. The band broke up and reunited several times, once in 1971 and
then again in 1974, when they recorded the popular album ‘‘CSN”’
without Young.

Ninth Black Arts Festival opens with play & lecture

Festival opened here yesterday
with a lecture in the afternoon by
Sylvia Ardyn Boone, assistant
professor of history and Afro-
American art at Yale University,
and a presentation last night by
the Labor Theater of New York
City.

Boone spoke about “Ideas and
Ideals of Beauty in African Art,”
while the Labor Theater
presented Railroad Bill, a play
set in the context of the Populist
movement of the 1890s and
depicting the true story of a black
train robber who became the
legendary ‘‘black Jesse James”
of his day. Written by C.R. Portz,
the show was accompanied by
rousing blues and ragtime music.

The Labor Theater is made
possible through funding from
the National Endowment for the
Arts.

Nationally known poet b.f.
maiz will recite his poetry in a
reading entitled ‘May I Poet with
You?’ in the University Center

Forum at 7 p.m. tonight. Maiz,
originally from Alabama, will
give a workshop entitled ‘‘Ques-
tions about life” from 3:15 to 4:15
this afternoon in the U.C. Corner
Room. Maiz has written more
than 1000 poems which he has
committed to memory. He first
submerged himself in poetry
while in prison where it became
his ‘heaven, hell and salvation.’

Maiz served a total of 18 years
in federal prison as a result of
several drug violations.

“Job Opportunities for Young

by John Smith of the U.S. Com-
mittee on Labor and Education.
He will speak from 11 a.m. to
12:30 p.m. Saturday in the U.C.
Corner Room.

Two young lawyers will con-
duct a workshop on ‘“‘Law in the

The Woody Shaw Quintet, a
jazz group from New York City,

will conduct a clinic at 3:30 p.m.
in the U.C. Forum in which the
group will play and discuss
music. The Quintet will also give
a concert at 8 p.m. Saturday in
the University Theatre. Tickets
are $5, or $2 with a Bucknell ID.

The Rev. Lee Butler '81 will

Masks exhibit presents
playful pieces andmore

By KAREN RITCH

‘An exhibit of masks by 18 artists—illustrating some of the most
innovative and vigorous examples of the contemporary art form—
opened Tuesday night in the Center Gallery at a reception attended
by more than 100 people.

Many of the masks in the exhibition, which was curated by the
Visiting Artists Collaborative and circulated by Independent
Curators Inc. of New York City, were created for use in per-
formances, while others are sculptural facades which examine the
face and the mask as an expression of being.

Constructed from such diverse materials as papier mache,
acrylic, crocheted wool, wax and gauze, plaster, wood and leather,
the masks in the exhibit range in size from small facial coverings to
more than four feet in height. The display is accompanied by a
checklist and essay by Anne Cohen De Pietio, formerly associated
with ICI.

The artists in this exhibition chose varied forms of the mask as a
viable medium with significant impact. Peter Schumann, of the
Bread and Puppet Theatre, creates colorful caricatures which
delight both the children and adults in his audiences. As traditional
expressions of the mask in drama, these playful pieces have their
roots in classical Greek theater,

Jeff Way uses the mask as a-traditional medium in the perform-
ing arts, but his bold abstract forms convey a more contemporary
expression. These masks create anonymity without providing a
new identity.

Many of the other artists in the exhibition explore the meaning of
the mask as a visual statement rather than as a disguise to be worn.
In her 29 pieces, Theodora Skipitares creates a feeling of move-
ment, like freeze-frame photography, by repeatedly focusing on the
face as a means of expressing emotion. Conversely, Nina Hallinger
uses the mask as a purely sculptural form, void of emotion, as in
her latex body mask titled “Skin.” .

The show will remain here until April 28. The Center Gallery is
located in the third floor of the University Center and is open
weekdays from 12:30-4:30 p.m.

Spring theater season ushered
in with one-act ‘Cocktail’ series

By LYNNE RUTHERFORD

The spring theater season will be ushered in with
a series of one-act plays being held in the University
Center Cave beginning this week.

These ‘Cocktail Theaters” —so named for their
pre-dinner starting time of 4:45 p.m.—are free
entertainment provided by Professor of English and
Theater Harvey Powers’ directing class. The
Cocktails are the first chance students get to direct
here and they open doors for fresh acting talent as
well. Many of the works are more experimental and
unusual in nature than the regular Coleman Theatre
fare.

For instance, Wednesday’s The American Dream
by Edward Albee, as directed by John Braile ’83, in-
cluded film footage and slides, as well as a piano ac-
companiment by Terri Barous 83.

Next up will be Ernest Thompson’s lighthearted
comedy, A Good Time—to be performed this after-
noon and directed by Jackie Krull ’83. The play in-
volves a girl who talks her way out of a traffic ticket
by promising a policeman ‘“‘a good time”’ and deals
with the complications that arise when the man
comes to claim his bribe two years later.

On Wednesday, A Touch of Marble comes to the
Cave. Directed by Dawn Sanderson ’82, the play ex-

plains a 34-year-old woman’s present loneliness by
exploring her past.

Peter Swet’s The Interview portrays the con-
flict between an old Jewish tailor and an arrogantly
efficient insurance investigator. Directed by
Jawaad Abdul Azziz ’82, it will be staged Friday.

On April 24, Eugene Ionesco’s The Bald Soprano,
under the direction of Cynthia Lempert ’82, will be
performed. An absurd comedy, it is a wordplay be-
tween a group of people attempting but failing to
communicate.

Fumed Oak—described by author Noel Coward as
“an unpleasant comedy in two scenes’’—will take
the spotlight May 6. A frustrated man decides to
leave his crabby household in this play directed by
Donna Hansen ’83.

Director Bruce Delaplane ’82 will stage Conrad
Bromberg’s Actors on May 8. The play deals with
two actors discussing life over a game of chess.

The Collection, Harold Pinter’s play of two col-
liding relationships—one involving two men and the
other concerning a man and a woman, is directed by
David Hancock ’84 and is scheduled for May 11.

The season comes to a close with Frank Marcus’
The Window directed by David Blackman ’82, which
explores the cruelty inflicted by individuals who
prey ona blind man.

Ken Durr '82 at work during the baseball team’s 19-2 drub-
bing by Lock Haven on Memorial Field Tuesday. Durr's best
outing of the season thus far was Saturday, when he struck-
out nine men en route to a 4-3 win over Hobart.

Bison baseball 3-6

Upset of Delaware highlight to date

By ROBERT BURNEY

While the closest they came to Florida was suburban Baltimore,
the young Bison baseball squad took full advantage of the balmy
northeastern weather over Spring Break, managing to equal the
number of victories the team posted all last season.

Faced with his youngest team in several years, Coach Tommy
Thompson has witnessed indications that Bucknell’s baseball
outlook may be brightening if the Bisons can nail down the elusive
element of consistency — and maybe enjoy a few breaks.

The season began inauspiciously enough, as opening day guest
Franklin & Marshall treated its hosts to a 5-2 setback behind pit-
cher Joe Ready. Ken Durr ’82 took the loss. The short jaunt down to
Selinsgrove on March 22 proved itself disastrous, as the Herd suc-
cumbed to Susquehanna, 9-7.

Loss of the game became secondary, however, to the loss of junior
shortshop Jim Cawley, who suffered a broken leg in the first inning,
while attempting to complete a double play. “We really can’t afford
to lose him,” lamented Thompson. “He’s been our starting short-
stop and hit over .300 last season.”

Since Cawley’s injury, freshman John Cornell and Jim Eick 82
have seen service at shortstop.

Returning to Lewisburg, the Herd bounced back with a
doubleheader sweep of Hobart. Senior Tom Ganter picked up the
first victory of his Bucknell career in the first game, as he pitched.
seven strong innings en route to a 6-3 triumph. The nightcap saw
the Bisons score a run in the bottom of the seventh to secure a 4-3
outcome. Durr pitched the second Bucknell complete game of the
afternoon, striking out nine while walking only one, as he evened
his record to 1-1 and the team mark to 2-2.

The elements and the umpires proved the Bisons’ undoing on
April Fools’ Day, when they took on Towson State in Towson, Md.

The next day in New Brunswick, N.J. was one to forget, as
Rutgers blasted the Bisons 17-11. Bucknell scored seven times in
the top of the ninth to make the score respectable, but it was “not a
bad game on all accounts,” according to Thompson. His pitchers,
Canter, Jim Smith ’84 and Rich Bongiovanni *82 gave up 12 earned
runs between them, while their teammates committed five errors.
Carl Nablo ’82 doubled twice and Frantz homered for the Bisons.

On Saturday, the team returned to Lewisburg and hosted
Delaware in a doubleheader. It had been eight years since the
Bisons had beaten the Blue Hens, a perennial eastern powerhouse,
and nothing seemed different in the first contest as Durr pitched
well, but received no support: his teammates committed six errors
while scoring only once.

The Hens broke on top in the nightcap with a run in the first, but
the Bisons came back with two of their own in the bottom of the inn-
ing. They added four in the third for a six-run lead, including a
homer by Dow. Delaware picked up two in the fourth, but the Herd
countered with two of its own in the sixth. A lone Blue Hen run in the
ninth was inconsequential, as the Bisons came away with the big

Lacrosse is off to a slow start;

defeats Gettysburg but loses 3

By KEN QUAAS

“We're having a problem put-
ting together four good quarters
of lacrosse,” said senior tri-
captain Stu Berger in describing
the play of the Bisons since their
7-5.season-opening victory over
Franklin & Marshall.

The laxmen dropped a tough
contest to nationally-ranked
Rutgers Wednesday in New
Brunswick, 15-9, but it was a first
quarter lapse from which the
Bisons never recovered that
made the difference in the game.

The Scarlet Knights came out
firing on their home turf, jump-
ing to a 51 first period ad-
vantage. The stunned laxmen
countered with some offense of
their own and pulled the score up
to within three at the half, with
Rutgers on top 7-4.

But despite some good defen-
sive play, particularly on the part
of senior tri-captain Jim Gilbert
in sticking high-scoring at-

CES : Cc

man-down

tackman Mark Tyree and holding
him to just three tallies, Bucknell
never recovered from the first
quarter onslaught which left the
team playing catch-up ball.

“I thought we could have
beaten them,” said a disap-
pointed Berger following the
match, “but they beat us to the
ground ball, and our first quarter
killed us.”

The lacrosse team now stands
at 2-3, with eight regular season
games to play. The laxmen spent
part of their Spring Break in
Maryland competing in the
Loyola Tournament. Powerhouse
Maryland — ranked fifth na-
tionally — gave the Bisons a
drubbing in the second half of the
tourney opener after the team
held the Terps to seven goals in
the first half. The depth of
talented Maryland’s bench as
well as 14 penalties assessed the
Bisons — resulting in continuous
situations—contri-

buted to a score that ballooned
from 7-3 to 19-6.

The laxmen were not destined
to enjoy a relaxing Spring Break,
as Loyola, ranked No. 2 in Divi-
sion II, pinned them with a 16-8
loss in the consolations. Like the
Maryland duel, the Bisons were
well within reach at the half,
trailing 8-6. And once again, it
was the sloppy second half lapses
which sent the team back to
Lewisburg with its first losses of
the season.

The break did end on a happy
note, however, as Gettysburg
was dealt a 13-7 setback April 1.
Junior tri-captain John Morris
paved the way by notching five
goals, while George Cusick 83
and Rob Mathai ’82 added three
and two, respectively.

Gulden says trackmen c

ould improve

By MELISSA BAIR
“There are a lot of encouraging things, but there
is no room for slacking off,” Coach Art Gulden said
about Bucknell’s men’s track team this week.

~ Photo—Charlie Berul
Gary Bartlett '82 — shown here during an in-

door track practice — attained personal best
distances in both the shot put and the hammer
throw during Tuesday's tri-meet

The past three meets indicate that the team is
“performing better than indoors,” Gulden said.

The Bisons showed a good performance at a tri-
meet against Lehigh and West Chester Tuesday,
with Bucknell scoring 99 points to Lehigh’s 69 and
West Chester’s meager 31.

Gary Bartlett ’82 made “one of his better per-
formances,” Gulden said, achieving two firsts and a
second, and two personal bests in the shot and ham-
mer.

Mike Geraghty ’84 has been running well and is

consistently under 50 seconds in the quarter mile,”
Mike Debraggio ’81 said. Geraghty won the 400
meter on Tuesday.
- At the Colonial Relay in Williamsburg Sunday,
Rick Sayre ’82 qualified for Nationals in a 3000
meter steeplechase with a time of 9 minutes, 15.4
seconds and Mark Hulme ’83 finished second in the
1500 meter run at 4 minutes, 3 seconds. Al Wegener
81 threw the javelin 203.5 feet, his personal best,
while Mike Ward ’82 threw 49.6 feet in shot put at the
meet at William and Mary.

Bucknell won two relay victories and one in-
dividual at the Delaware State Relays Friday.

Coach Gulden said in order for the team to win the
East Coast Conference Championship, “we must
have a better performance than we did Tuesday. We
got 80 percent of what we wanted that day,”’ but in
order to beat Ryder and Drexel in the Finals,
Bucknell must do better, Gulden said.

Bucknell is at Ryder with Lafayette and Drexel
Saturday.

Kuralt lecture
fills Vaughan

to overflowing

By MARY LISA MURGIANO

Charles Kuralt delighted more than 600
people with tales of his career traversing
the country-or CBS News Tuesday night,
but only after the correspondent’s talk had
to go ‘‘on the road” from the University
Center Forum to Vaughan Literature
Auditorium to accommodate the crowd.

The popularity of the newsman — the
third guest in this year’s Class of 53
Lectureship — forced University officials
to change the venue of Kuralt’s talk
minutes before its scheduled start.

Dean of Arts and Sciences Robert
Chambers directed the crowd to the lec-
ture’s new location after assuring local
residents in the audience — some of whom
had arrived as much as 40 minutes early —
that there would be seats for them there.

After a near stampede as people ran
from the Forum to the auditorium,
Chambers thanked the townspeople and
the students for their patience ‘“‘under
unusually trying circumstances.”

The anchorman of the CBS “Morning”
series then began a 90-minute recitation of
anecdotes and thoughts about America
and his view of it from out “‘On the Road.”

“There have been many great events in
the past twenty years and T have missed
them all,” Kuralt said.

Kuralt cited the value of commenting on
such hard news events as the space shuttle
Columbia, then said, ‘I sure wish (Walter )

Nuke waste may

be burned here

Regulations for disposal eased

By MATT KARANIAN

The University may begin
burning a few radioactive ani-
mal carcasses at the Physical
Plant each year rather than con-
tinue shipping them to a radio-
active waste burial ground in
Washington State.

In a memo obtained by the
Bucknellian, Professor of Biology
Jack Harclerode suggested to
members of the administration
March 27 that animal carcasses
contaminated in experiments
here be incinerated at the Uni-
versity’s power plant, thereby
saving ‘‘several thousand dollars
annually” in transportation and
burial costs.

Amended Nuclear Regulatory
Commission regulations now per-
mit the University and other li-
censed institutions ‘greater lee-
way” for disposal of liquid scin-
tillation media and animal car-
casses containing trace levels of
tritium or carbon-14. Biology
department experiments here
produce both of these substances.

The University has yet to reach
a decision on the issue, however,
and the matter is ‘‘still in the

decision stage,” according to
Vice President for Administra-
tion and Finance John Zeller.

The NRC regulations—which
became effective March 11—per-
mit the disposal of “specified
concentrations of these materials
without regard to their radioac-
tivity.” The commission’s regu-
lations permitting incineration
“doesn’t mean that the burning
is safe,” however, according to
Charles Eaton ’83, a spokesman
for the Environmental Subcom-
mittee of the Bucknell Progres-
sive Caucus. ‘‘We’d like proof
that burning is safe,”’ Eaton said
Thursday.

The subcommittee has peti-
tioned the Biology department
and members of the Administra-
tion for an ‘‘open panel discus-
sion to educate students and local
residents how our health and en-
vironment may be affected,” he
said.

Harclerode said Thursday it
is “safer and more desirable
from all standpoints’’ to inciner-
ate the radioactive substances
here instead of transporting them

Sig Derby is modified following Panhell’s demands

By LISA CERUTI

Three events of Sig Derby Week have been eliminated
or revised in response to demands made by the Panhel-
lenic Council after negotiations between Sigma Chi fra-
ternity and Panhell.

Panhell sent a letter to Sigma Chi—which sponsors the
week—in February saying the sororities have “agreed
that if there are not some constructive changes made
before this coming Sig Derby weekend, they will refuse to
participate.” The letter, which was drafted in December,
describes the skits performed by the sorority pledges at
Sig Derby as “degrading” and “untrue to their charac-
ter.”

It also cites the derby chase, which involves the
pledges chasing Sigma Chi brothers in order to grab their
hats, as a ‘dangerous event for men as well as women.”

Sig Derby Week, scheduled for April 22-25, is intended

to raise money for Sigma Chi’s national philanthropy—
Wallace Village—a facility for emotionally disturbed and
learning disabled children in Colorado. The week’s acti-
vities at the University have traditionally included soro-
rity pledges competing in a derby chase, house decorating
contest, skits, field games, derby hunt and banner and
legs contests in order to gain points toward ‘‘winning”’ Sig
Derby.

According to Panhellenic Council Vice President Pat-
ricia Campbell ’82, the council has been ‘‘generally dis-
satisfied for some time” with the derby chase, skits and
house decorations as well as the “unhealthy sorority
competition. We've been making noise about Sig Derby
for so long, it was finally time to do something about it,”
she said.

In an effort to resolve the problem, Sig Derby Chairman
Don Zacune 81 and Sigma Chi President Doug Collett

’g2 have met repeatedly with six Panhellenic represen-
tatives to discuss possible revisions of Sig Derby activi-
ties.

According to Zacune, the changes agreed upon by Pan-
hell and Sigma Chi include eliminating the event in which
sororities decorate the fraternity’s house and having
sororities participate in a talent show, rather than per-
form individual skits. In addition, the derby chase will
probably be conducted with the help of referees and will
encompass a smaller area, he said.

A Sigma Chi executive committee will meet to discuss
the final rules sometime next week, Zacune said.

Panhellenic representative Linda Jamison 82 said
Panhell ‘‘wants to make sure the events we participate
in are not harmful or degrading to the pledges.”

According to Jamison, the council is interested in help-

ABS members lobbying against
more proposed Federal aid cuts

WASHINGTON — _ Three
members of the Association of
Bucknell Students Congress were
among the estimated 1200
students from 48 states here
Monday to lobby against the
Reagan Administration’s
proposed cutbacks in financial
assistance programs for college
students.

ABS Vice President Missy
Campbell ’82, Trax Dorm Council
President Steve Habetz ’84 and
Roberts Dorm Representative
Tricia Kennedy ’84 represented
the University at the Coalition of
Independent College and
University Seudents (COPUS)-
sponsored National Student
Briefing Day on Student Aid Cuts.

The conference opened Monday
morning with a briefing of
student delegates by COPUS
National Director Steve Leifman,
Chairman of the House Post-
secondary . Education Sub-
committee Paul Liman (D.-Ill.)
and Rep. Peter Peyser (D.-N.Y.),
amember of that subcommittee.

Students were urged to actively

according to Leifman, ‘‘in effect
will repeal” the 1979 Middle
Income Student Assistance Act.

Following the briefing,
students sought out their
representatives in the Senate and
House office buildings. But since
Congress is now in recess, many
of the congressmen were not in
town.

“Tt was discouraging that no
one was there to hear our views,
since those plans will directly
affect me and many others,”
Habetz said.

Under the anticipated budget
for fiscal year 1982, the Ad-
ministration has proposed to
increase the tax rate on
discretionary income calculated
in the Pell Grant (BEOG) from 14
percent to 20 percent. The Ad-
ministration would in addition
require an annual $750 self-help
contribution from students,
except in cases of extreme
financial need.

The Administration has also
proposed eliminating 40 percent
of the current recipients of

requiring the demonstration of
real need for the amounts
borrowed from private lending
institutions..

Should the Reagan proposals
be voted into law, according to
the American Council on
Education, an estimated 600,000
of the 2.7 million students now
receiving such grants of $200 to
$1800 would be dropped from the
program. Countless others would
be forced to accept substantial
reductions in the grants they will
receive.

The Council said the
elimination of Federal payment
of student loan interest could add
$2250 to the cost of four years of
college and cause huge numbers
of students to drop out.

In addition, these educators
expressed concern that lower
income ceilings on student loans
might force small private
colleges to close, since more
students will be likely to enroll in
less costly public institutions.

By JEFF CROSS

In an effort to make the ABS Congress more
effective, former ABS President Phil An-
drews ’81 has recommended that upperclass
dormitory representatives be replaced with
representatives from departmental majors.

Andrews also made 10 other proposals con-
cerning structure and operation of the ABS in
a paper presented to Congressmen Monday.
The report is the first study of the governance
structure as it now exists since its inception in
1978.

The Congress will hear a formal proposal
from Andrews April 7.

Since most students feel more kinship with
their department than with their living unit,
they would have a greater responsibility in
their representation of their department,
Andrews said. Dormitory representatives
hold 23 of the 42 Congress seats but are infre-
quent participants, according to Andrews.

Freshman dormitory representatives
would be retained due to their strong attach-

guaranteed student loans by

BPC GEARS UP FOR KKK—Professor of English Karl Patten addresses the Bucknell Progres-

mine the caucus’ official response to the Ku Klux Klan’s scheduled appearance in Lewisburg
May 9. The BPC decided to counter the Klan’s membership drive with a counter-drive to warn

ment to their dormitories, Andrews said.

The report’s other major proposal is to em-
power the ABS vice president, instead of the
president, with control of congress meetings.
The president ‘‘tends to dampen criticism,”
Andrews said, and ‘“‘many congressmen are
wary of being overly critical of the presi-
dent’s suggestions.”

With the president free to concentrate on
executive duties, the additional power of the
veto could be added as a check on the con-
gressional actions, Andrews said.

The proposal would also create two new
posts in the ABS steering committee. The
president would appoint a press secretary to
accurately disseminate information about the
congress, and an elections director would
be added to relieve the responsibility of the
vice president and protect against any con-
flicts of interest in an election. Both would be
subject to the congress’ approval.

The final structural change would require

Campbell, who met with

several congressmen and their
staffs representing districts in
New Jersey and Pennsylvania
during the afternoon, said she
was “pleased” with the overall
response of government officials
to the students’ lobbying efforts.
She noted that ‘there is a real
need for students to write to their
representatives concerning this
issue.”

Explosion in Olin brings
$1000 total in damages

An explosion Friday afternoon ‘in a top floor laboratory of the Olin
Science Building caused an estimated $1,000 damage to equipment and
‘ supplies, and raised serious questions about the adequacy of ventila-

tion in the lab.

Head and Professor of Chemistry Harold Heine described the explo-
sion as a “vapor air explosion.” He said a “tremendous amount” of
dioxane vapors and air ‘‘got into the hood and got sparked,” probably

causing the explosion.

Although the exhaust hood was apparently working properly, the
laboratories need “‘more efficient hood motors,” Heine said.
Although one person was in the laboratory room at the time of the

5:05 p.m. blast, no one was injured.

The student conducting the procedure in the hood, Regina Zibuck ’81,
said she was attempting to dry the chemical dioxane, a solvent, which
is used in experiments in its pure state. She said that “setting up was
the only part’ of the process that involved her presence. Zibuck was
not in the building at the time of the explosion.

Graduate student Dennis Wright — the only person present during
the explosion — escaped unharmed.

emergency call and notified the fire department upon arriving on the

dent and treasurer to run together to foster
coherence on the steering committee. ‘‘Just
the fact that they are willing to team up says
something about their compatability,” An-
drews said.

The operational changes suggested by An-
drews would require monthly progress
reports from all students involved on commit-'
tees and abolish executive sessions that are
closed to the public.

Andrews said he is “relatively confident”
the ABS will consider his report. ABS Presi-
dent Michael Suarez ’82 — although not in
favor of every measure — said the paper’s
“greatest merit is that it will stimulate
discussion, criticism and suggestions from
the ABS and outside groups. It can only help
the ABS.”

Dean of Student Affairs John Dunlop, who
sponsored Andrews’ project as a Jan Plan
and is also the ABS advisor, called the pro-
posal ‘‘a good one,” although ‘“‘that does not
necessarily mean I endorse everything in it.”

Aid and Admissions

questioned by faculty

An open meeting on the Univer-
sity’s Financial Aid and Admis-
sions policy was held Wednesday
in the University Center Forum
in response to the growing in-
terest of faculty and students in
the topic.

Director of Admissions
Richard Skelton and Director of
Financial Aid Ronald Laszewski
fielded questions from more than
20 students, faculty and ad-
ministrators regarding re-
cruiting methods, the athletic
talent grant program and the
general priorities of the Universi-
ty.

Responding to a question from
Assistant Professor of Physics
Stephen Becker, Laszewski said,
of the amount of the talent grants

pegged to athletics, close to 90
percent consists of direct grants
to offset the normal $1500 to $2200
self-help requirement. In
essence, Becker said, athletes
receiving talent grant aid are re-
quired to supply little if any of the
direct cost of their education.

In this light, Associate Pro-
fessor of Geology Edward Cotter
questioned if there was some way
the University could attract
academically motivated students
in addition to the ‘‘collegiate”’
types. Provost Wendell Smith
said it was not so much that
students are either ‘‘collegiate”’
or academically motivated—but
rather how the climate of the
campus shapes its students—that
is important.

on misconceptions about disabled

By LYNDA CHAPPELL and BILL THUM

Concern and Action, with funding from the ABS
Congress, is presenting a Handicap Awareness
Week beginning Monday to inform the community
of the problems and frustrations of the handi-
capped.

“Our goal is to open the doors, both physical and
attitudinal, that limit the handicapped in their
desire to live a normal life,” program coordinator
Karen Wark ’81 said. The activities are not de-
signed to evoke sympathy but rather increased
awareness, respect and understanding, Wark
said.

“Many of the events are specifically designed to
provide simulations of the limitations; including
physicial mobility, audio and visual, faced by the
handicapped daily,” Wark said. These simula-
tions will be coordinated by Sharon Woltz, who
received a Masters degree in Counseling and
Guidance from New York University. Woltz has
done extensive work in the field of the public’s at-
titudes toward the disabled person and believes
many limitations stem from the public’s own
misconceptions about the handicapped, Wark
said.

Also featured will be Michael Murphy, an assis-
tant to the Rev. Bruce Ritter — founder of crisis
centers for runaway teenagers and children. Mur-
phy will describe the life of these runaways and
describe his work with these children. Murphy
received his Bachelor’s degree in Social Service
from Fordham University and has worked both in

New York and Washington D.C.

Representatives of ARISE (Alternatives for
Reaching Independence through Services and
Engineering) will share their experiences as han-
dicapped people and suggest ways to function
without the limitations of one’s disabilities.
“Images,” a group of undergraduates from
Bloomsburg State College, will present a per-
formance on signing music. Through the use of
sign-language, the group will express the non-
verbal communication that is natural for the deaf.

Throughout the week there will be luncheon
discussions, lectures, films, displays and enter-
tainment including mouthpainting and a
children’s puppet show.

Work on the program began in September, when
Wark began to formulate goals and contact par-
ticipants. ‘‘Although Bucknell is beginning to
make physical improvements to provide easy ac-,
cess for the disabled, many attitudinal barriers
exist here and in our society which thwart the han-
dicapped person’s integration into the community,
Wark said.

If we can make an effort to break these barriers,
a whole new world will be opened to a large part of
the community,” Wark said.

The United Nations has-recognized discrimina-
tion toward the disabled and declared 1981 the
Year of the Handicapped. “Hopefully, the
week will increase the awareness and understand-
ing both on campus and in our lives and enable us
to accept the handicapped as equals,” Wark said.

Journalists query Kuralt
during press conference

By MATT KARANIAN

A handful of journalists turned the tables on Charles Kuralt in the
University Center Wednesday, putting the CBS News Correspondent
on the receiving end of a field of questions during a press conference in
the faculty lounge.

The reporters represented three regional newspapers, two local
radio stations, and a television station.

Kuralt said he felt uncomfortable in such a role reversal position,
and added that there is ‘“‘something vaguely wrong with journalists
becoming stories themselves. te

When CBS anchorman Walter Cronkite retired ‘“‘you’d have thought
the presidency was changing,” he said. It is easy for a journalist to
think of himself as “important,” and Kuralt said this is not desirable.

He recalled being advised ‘“‘just because you have a loud voice, don’t
let that make you think you’re any smarter than when your voice only
went as far as across the bar.”

Kuralt said at the conference that Lewisburg would “‘of course”’
have been a good location for a story when he was producing ‘‘On the
Road” for CBS. He said he recalled spending a night in Lewisburg dur-
ing his travels throughout America, but said that he never actually did
astory here.

“You could close your eyes and stick a pin in a map and find a story
of the type of irrelevance” that was covered for ‘‘On the Road,”’ he
said.

One reporter asked Kuralt his stand on nuclear energy during the
conference. Kuralt hesitated for a moment, and then refused to offer
his opinion. ‘‘I don’t express my opinions” he said, adding that he tries
to ‘‘keep objective.”

Kuralt fielded questions from a group of about 50 students during a
subsequent ‘“‘open classroom” in the U.C.Forum Wednesday morning.
The “open classroom” discussion was informal and lasted for two
hours.

Traveling across the nation for
“On the Road,” Kuralt said that
most of the time he didn’t know
where he was, but that he didn’t
care. “We were trying to spread
a little understanding of this
country. We were trying to un-
derstand ourselves.”

When asked to comment on the
“American character,” Kuralt
said nearly anything one says
about America is true. ‘“The land
and people are so rich and varied

that the character is different
from place to place.”

The country, however, is
changing for the better, ac-
cording to Kuralt, and “the
citizens can be appealed to.”

ing Sigma Chi raise money but thinks the derby chase, skits and house
decorations do not accomplish that end. “We don’t want to eliminate
all events that don’t raise money but do want to cut out those that are
harmful to the participants,” she said.

Zacune said the ‘initial reaction at the house was negative toward
the letter we received which mentioned a boycott. However, many
brothers didn’t even know the actual content of the letter.

“Sigma Chi has been receptive to the compromises we've reached
so far. There’s been no opposition from Sig concerning the changes,”
he said.

According to Collett, ‘‘A lot of brothers were reluctant to change at
first, but the compromise that has been reached is a good one.
Everyone saw the reality of the situation.”

Campbell said there “will be as many different opinions con-
cerning the revisions as there are members of Panhell,” and asserted
it is difficult to say whether the revisions are ‘‘significant.”’

When asked about a rumor that Sigma Chi did not raise enough
money last year to send a contribution to Wallace Village, Zacune said
he didn’t know how much money was donated last year and that there
was no way of getting the information because last year’s Sig Derby
chairman had graduated.

Zacune said the contribution is not the net profit made from the
week’s activities. ‘We don’t cover our costs in Sig Derby.”

Serves as an “‘intercessionary”’
between the University and the
NRC. It was Harclerode, there-
fore, who first received word of
the NRC’s eased regulations and
who subsequently proposed the
University act to take advantage
of the greater leeway allowed.

Harclerode said the Biology de-

the University of $2,000.

The amounts of radioactivity
involved are “infinitesimally
small” and would pose no threat
if burned here, he said, asserting
that there is a greater risk trans-
porting them.

If a decision to burn the matter
here is reached, it is a “possi-

not be used, Zeller said.

Zeller said although it would be
“more inconvenient and expen-

not be ‘“‘worth fighting the battle”

saw Pact forces had virtually
halted.

Officials said no combat forces
are apparent outside their gar-
risons in the Western parts of the
Soviet Union, in East Germany or
in Czechoslovakia.

Despite these indications—and
in order to remind the Soviet
Union that it intends to monitor
the situation carefully—the
Reagan Administration has
decided to react very cautiously.

Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger told reporters Tues-
day the Soviet Union must
remove its military forces from
around Poland before there could
be negotiations over arms control

Levesque and Parti

Quebecois re-elected

Premier Rene Levesque and
his Parti Quebecois were re-
elected in legislative elections in
Montreal Tuesday, and the vic-
tory was celebrated by those na-
tionalists who support an in-
dependent Quebec.

The Parti Quebecois gained 80
of 122 seats in Quebec’s National
Assembly Tuesday while the pro-
vincial Liberal Party won only 42

seats. :

The voters who gave Pierre
Elliott Trudeau’s Liberal Party
74 of 75 seats in the House of Com-
mons last year have now given
Trudeau’s strongest adversary,
the Parti Quebecois, the majority
of seats in the National
Assembly. The Parti Quebecois’
victory Tuesday was a rebound
from its overwhelming defeat
last year in a referendum on in-
dependence.

Washington Post
gives up Pulitzer

An article on an eight-year-old
heroin addict that had won the
Washington Post a 1981 Pulitzer
Prize has been revealed as a
fabrication, the Post announced
Wednesday.

The newspaper said it was
relinquishing the award and that
Janet Cooke, the 26-year-old
reporter who had written the
story, had resigned. A Post editor
said she confessed shortly after
the Pulitzer awards were an-
nounced that her eyewitness ac-
counts of ‘‘Jimmy’s World” — as
the piece was called — were
false.

Tt was the first time in the
history of the competition that an
award had been declined for such
a reason, Pulitzer prize board of-
ficials said. They also announced
that a reporter for The Village
Voice would be recognized in-
stead.

Mark Felt, who was the se-
cond highest official in the
bureau, and Edward Miller, who
was chief of the intelligence divi-
sion, had authorized Government
agents to break into homes in
search of antiwar radicals in the
early 1970s.

Reagan said the officials had

Although the normal procedure
is for a defendant to apply for a
pardon, Felt and Miller had not
formally applied. White House of-

itiated by the White House.

Prospective ABS officers present their

Students will be voting Tuesday for
officers and 8 members-at-large

University students go to the polls Tuesday to vote for ABS members-at-large and
sophomore, junior, senior and alumni class officers.

Voting tables will be open in the uphill and downhill lobbies of the University Center
from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., and results of the voting will be announced outside the ABS offices
on the ground floor of the UC at 11 p.m. that night.

Each class will be electing a president, vice president and secretary/treasurer to
organize the class. In addition, the present seniors will choose someone to edit their
reunion book. All students will pick eight of 13 candidates running for at-large seats on
the ABS Congress — the only voting members of the body other than the Steering

Committee chosen by all undergraduates.

In addition to serving in the congress, members-at-large also sit with the Steering
Committee on the Student Appropriations Committee, the group responsible for
allocating funds from next year’s $52 activities fee paid by each student

Candidates were requested to provide statements for publication, and those
statements are included on the following two pages. Candidates for whom statements are

not published failed to supply them to the Buc!

At-large

Rashid Ashraf

Being the member of the ABS for the past three years
(two years as ABS member-at-large) and having gained
a great deal of experience, I am again running for this
position in order to carry on your representation in ABS.
With the time and interest that I have, I am willing to do
the job if you are willing to show your support.

Todd Buchholz

David Grossman

During my past year as Kress dormitory represen-
tative in the ABS, I have realized the importance that the
ABS Congress and its members have in the Bucknell
community. The experience I have gained in this position
has been immeasurable, as I have had an opportunity to
witness and take part in the functioning of an active stu-
dent legislative body; realizing and acting upon the con-
cerns and needs of my constituents, while also doing my
best to contribute to the ABS as a whole body to benefit
the University and its students. As a member-at-large, I
will have to perform much in the same way that I have
this year, yet with an even larger number of constituents.
I feel that my sense of responsibility, commitment to
acknowledging and enforcing the concerns of the student
body, and the experience I have acquired during the past
year in the ABS make me a well-qualified candidate for
this position.

Mark Hower

Iam seeking this position, not only for the place I will
hold on the ABS Congress, but more importantly because
my responsibilities will include membership on the Stu-
dent Appropriations Committee. I frequently attend
many events on campus and I have noticed that, in
general, students are apathetic about the majority of
them. This seems to indicate that the activities available
are not fulfilling the desires of the students. In the
capacity of member-at-large, I would seek to remedy
this situation by allocating money to the budget so it will

execute our best interests. I feel my concern about using

knellian.

student activities as an important aspect of your educa-
tion and mine denotes I have the desire to carry out the
responsibilities of this position.

Daniel Huck

The main qualification for member-at-large necessari-
ly is experience with student government and student ap-
propriations. The members-at-large are unique in being
responsible to the total student body. To step into such a
job without the necessary experience and information is
hard. As freshman president, I have served this year as
a member of the ABS Congress. I have grown from an
observer to a participator, and now to an initiator as
well. While analyzing and constructing legislation in the
Congress, I have gotten to know its workings and its
members. Since February I have also served as a
member-at-large, the position which I now seek. In this
capacity, I have learned the operations of the Appropria-
tions Committee. I have acted in the past, and I will act in
the future, through legislation or comment, on issues
concerning student and community life at Bucknell.

Michael Kaye

One’s education lies far beyond the classroom. In this I
imply that an education is so much more than just study-
ing, in that learning is a product of all the activities that
we pursue. The campus community provides the op-
portunity for intellectual, social, cultural and athletic ex-
perience. It is by taking advantage of all these op-
portunities that a student receives a unique education.
For the past three years I have been involved in various
campus activities, and now in the face of accusations of
student apathy, I feel it is about time something be done.
Remember, Bucknell can be more than just conventional
learning. We must make students realize this. I think
that by working with the ABS I can help do this.

Christina Kounelias

The reason I am seeking the office of member-at-large
is because I have a sincere interest in the way money is
appropriated to the student budget and to the various stu-
dent organizations. It is necessary that this money is ac-
counted for properly and that the organizations involving
and affecting the most students get sufficient funding.
This is especially important since this money is
generated from every student. I feel that I am aware of
general student opinion and I will do my best to see that it
is made known to the ABS. Please help me to help repre-
sent you.

“CLASS OF ‘84: (I. to r.) Helayne Sherman, Bob Fessler, Steve Garfinkel

and Susan Stanley.

ee EU UUEEEEUUESUE NESE ERE

Susan MacDonald

Oh yeah, ABS elections. The table set up near the UC
entrances that you glance at but continue walking faster.
After all, it’s not going to affect you. “The ABS never
does anything anyway.” Despite the popularity of these
beliefs, ABS does not stand for Apathetic Bucknell
Students. Remember scholarships and talent grants? Or
how about the Appropriations Committee which doles out
the money for student organizations? But why vote for
me? Don’t worry, I’m not going to recite every office I
held during my senior year in high school or list every ac-
tivity I’ve attended since my arrival here a year and a
half ago. I will say that I have served on ABS for the past
semester. I can’t promise you that my presence is going
to change the world, but I am willing to devote my time
and concern to the job.

Edward Mastascusa

Hank Schreiner

Helayne Sherman

The ABS Congress needs members who are open to
suggestions from the student body. I am interested in
promoting organizations on campus that students have
expressed an interest in. As an ABS member, I will work
hard to coordinate activities that respond effectively to
the needs of the students. I am a member of the Dining
Service Committee and one of my jobs is to represent the
students’ suggestions and work toward a more organized
system. Active student involvement is imperative for
success. For a more effective representation of student
opinion, vote for me.

Bill Thum

After attending ABS meetings for years without the
status of a voting member, and being frustrated in acti-
vities by the lack of knowledge demonstrated by the Ap-
propriations Committee, I have decided once again to
seek your support for my election. My knowledge and
sensitivity to activities at Bucknell has been gained
through three years of positive work on University com-
mittees, special campus events, student organizations
and the campus news media. I would like to use this ex-
perience to both rejuvenate the ABS and legitimatize the
Appropriations Committee. Bucknell has a lot of poten-
tial that is waiting to be discovered. It is going to take
those with experience and caring if change is to come. As
member-at-large, I would work to see this potential
realized.

David Tyler

Sophomore

President
Bob Fessler

I have two clear-cut objectives for our class: to
establish a permanent Sophomore Advisory Council and
to increase our treasury. Freshman year was a time to
adjust to our new environment. As sophomores, we must
consolidate our class and lay the groundwork for our
future years. Establishing a Sophomore Advisory Coun-
cil open to all concerned, hard-working class members
would enable anyone to voice his opinion and guide our
course. The committee would help plan and implement

our projects. This plan will tap the leadership potential in
many class members. By increasing our treasury
through on and off-campus fund-raisers (movies, flower
sales, car washes), our future years will be secure and
enjoyable. My two proposed goals if executed will unite
our class, assure smooth control and pave a path to three
successful years for the Class of ’84.

Steve Garfinkel

During the past year, I have held the position of
treasurer of the freshman class. Through this position I
have learned much concerning the working of student
government at Bucknell. My reasons for running are
many. Primarily, I wish to serve the class; I am con-
cerned with what goes on at Bucknell. I seek the
challenge of the office; I want to do the job. I will not
hesitate to voice your views and concerns in open forums
of the ABS. I look forward to a year filled with social ac-
tivities. I will publish a monthly newsletter keeping you
informed. I intend to invite people to work with the class
officers on various projects through class meetings. I did
a good job as treasurer and I feel that I can do a better
job as president. A vote for me is a vote for experience
and accomplishment.

Vice President

Scott Hoerrner

My first reason for running is the enjoyment I get from
working with others. As class vice president for the first
semester, I was given the chance to work closely with
others and I found I would like to continue this. Another
reason I have for seeking is the sense of accomplishment
I get from seeing things done right. As vice president, I
was able to blend my ideas with those of others to un-
cover the best possible alternatives. A third reason I
have for campaigning is school pride. Bucknell is a
school long in tradition, and while vice president I would
do my utmost to carry on this tradition of achievement.
Putting it all into one line, I would say the vice-
presidency is a job I want to do, a job I hope I have
proven I can do, and a job I hope you—the class of ’84—
will continue to let me do.

Sec.-Treas.

Helayne Sherman

The position of secretary/treasurer carries with it
much responsibility and it requires experience as wellas
unlimited dedication from a hard-working individual. I
am treasurer of the Hillel Organization and the treasurer
of Bucknell Alliance Against Apartheid, and I believe I
am well-qualified for this position. I am willing to listen
to your suggestions and see that they are represented at
class meetings. Your involvement is an integral part of
our class success and I urge you to speak out and be
heard. I will contribute enthusiasm, dedication and new
ideas to pull our class together. Vote for me and help our
class realize its potential.

Susan Stanley

There are several reasons why I am seeking this posi-
tion. After having been an active ABS Congress member
as Roberts dorm representative during my first year
here, I continue to feel the urge to act as a communica-
tion link between students, faculty, administration and
the ABS Congress. There is a strong need for class unity.
In order to help obtain this unity, I am interested in hear-
ing your ideas, researching them and taking action upon
them with my co-workers. Your vote for me would be a
positive move toward a more cohesive class and reward-
ing experience at Bucknell.

Junior

President

Lon Castle

If I ever run across the phrase ‘‘class government” on
a word association test, I would probably write “pizza
study break.” This may sound unfair, but after almost

two years at Bucknell I cannot think of a single class- §

sponsored activity other than some type of study break.
To me, the function of a class government is to promote
diverse social activities. For example, there is a general
social lag in September before fraternities begin rush. I
propose the classes, either collectively or individually,
hold some sort of all campus event during this time —
possibly a band party — to fill this void. Most important-
ly, I believe that a poll should be conducted among our
junior class to determine what social alternatives there
should be. After all, since each individual contributes to
the class fund, they should have a say in how this money
is spent.

Barbara Fedele

As secretary/treasurer of the Class of '83 for two
years, I have become quite familiar with class activities
— both social and fund raising. In the past two years, I
have coordinated various kinds of study breaks co-
headed the sophomore pre-football game ‘‘munches”
and I am currently co-organizing a baseball cap sale to
benefit the Area Agency on the Aging. The office of class
president is a position dealing primarily with planning
social events for the class and fostering class unity, as
well as being a voting member of the ABS Congress and
the Committee on Student Programs. Why do I want to be
president of the Class of ’83? Because in two years Thave
dealt with many social events. Because in two years I
have gotten to know many members of my class and
always try to promote class unity. Because in two years I
have gained the experience needed to perform the job
well.

George Tsougarakis

The official description of the office of president says
that the president’s main functions are the planning of
social events and the fostering of class unity, but these
aren’t the reasons that I want to be president. I feel that
the job should be more than that of a social chairman. As
a member of the ABS, he should try to make our class
play an important role in student government as a whole.
Furthermore, the president should be more than just a
figurehead. For example, how many of you know who our
current officers are? A surprisingly large number of
students have no idea and this is not only the fault of the
officers, but it is also due to the apathy present among
students. Therefore, everyone should try to vote and, if
I’m elected, I'll do my best to let everyone know who I
am and what I’m doing.

Vice President
Anne Maher

The reason I am seeking class office is that I would like
to work to develop a spirit of unity in our class. I believe

CLASS OF '82: (I. to r.) David Flinchbaugh, Nancy Weaver, Mike Palumbo,

that the office of vice president can be an important one
in planning and instituting activities of common interest
to the class. These activities, such as study breaks and
pre-game get-togethers (after all, who’s not interested in
food?) provide a way for the members of our class to
maintain ties with one another while pursuing their
diverse interests. If elected, I would try to increase the
participation of class members in the activities planned
and look for new ideas for class projects of interest to
everyone. As vice president, I would put enthusiastic ef-
fort into my duties and would be dedicated to maintain-
ing the spirit of the Class of 83.

Sec.-Treas.
Gail Post

Class government serves the student body as mainly a
social outlet. This past year as vice president, I worked
with the other officers and the advisory committee to
provide the sophomore class with numerous study
breaks: pizza, cookies & donuts and ice cream sundaes.
We also held two fall pre-game munchie parties. As a
class we are continuing a fund raising project for the
“Area Agency on Aging” in Lewisburg. Also, united
class officers work together to hold all-campus functions
such as year-end band parties. I wish to continue my ef-
forts next year in the office of secretary/treasurer. I feel
Ihave the leadership experience as a current officer and
the business experience after working for three summers
in the accounting department of a small firm in New
Jersey. The experience and motivation of all the future
officers should make for an excellent junior year.

Senior

David Flinchbaugh

After two years as class vice president, I've experi-
enced first-hand all the road blocks and detours that can
turn the best laid plans into a pile of rubble. But through
all the campaigns, meetings, study breaks and parties,
I’ve come to know the Class of '82 as an energetic group
who can overcome most any obstacle. This year, Ken,
Luanne and I have tried to build a strong foundation.
We've increased the number and scope of activities, in-
creased our ABS funding and increased class participa-
tion. Therefore, for our senior year, the plans will be big-
ger, the obstacles fewer and the successes constant. I see
our class following many of the great senior traditions,
but also creating a few traditions of our own. It will take
lots of people and lots of work, but it’s our senior year,
and together we can make it the best.

David Hawkings

Ina class president, I think the Class of 82 should have
someone who knows the personality and the personalities
of the class, who knows what we want for an enjoyable
senior year, who knows the ways to get the class what it
wants and who can represent the views of the group as
*82’s only voting member of the ABS Congress and COSP.
That’s a tough order to fill, and I won’t presume to say I
can easily fill it. But I think I know most of you and your
desires for senior year. And I’m confident in my
knowledge of the workings of the University after serv-
ing on the Bucknellian, two University committees and
the board of trustees(as a student delegate.) Td like the
opportunity to put this knowledge to work for what I
would hope would be the benefit of all seniors next year.

Mike Palumbo

Amajor criticism of the Bucknell campus is its inabili-
ty to adequately provide enjoyable and original social
alternatives for its students. By senior year many view
the typical frat party scene as inadequate in either
stimulating new friendships or expanding community
awareness. The Bull Run Inn (the not so famous bar and
grill) becomes the dominant community social center for
relaxation, but as yet I have not heard many positive or
extremely excited opinions of the “senior haven.” As
president, one of my primary objectives would be to
foster alternative social and community events that will
hopefully take advantage of both the wealth of the Buf-
falo Valley and its senior Bucknell students. Therefore, I
am asking for your support so I may have the opportuni-
ty to help initiate these alternatives for the Class of ’82.

Vice President

Luanne Savino

On Wednesday, you will have the opportunity to vote
for your senior class officers. These individuals will
serve the Class of ’82 in its final year at Bucknell. Their
endeavors will serve to unify the class through the senior
year traditions and toward graduation. This year as
junior class secretary/treasurer, I have worked with
Ken Wolckenhauer, Dave Flinchbaugh and the Junior
Class Advisory Committee to provide the class with
festivities and events such as the Apple Festival and the
good ole’ pizza study breaks. The three of us have also
worked as part of united class government to sponsor all-
campus events. Please, make a choice and vote. It’s your
chance to determine your senior year.

statements

Sec.-Treas.

Nancy Weaver

Most people are familiar with the office of secretary/
treasurer as a relatively insignificant position. But what
is generally overlooked is that this position is one of
responsibility and essential for an effective class govern-
ment. My active participation during the past three
years as a chairman of a CA committee, Dorm Council
representative, member of the Class of ’82 Advisory
Councils and most significantly as an ABS represen-
tative has given me valuable experience with University
government from the “inside.” Moreover, I possess the
drive and willingness to effectively fulfill the duties of
secretary/treasurer while representing you.As an in-
tegral informatory link between you and the class
government, I will attempt to make our senior class
government more action-oriented and more responsive
to your needs.

Alumni

President

Eric Hoerner

I have been involved in many extracurricular ac-
tivities during my years at Bucknell. After graduation, I
would like to actively contribute to and participate in my
alma mater, hence my desire for the position of alumni
class president. An active and interested group of alumni
will be a vital part of Bucknell’s future, and I would like
to lead our class’ part of that group.

Vice President
Ray Monasterski

It seems that too many of us have the perception of the
“alum” as one who performs the perfunctory duty of
donating money to the University and doing little of
anything else. Being alumni vice-president of the Class of
°81 would allow me to do more than just give money and
perhaps change the traditional perception of the func-
tions of an “alum.” Clearly, the alumni constitute a vast
medium which can actively aid in implementing the im-
provements needed in certain areas at Bucknell other
than Annual Giving. In addition to serving on the Alumni
Board of Directors with the president, my other duty
would be to plan the reunion socials. In this capacity, I
feel I have the knowledge necessary to make our reu-
nions events which would produce fond memories of the
days of yore.

Sec.-Treas.

Carol Christie

Book Editor

Beth Battin

Asa future alumna, I wish to remain involved in the ac-
tivities of the Bucknell community. I desire to spend wor-
thwhile time working with the Alumni Office in prepar-
ing the Class of 1981 Reunion Book. During January of
this year and earlier this semester, I was involved,
together with another senior, in writing a public relations
brochure on the historical aspects of the buildings on the
Bucknell campus. This was a challenging and rewarding
experience in which I learned much about the origin and

Neglect and waste

The problem with the disposal of nuclear waste is that it can
never really be disposed of. The wastes may be buried, burned or
poured down the kitchen sink, but they’ll still exist here on Earth.
We are faced with the question of whether it is more desirable to
burn the matter here, or to transport it for burial elsewhere.

The NRC doesn’t think burning the matter will pollute our at-
mosphere significantly. The radioactivity — although of sufficient
magnitude to require transportation by licensed carrier and isolated
burial 3,000 miles from here — should not prove harmful. Professor
of Biology Jack Harclerode, who incidentally is also a Nuclear
Regulatory Officer, agrees with the NRC.

What is needed now is some open discussion on this matter. The
Bucknell Progressive Caucus has petitioned members of the Ad-
ministration and the Biology department for an “educational panel
discussion” to be held to inform students and area residents of the
implications of incineration of radioactive matter here.

This is the proper approach. The decisions of a handful of
University officials could effect all of us, and it only makes sense
that we be informed on this matter. t :

We therefore urge Harclerode and others in the administration
to honor the Caucus’ request for information. Only then can we make
an intelligent decision about the merits of allowing radioactive
fumes to fly over Lewisburg.

New fashions

Every year since we’ve been here, bowler hats have come into
fashion at just about this time of the spring. We've never really
understood the phenomenon: freshman women suddenly disappear
from the Bison and the library one day; by the next afternoon,
they’re running and squealing like banshees as they chase after men
in the strange black hats we all know as Sig Derbies.

We don’t know what all the fuss is about, anyway. Though ap-
parently for a worthy charity, the Sigma Chi’s in the hats do not
know the monetary worth generated by the weekend event. And
though former and current sorority pledges say they chase after the
hats and glorify those wearing them for fun and to promote sisterly
unity, we’ve seen too many wounded physically in Derby combat
and mentally by derby sexism.

We hope the compromises affected recently by the Panhellenic
Council and the brothers of Sigma Chi temper the zealousness of the
chase and the outlandishness of the treatment of those doing the
chasing. These compromises are in our eyes long overdue, and we’re
glad both the men and the women involved in this situation have
seen their felicity better late than never.

It will be refreshing to have a different spring fashion this year.

Prescription Philled

Here’s a line you’ve heard before, and that you'll read again in
one form or another if you look back at our two pages of candidate
statements: ‘‘It’s time to get the ABS working again.”

There’s an air of disillusionment in those paragraphs about the
institution the candidates wish to become a part of, but very few
students have in the past taken much time to think about the
disenchantment, and the institution which has appeared to foster it.
And no one had taken the time to force people to think about the
congress — and then to combine all these thoughts into some in-
sightful and sensitive suggestions for ways to improve it — other
than Phil Andrews.

As a former president of our student government, Andrews has
not been idling in academe. Instead, he spent his January chatting
with everyone from Dennis O’Brien to a former Swartz Dorm
Council president about ABS. And most of his conclusions make
sense to us. The emphasis his restructured congress would put on
representation through academic department affiliation could
perhaps do much to shift what some people here observe as an old-
time “collegiate” social attitude into a more academic and
progressive one.

The opinion of Phil’s efforts that counts most is not ours in the
end, though; it is the ABS’s. Perhaps the most valuable task the
Suarez Administration will undertake is a long, hard look at itself;
we hope they are as up for the task as the leader of the old Andrews
Administration was.

Truth doesn't belong to
BPC—who does own it?

By Jim Castle

Since the beginning of the
Bucknell Progressive Caucus,
there have been countless inter-
changes on the validity of certain
stands the BPC takes. This is all
well and good.

The BPC does not claim to own
the truth; rather it claims to
question that which we have all
taken for granted as the truth.
When we question any opinion we
admit to being part of this ques-
tioning process. Why, then, is
there so much acrid criticism in
the form of massive generaliza-
tions about the group and its
stands?

It is the result of those who
think they own the truth, those
who claim to know the reasoning
and political beliefs of all the
BPC members and those that are
fearful of the opinions of others.

I am a BPC member. A
member and that is all. I do not
claim to stand for anyone but

myself. I could not even begin to
describe what the ideology of the
BPC is, because it does not have
one that can be written into stone.
It is true that we share interests
but not a universal doctrine.

I invite all those omniscient
critics who know what the BPC is
to our meetings. Because then
they will know what questioning
is and how little truth one can
claim to know.

As far as those who criticize in-
dividual issues are concerned, I
must encourage them to vocalize
their disagreement. But to write
off an entire group of people as
pure idealists, communists, arm-
chair liberals, marxists, or
whatever favorite generalism is
at hand would be — to me —
among the greatest of sins.

I cannot call Keith B. Ritter im-
moral for claiming that war is a
part of human nature and that we
should bring a piece of it to
Bucknell.

I cannot claim that the L’Agen-
da folks are all racists because of

Houseman: classy, credible and always a gentleman

By Todd G. Buchholz

“A gentleman is one who never hurts
anyone’s feelings unintentionally.”

I think I read this quotation on a Salada
teabag in the Bostwick cafeteria. Using
this definition, there is no better example
of a gentleman than John Houseman, who
visited Bucknell last month. A rather
classy and credible man, Houseman spoke
of theater and acting when he addressed a
capacity crowd at Rooke Chapel March 13.

In an interview, though, he revealed a
pointed and pithy tongue. Dressed in a
tweed jacket and a polka-dot bowtie, the
man who created the role of Professor
Kingsfield for ‘‘The Paper Chase’
reflected on his half-century of experience
in American entertainment.

“Did you ever work with President
Reagan when he was in the acting
business?” I asked.

“Heavens no. In those days I was a
producer and he certainly would not be
an actor I would have hired under any
circumstances. He just wasn’t a, you
know, he was a very routine, uninspired
actor. That’s alright, there’s nothing
wrong with that.”

Houseman—speaking slowly
authoritatively in the British accent he has
maintained despite living in the United
States for nearly 60 of his 79 years —
compared the filmmakers of today with
the moguls of earlier years.

Did the moguls have a more artistic
notion behind their work?

“Not so much artistic as professional.
They had been in the business for years;
they loved it. It was all they knew. Today
nobody is concerned with making pictures.
They’re concerned with finding a block-
buster, and they’re concerned with
money.”

Houseman’s opinion of television
executives was even less enthusiastic —
which was not surprising, considering
“The Paper Chase’’ had been cancelled by
NBC a few years ago for poor ratings.

What type of people control television?

“Well, you know. They’re in it for profit.
There are bright guys there; there are
greedy guys there. There are scared guys
there. And there is an awful lot of big
money, and when big money is there,
everyone behaves rather sordidly.”’

According to the actor-director, a lack of

good writers plagues the television in-
dustry.
“There’s a lot of bad stuff being written.
The whole problem with television is a
very serious one, because the amount of
material that television chews up every 24
hours is vast. So what you get is a lot of
very hack material with a lot of repetition,
a lot of doing what was successful last
week. ‘Let’s doit again.’”

Do people like Rona Barret and Rex
Reed know what they’re talking about?

“you know, they’re not dummies. They
get inside information, nothing very hard
or sensational, but enough to keep them
occupied.”

Do you read your reviews?

© YOURE STILL OH YES Hl MARY

“Sure, always — everybody reads
reviews. If they say they don’t, they’re
liars. But you read them because they

affect the box office, not really because

THE
BUCH

STOP

NN
you’re interested in what the critic has to

say. But the critic does still to a lesser
degree affect your box office, so you damn
well read them.”

Houseman enunciates words like ‘‘dum-
mies” and “liars.” They ooze forth like the
final verdict of a British king, and it is this
delivery which gives his Smith-Barney
advertisements their credibility.

“J was delighted to do them . . . they’ve
been very, very successful. The day before
yesterday I was at a reception with the
head of one of the big, big, big oil com-
panies. He said, ‘I’m afraid I have to
confess to plagiarism when I addressed my
executives from all over the world. I said I
can only quote from television: ‘We make
money the old fashioned way — we earn
tase

“T’m sure his reading was not as good as
mine,”’ Houseman added.

Atrue gentleman, indeed.

Festival excellent desp1

Well rounded view of art

received with enthusiasm

By ALLISON ABOUCHAR

Despite a threatened appearance by the
Ku Klux Klan, last weekend’s Black Arts
Festival was successful, according to
Admissions Counselor and Minority
Recruiter Zanthia Conway, who coor-
dinated the event.

“The Klan caused me a great deal of
concern, but I was pleased with the way
the University responded. Though the
threat was negative in the beginning, I
think it helped give the festival publicity
and create more interest among the
community. It was actually a unifying
force that worked for us,” she said.

Former president of the Black Student
Alliance Kevon Makeli ’81 also said the
weekend went ‘exceptionally well.”

“T don’t think we can deny the Klan their
constitutional rights to solicit membership
in Lewisburg, but their presence would
have had an influence on the prospective
students,” Makell said.

Conway said she was “pleased with the
turnout from the white community. There
was a full house at most every event and I
hope the support continues.”

Twenty-four prospective black students
spent the weekend and ‘“‘seemed to have
enjoyed themselves. Many confided to
upperclassmen that they would like to
come here next September,” she said.

The committee for the festival met
regularly for about two and a half months
to span the events, according to Conway.

The festival began April 9 with a lecture
by Sylvia Arden Boone accompanied by
slides illustrating ‘Ideas and Beauty in
African Art.” The Labor Theater gave a
well-received performance of “Railroad
Bill,” the story of a trin robber who
became the legendary “Black Jesse
James” of his day, through robbing
railroad cars and distributing the money
to poor farmers throughout the West.

One highlight of the festival, a presen-
tation of b.f. maiz, was recipitated by an

impromptu meeting with the poet in the
University Center Forum April 9 focusing
on the issue of the then - planned visit of
the KKK Saturday. Maiz said the group
should be allowed to speak on the basis of
the First Amendment of the Constitution,
which was read aloud at the discussion.
“May I Poet With You?’”’, maiz’s
presentation Friday evening, was an in-
tense recitation of poems composed and
memorized by the poet. Walking about as
he spoke, maiz prefaced many of his
poems with short stories explaining the
source of his inspiration for the piece.
While most of the poems were serious,
there were several humorous works which
broke the otherwise silent atmosphere in

the Forum, which held a standing - room -

ovation at the end of the presentation.

At “Job Opportunities for Young
Blacks,” presented Saturday morning by
John Smith of the U.S. Committee on
Labor and Education, Smith presented a
variety of resources for employment
possibilities after graduation from
Bucknell.

The workshop concerning ‘“‘Law in the
80s,” led by Norma Brown °77 and Will
Traylor ’73 Saturday afternoon, fulfilled
two goals. In addition to integrating
alumni participation in the festival, the
informative session focused on prospec-
tive students and freshmen.

Though the show was started late, the

in ‘Ephemeris’ acting recital

By LYNNE RUTHERFORD

Senior actors Barry Fishel and Patrick Pedro will
team for the first acting recital presented here in
five years at 8:30 p.m. Wednesday in the University
Center Cave. The program — entitled
“Ephemeris” — is sponsored jointly by Cap and
Dagger and the Association for the Arts.

Pedro and Fishel, both management majors, have
each undertaken a wide variety of roles during their
four years here. Fishel, seen most recently as the
Stage Manager of “Our Town,” views the recital as
a way of “trying to extend myself in different direc-
tions.”

“In acting here, I’ve learned a lot about myself
and other people,” he said.

“For me, acting fulfills a need. It’s a form of self-
expression, a way of getting to know myself better
and getting to know other people,” said Pedro, who
has appeared this year in “Tartuffe,” “A Funny
Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum,” and
“Our Town.”

The two began selecting their pieces for this
recital in January and have been working steadily
on their presentation ever since. The recital is an in-
dependent project advised by Professor of English
and Theater Harvey Powers.

Although several directors, including Powers,
have been consulted by the actors, most of the direc-
ting has come from the participants themselves.
For the technical aspects of the production, they
have drawn on many Cap and Dagger members for
assistance, especially Bruce Delaplane ’82 who
serves as Stage Manager for the project.

In addition, Gwyn English ’81, who appeared with
the two in “Our Town” and other productions, will
perform a scene with Pedro.

“These pieces deal with restlessness, uncertainty,
and growth. We want to demonstrate what we’ve
gotten out of acting here and push ourselves in dif-
ferent directions,” said Fishel, who plans to con-
tinue his acting career after graduation and has
been accepted at The Circle in the Square Reper-
tory Company in New York.

The individual pieces, actually short scenes from
longer works, have not been advertised on publicity
posters because it ‘“‘could be misleading,’ Pedro
said. He explained people might mistakenly come to
see a certain play, and then find that the produc-
tion is a combination of many scenes, one of which
is an original piece by Fishel.

“We want people to come for the recital itself,
not just to see particular pieces,” he said. .

Pedro, who will attend law school in the fall, add
“We want to entertain and affect all those who see
this recital.”

Although he is not directly pursuing an acting
career, Pedro plans to continue his theatrical in-
terests beyond graduation.

“Most people don’t realize how many Op-
portunities there are in theater, especially in the
summer. I want to participate as much as my time
permits,” he said.

Both actors say they were well prepared to con-
tinue in theater by their studies and experiences
here.

“The opportunities are here, but you have to take
advantage of them. I did not come here only to study
theater, although I was able to make it an important
part of my liberal arts education,” Fishel said.

“we've been lucky to get such a wide experience
here. In many other schools, non-theater majors
aren’t even permitted to act on stage,” Pedro said.

Virginia Beach performs “I Write the Songs” by The Captain and Tenille in her sign and

Beach performance carrl
moving and viva

By JESSICA WEICHSEL

“Magic to Do,” an original sign
and song show, was performed
Thursday evening in the
University Center Forum by
Virginia Beach, a deaf student
from Gallaudet College, the
national college for the deaf in
Washington, D.C.

Before an audience of 125
university students, deaf adults
and children from the Lewisburg
area, Beach danced and signed
the lyrics of various popular
songs while mouthing the words
so that members of the audience
able to read lips would also be
able to understand.

The program was preceded by
a short introduction in which she
thanked Concern and Action for
sponsoring her performance
here. In the distinctive speech of
a person who learned to talk
without hearing voices, Beach
said she would present “a visual
form of my music.” She ex-
plained that the music she hears

“comes not from outside but
from within.”

Beach then began with “Magic
To Do” from the popular
Broadway show “Pippin.” The
dancing and signing moved the
audience as Beach swayed and
clapped to help keep the beat.
Beach used her hands and body to
create a visual image of the
music she “hears.” She ex-
plained she does not hear music
with her ears, but with her heart.
She can feel the beat of the songs
and thus keeps time with the
lyrics.

Beach introduced her songs
with jokes and made an effort to
include the audience by teaching
them -the appropriate sign
language for “Sing”? by The
Carpenters. Each half of the
Forum audience learned a verse
of the song and joined her as she
mouthed the words. To add to her
performance of “Shop Around”
by the Captain and Tenille, Beach
led five men down from the

them. As she mimed and signed
the song, the audience laughed
and sang with her.

Throughout the evening her
speech was full of humor and her
attitude was light, though her
message was serious. Between
numbers, she signed eagerly to
children in the room who were
delighted by the presentation.

Beach, who is very open about
the differences between the
hearing and deaf worlds, said she
wishes to inspire an interest in
deaf people and sign language
here. This was her fifth visit here,
performing and visiting classes
each time. Her appearances are

Four girls selected as
next year's Sem Gems

The Sem Gems, Bucknell’s female barbershop quartet, an-
nounced this week the names of four new members, chosen during
auditions Saturday.

Carol Duncan ’82, Elisa Jo McKay 84, Carolyn Ripp ’84 and Rila
Yang ’82 will replace the current Sem Gems—seniors Melissa
Bodine, Karen Levine, Kris Olsen— and Jill Stranko for the rest of
the semester, but no performances are planned.

If the new singers are familiar enough with the songs, they may
join the others in the cafeteria on the afternoon of May 2 as part of
the Spring Weekend program, according to Levine, one of the
group’s original singers.

The current Sem Gems, in addition to teaching songs to the new
members, will be performing at the Lewisburg Federal Peniten-

Nationally-ranked teams beat laxmen

Laxmen lose third straight on

explosive start by Towson State

By KEN QUAAS

The list of the best lacrosse teams in the country is a poll of coaches
known as the “‘Top 15”’.

The Bucknell schedule includes four teams in this week’s poll of
those teams revered nationally, and this has been part of the problem
for the 2-5 Bisons.

While eighth-ranked Maryland dispatched the Bisons in the Loyola
Tournament over Spring Break and No. 10 Rutgers had the laxmen
notched on the victory column by the first period April 8, third-
ranked Syracuse invaded Lewisburg Saturday, nailing the Bisons,
13-7.

“We don’t just roll over and play dead,” Coach Sid Jamieson said,
“These schools have much bigger programs than we do. We have a
tougher schedule than anyone in the country with a program compar-
able to ours in scale.”

Senior Tri-Captain Jim Gilbert agreed with that assessment and
said, ‘‘For a program of our size, nobody plays a tougher schedule.”

In addition to the Rutgers and Maryland losses, the laxmen have
also been defeated by Loyola—no. 1 in Division IJ—and Towson
State, a squad ranked 14th in the Top 15.

Like Rutgers, Towson jolted the Bisons Wednesday with an early
flurry and had already assumed a comfortable 4-1 lead by the end
of the first period. In a normally high-scoring sport like lacrosse, a
three-goal lead does not mean it is time to relax. But an ineffective
offense—the Bisons are averaging eight goals per game—was able
to muster but four goals, and the Tigers prevailed, 9-4.

“Defensively we had a good day,” Jamieson said, “‘but when you’re
limited to four goals and don’t shoot the ball well, you can’t beat a
club like Towson.” The Bisons took 46 shots Wednesday, the same
number as Towson. And while the Tigers’ three goalies combined
for 22 saves, many Bucknell shots did not even come close to their
intended mark.

Towson’s defense was tenacious however, as Rink Smith’s unas-
sisted tallie—his first of two goals—in the first period was only
matched by hard-shooting Tri-captain John Morris’ ’82 two scores
in the second and third quarters.

Smith capped the Bucknell effort late in the fourth period after a
pass from Andy Fraser ’83 which caught the Tiger goalie off guard.

If the Towson match seemed cut and dry from the start, the Syra-
cuse contest stood in sharp contrast.

The Orangemen met an initially determined Bucknell group and
had it not been for a “‘team lapse,” as Gilbert called it, which al-
lowed Syracuse to pop in two quick tallies in the closing minutes of the
first half, the Bisons would have been on top of the nation’s third-
ranked team, 4-3.

As it was, the letdown cost the laxmen two goals and the lead, but
the close 5-4 halftime score was reverberated around campus and the
crowd—already large on the sunny Saturday afternoon—swelled with
considerable anticipation and intrigue.

But it was not the day for upsets. After the Bison scare, the Orange-
men “decided to get moving” said Jamieson. A 5-4 edge was methodi-
cally increased as Bucknell was outscored by its visitors, 8-3 in the
second half, jacking the final score up to 13-7.

According to Jamieson, ‘‘It wasn’t so much a failure on our part.
Syracuse moved the ball much better in the second half.’’ Gilbert
said “Syracuse sort of woke up in the second half and we got a little
jittery after the last two goals (of the first half)”’.

Both Jamieson and Gilbert expressed satisfaction with the Bison
defense in the last two games and thus far this season.

The laxmen held Towson to its lowest point total this season while
senior Tri-Captain Stu Berger recorded 22 saves in goal. Jamieson
called the keeper’s efforts against Towson “super’’, and defenseman
Gilbert was quick to agree. ‘‘Stu’s been a god for us,”’ he said.

Having passed through the most difficult portion of their schedule,
the Bisons stand ready to take on East Coast Conference foes Lafay-
ette, Lehigh and Drexel in their next three contests—a breather from
Top 15 competition.

Although both Berger and Gilbert agree that the primary focus of
the team is success within the conference, there exists an underlying
ambition to upend some of the Top 15 heat on the schedule.

“We've never beaten one of the Top 15 teams,” Gilbert said, ‘‘If we
can just knock one off, it’ll all be uphill from there.”

Jamieson said, ‘For us to play competitively with a Syracuse is a
feather in our cap. To win one of these would really boost the confi-
dence of our kids.” {

And, while an improved Lafayette squad hosts the laxmen tomor-
row, no. 12 Army looms in the near future (April 29) as another shot
at the Top 15.

checks her Slippery Rock opponent in the Bisons’ 8-6 loss

Wednesday. The two-goal loss was the Bisons’ second of the week, giving them an 0-5 record.

Triumphs elude lacrosse team

Perhaps the most frustrating way to lose a game
is by a close score.

If this is so, then you won’t have to teach the
women’s lacrosse team the meaning of the word
frustration. The Bisons have dropped all six of their
matches this Spring, but four of those five defeats
were by one or two goals.

Typical of this season’s misfortune was Wed-
nesday’s matchup with Slippery Rock in which the
Bisons were quickly stunned by three unanswered
tallies in the opening minutes of the first half. While
the score stood at 6-3 at the half, the Bisons out-
played their opponents in the second half, but the
laxwomen never recovered from the opening on-
slaught. After fighting from behind the entire game,
they eventually succumbed, 8-6.

“Tt was a tough game,” starter Jeanne Minahan
83 said, “We weren’t coming through on the
basics.” Indeed, the game was marked by sloppy
passing from both sides, but it was the Rock that
was finally able to take command and edge out a
victory.

Monday’s meeting with Colgate provided a
similar tale. The Red Raiders came to Lewisburg
determined to avoid the long ride home carrying a
loss, and a physical, defensive battle ensued. The
checking was ‘particularly rough” according to

Baseball tops Di

Minahan, and the end result saw Colgate on top, 4-3.

Just as the laxwomen were hurt by the initial
onslaught of Slippery Rock, a final flurry in the
waning minutes of the second half of the Colgate
duel resulted in Bucknell’s undoing.

Despite the stigma of an 0 slate, the Bisons have
made some improvements over last year in their
third season of varsity competition.

While they had notched a victory over Swar-
thmore, 10-4, by this time last year, a 17-8 loss to
perenially tough Shippensburg was improved
slightly by a 12-5 defeat this year. And, while
Franklin & Marshall dumped the laxwomen by a
score of 12-5 in last season’s campaign, the Bisons
held on throughout the afternoon in Saturday’s F&M
encounter, only to be turned back by a mere goal, 9-
8.

Similarly, the Lock Haven contest on April 7 was
encouraging, despite the final 4-3 Lock Haven edge.
“Holding them to four goals was quite an ac-
complishment”’ Minahan said.

While Coach Sally Starr was out of town and
unavailable for comment at press time, Minahan
outlined a bit of the laxwomen’s future strategy.

“As the coach has said, we’ve had some golden
and some disastrous moments,” Minahan said, “‘So
we're going to try to start the season over.”

Men’s tennis is stopped
by Rutgers and weather

By ROBERT BURNEY

The seriously depleted reservoirs in central Pennsylvania have
surely benefitted from the rain which has fallen this week, but
Coach Craig Reynolds can take little solace in that fact. His tennis
team has been hard pressed to get a match in since returning from
its Florida tour.

Last Thursday the rain halted the match against Bloomsburg
State midway through the first set. Faring no better were the Nit-
tany Lions of Penn State, whose stay in Lewisburg was marred by a
Tuesday washout.

In between, the Bucknell netters did manage to play one match,
bowing to Rutgers 81 at New Brunswick, N.J. on Saturday.
Although the third doubles team of senior Paul Adkins and Mike
Driscoll ’84 notched the only win of the day for the Bisons, the
match was by no means as lopsided as the score indicated.

According to Reynolds, ‘Several players were either up in the
first set or took the set, only to lose the match in the second or third.
We could have pulled it out if we had held the upper hand. I really
thought we could have won four of the six singles matches.”

Adkins echoed the teams’ disappointment with its play, but
added ‘our competition outside the conference is tough, and it
helps us gain experience, but it doesn’t lend itself to a tremendous
dual meet record.”

Indeed, the Bisons’ schedule includes several very fine teams, in-
cluding Rutgers, Penn State, Army, and Rochester. ‘Our goal,”
explained Adkins, “is to do well in the ECC tournament in three
weeks.”

In the meantime, the netters must face the immediate likes of
East Stroudsburg at the Bucknell courts tomorrow—if the weather
holds up.

ckinson and Gettysburg in 2-3 week

By ARTHUR BROCKWAY
There is still a chill to the
Spring air, but as the season pro-
gresses, the Bison bats have been
warming up.
Bucknell’s record now stands
at 5-9 after a 2-3 week that pro-

vided just a little bit more con-
fidence for the young baseball
team.

Wednesday’s matchup witn
Mansfield proved a defensive
battle for eight innings before
three unearned runs crossed the

plate in the top of the ninth, a cou-
ple of misplayed bunts turned the
game into a heartbreaker for pit-
cher Ken Durr ’82.

Durr, who pitched himself out
of some tight situations all after-
noon, did not allow an earned run.

Catcher Scott Dow ‘81 takes a rip in the Bisons’ 4-1 loss to Mansfield Wednesday. Dow, who has
surpassed the University career doubles record, has been the squad’s leading hitter this

spring.

The Mansfield surge broke a 1-1
deadlock which lasted seven in-
nings, and upped the winner’s
record to 9-5.

Monday’s visit with Dickinson
was a boost to morale after a
Saturday clobbering by West
Chester. Dickinson began the
scoring with a run in the second,
but should have prayed for rain
after that. The Bisons charged
back in the bottom of the second
when a Glenn Mattheis ’83 triple
brought home Jim Frantz ’83 and
Car] Nablo ’82.

With two out in the third, Scott
Dow ’81 singled home one run,
and after a double steal, senior
Captain Bill Lawrence singled
home two more.

Two runs were added in the
sixth on a double by Paul Bam-
ford ’83, and the batsmen capped
their scoring in the eighth with
singles by Bamford and junior
Mike Palumbo and another Mat-
theis triple. Tom Ganter ’81
raised his record to 3-1 while
Durr contributed two scoreless
innings to end the day.

While the Bisons were

creamed, 24-3, in the first game
of Saturday’s twinbill at West
Chester, the second game found
Bucknell in the ballpark, as the
squad fell 3-2. Sophomore Ed
Hughes pitched an excellent
game, which he might have won
had the game not been called in
the top of the eighth because of
darkness.

Bamford began and ended the
Bucknell attack with a two-run
homer in the first inning, but the
Golden Rams upped their record
to 14-3 with the sweep.

Friday’s defeat of Gettysburg
was a see-saw battle until
Bucknell shot the Bullets’ hopes
in the eighth. Dow initiated things
with a triple, and after two walks
and a fielder’s choice produced
one run, junior George Kangos
singled. An error was committed,
as two more crossed the plate and
the batsmen sent Gettysburg to
the showers with a 7-4 victory.

The Bisons travel to Trenton,
N.J. tomorrow to face the Rider
Broncs in a doubleheader—the
batsmen will have played six
games in seven days.

Psychology professor ts

hired amid controversy

By LISA CERUTI and M.E. WEIL

In a move reminiscent of the Stuart Rothenberg case a year ago, a
visiting professor of psychology here has been passed over in her bid
for a tenure-track job in favor of another candidate who was originally
not one of the department’s final four choices.

Although Nancy Cain enjoyed a substantial amount of student sup-
port and was originally fourth on her department’s list of top
preferences for the position, the job was offered to another woman not
on that list after the top choice for the psychology slot declined the
University’s offer.

The members of the Department of Psychology voted unanimously
during Spring Break to offer the job instead to Nancy Caine — a
primatologist with an eerily coincidental name now doing post doc-
torate research at the University of Colorado Medical Center — ac-
cording to Psychology Department Chairman Ernest Keen.

Keen said Cain and Caine both applied for the nationally - advertised
position along with more than 100 other applicants.

The job had first been offered to Judith Gibbons — a population con-
trol researcher at the University of St. Louis — but she turned tne offer
down March 25 to the ‘‘surprise’’ of Keen. Cain and the two other can-
didates on the “short list,” Mary Cheal and Jane Veaith, were all then
reconsidered, but the department could not reach a decision for
reasons Keen said were “somewhat personal.”

The psychologists then decided March 28 that they wanted “to see
one more candidate” and Nancy Caine — who the chairman said
“might have been tied in rank with Nancy Cain” — was invited to
make a presentation here.

Keen said the reason the decision was “rushed” and happened over
Spring Break was that with “an attractive job like this, there is a
premium to hiring when the applicant pool is at its peak. We were wor-
ried that if we waited until after vacation, the most desirable ap-
plicants would be gone.”

Although the students who had reviewed the other applicants were
not available to evaluate Caine since her presentation was during
Spring Break, Professor of Psychology Douglas Candland contacted

Amendments passed by
record turnout of voters

The right to veto

Appropriations Okd ;

By SUSAN MACDONALD

Amendments to the ABS Con-
stitution designed to strengthen
the representative power of the
congress and give the group a
more diversified membership
were overwhelmingly approved
in a school - wide referendum
Wednesday.

The first amendment on the
ballot, which received 89 percent
of the votes cast, empowers the
congress to override ‘any deci-
sion of the ABS Appropriations
Committee” by a two-thirds vote
of the congress’ total member-
ship.

ABS Treasurer and amend-
ment author Andy Brody ’82 said
the amendment was written to
enable the congress — and
thereby all students indirectly —
to have final jurisdiction over the
use of funds generated by the Stu-

New polling place

& date boosts voting

Aided by an additional polling
place and an altered voting date,
more than one-third of University
undergraduates cast ballots
Wednesday for ABS members - at
- large, class officers and two
ABS constitutional amendments,
the largest voter turnout since
1979.

By placing a ballot box in the
entrance lobby of the Ellen Clark
Bertrand Library and moving the
election from a Tuesday to a
Wednesday, ABS Steering Com-
mittee members had hoped to in-
crease voter participation by giv-
ing them an additional place to
vote on the day of the week in
which: the most classes are
scheduled, according to ABS Vice
President Missy Campbell ’82.

After the end of the voting,
Campbell said the addition of a
polling place at the academic
center of the campus had at-
tracted new voters who otherwise
would have remained at class or
in fraternity houses clustered
nearby. But the traditional voting

Dance program is
under scrutiny of

Curriculum group

By LYNNE RUTHERFORD

A University committee has circulated a
questionnaire to present any former
students of dance here to determine the ex-
tent of student interest and participation in
the dance program and to evaluate the
program’s academic merit.

“There appears to be some question
among certain members of the faculty
about whether the program is sufficiently
academic,” according to Professor of
Biology Hulda Magelhaes, who is chairing
the subcommittee of the Curriculum Com-
mittee of the College of Arts and Sciences
that is making the evaluation.

“In part, this stems from the fact that
dance has no real home in any department
here,” Magelhaes said.

She added that work has just been
started by the subcommittee and the stu-
dent questionnaires have yet to be review-
ed. “When we analyze the questionnaires,
we will be able to comment further on the
program,” she said.

“T don’t know what the subcommittee’s
charge is or what the nature of their
recommendations will be,” said professor
of Political Science Gene Chenoweth, a
member of the University’s Dance Pro-
gram Committee, which serves as a lia-
sion between the University administra-
tion and Joan Moyer Clark, Bucknell’s sole
instructor of Dance. The group also helps
in the organization and administration of
Clark’s classes.

Faculty debates writing proposal; English dept.

By LISA CERUTI

The University faculty opened debate on
the controversial proposal for a University
writing program Monday, hotly debating the
spirit and substance of the plan but failing to
begin to vote on any of its dozen parts.

After University Committee on Instruction
Chairman Joseph LaBarge presented the first
motion of the 12-part plan for school-wide
writing education before the 90 members
gathered for the special faculty meeting, 16
professors rose to comment on the program,
with those speaking evenly split in their opi-
nion about the plan’s merit.

Of the nine members of the English depart-
ment who made speeches on the motion —
which presumably would have profound ef-
fects on the tenor and structure of the depart-
ment if effected — five were in favor and four
opposed.

But although LaBarge asserted in his open-
ing remarks that ‘major changes recom-
mended by departments” in a formal solicita-
tion had been included in a revised document,

Baumwoll said ‘‘the issues addressed in the
revisions did not strike at the essential con-
cerns some of us had.””

Baumwoll said he and other members of the
department are “left with a lack of clear
definition” of the three stages of writing
courses that would constitute the hub of the
proposed program. “‘The feasibility of the
program is questionable, particularly the
vagueness of the kind of faculty participation
that will be necessary,” he said.

On the other hand, Associate Professor of
English Philip Withim, a member of the In-
struction Committee, told the faculty
Bucknell still ‘‘owes its students a coherent
program to teach students how to write effec-
tive prose.”

Professor of History and English Michael
Payne opposed the proposal, saying the first
and second-level courses described are
similar to courses currently offered. Payne
compared the W1 courses to 100-level English
courses and said the W2 curriculum ‘“‘looks
familiar.” Courses which require term

description of W2 courses—are “not
necessarily courses in writing and I wouldn’t
want to pass them off as such,” Payne said.

Professor of English John Wheatcroft said
the proposal ‘‘is a wasteful, inefficient way to
proceed.”’ According to Wheatcroft, it is not
very wise to institute ‘‘requirements for
graduation implemented by a staff (the pro-
posed Composition Council that would
oversee the program) that will be voluntary
and does not yet even exist.”

Other departments whose members voiced
opinions included economics, civil engineer-
ing, political science and classics. Associate
Professor of Economics Peter Kresl said it
would be difficult for the economics depart-
ment to staff W3 courses. ‘In departments
with large numbers of majors, it will be dif-
ficult to come up with seven sections of 25
students and work within the system,” Kresl
said.

LaBarge said Wednesday ‘‘the debate at
the meeting Monday was precisely what I had
expected.”’ The public debate is scheduled to

Group plans campaign to
coincide with Klan visit

By JEFF CROSS

A group of students, faculty members and Lewisburg residents, con-
cerned about the Ku Klux Klan’s planned appearance here May 9, for-
mulated tentative plans this week for a literature campaign and a
public march to coincide with the visit.

The group, United Against The Klan, plans to print and distribute
5,000 pamphlets containing the history of the Klan, morals-raising
questions and sources of anti-Klan information, group member Britt
Clayton ’81 said.

Plans call for a non-violent rally in Lewisburg with speakers, poetry
readings and singing— whether or not the members of the Klan ap-
pear to solicit new members the second Saturday in May— according
to Clayton.

A discussion of ‘“‘the nature of a non-violent demonstration” was led
by Assistant Professor of Economics Charles Sackrey at noon today.
Those at the workshop ‘‘discussed the importance of non-violence at a
public rally to ensure a peaceful gathering,” Sackrey said. The
publicity campaign, to be funded by contributions from students and
Lewisburg residents, is also in the offing.

Official plans will be resolved by the group at 8 p.m. Monday at the
First Baptist Church of Lewisburg. Having a set agenda will help us
stay together and prevent confrontations with the Klan,” Rick Laboda
84, said.

United Against The Klan drew 38 campus and Lewisburg residents
to an organizational meeting Monday at the First Baptist Church, and
more than 200 students and faculty attended an April 10 meeting in
Walls Lounge of the University Center concerning the then-scheduled
April 11 appearance of the Klan for a membership drive.

Klan officials cancelled the appearance that day, however, when
they were told it would coincide with the Black Arts Festival .

Unanimous committee vote amends
University policy on use of firearms

By CINDY WARMAN

In a reversal of official school policy, the Univer-
sity Committee on Complementary Activities voted
unanimously Wednesday to prohibit the possession
or use by students of any firearms on campus.

The new rule—which is expected to be routinely
approved by the office of the president—would pro-
hibit firearms ‘‘including but not limited to rifles,
handguns, guns, bows and arrow, slingshots or ex-
plosives, including fireworks and dynamite.

The former policy allowed for both possession and
use of firearms if they were properly registered by
Campus Security and stored by the Department of
Military Science.

The proposal to change the policy came from
Associate Director of Residential Life Gerald Com-
merford, who said the old policy was inadequate
since it assumed that the now-defunct rifle range
under the stands of Memorial Stadium would be
available for the storage of firearms. Since the
range is closed, there is no facility on campus for
the safe storage and use of weapons, Commerford
said.

According to Commerford, without the use of the
range for storage, he has stored students’ ammuni-

tion in his office during this year.

Although he has. searched for an alternative
storage area, Commerford said Campus Security
has insufficient space for such a responsibility and
the Military Science department does not want to
get involved with student weapons.

Commerford said rarely have more than 10
students registered weapons so there has never
been much of a problem. Under the new policy, if
students are found in violation, they will be dealt
with in accordance with University disciplinary
procedures listed in the Student Handbook.

Any deviation from the rules will be reported,
Commerford said, since more than two-thirds of
students live in supervised residence halls.

Activities such as the fencing club would not be af-
fected by the policy since their events are super-
vised and the swords are properly stored. If a suffi-
cient location for the storage and use of firearms is
found, the use of weapons for that purpose will once
again be allowed.

Committee Chairman Bill Thum ’82 said ‘‘the new
policy allows flexibility in prohibiting firearms on
campus unless sufficient supervision and secure
storage is available.”

Thirty juniors were inducted into the University’s
chapter of Mortar Board, the national scholarship,
leadership and service honorary society in Hunt
Hall Tuesday.

More than 300 students were originally eligible for
membership based on the 3.0 grade point average
requirement for students in their junior year. An ap-
plication was mailed to these candidates requiring
completion of an activities and interest sheet along
with a faculty recommendation.

Chapter President Glenn Tullman ’81 said all
students fulfilling the grade point requirement were
considered and that completion of the application
only serves to supplement previous knowledge of
the prospective members. This year, two of the in-
ductees were chosen without a completed applica-
tion, Tullman said.

“Although scholarship, leadership and service
are requirements for membership, service is the
primary quality that is stressed in the selection pro-

Mortar Board activities include sponsorship of
the Last Lecture Series in which a professor is
asked to speak as if it will be the last lecture he will
give, Tullman said. This semester, Professor of
English John Wheatcroft will lecture on the topic of
“Good-bye to Good-bye Mr. Chips” at 7:30 p.m. May

Caine hired to fill psychology position

From CAINE, page 1.

| ar from April 14-17, was intended to raise money for the

two students who were on cam-
pus and asked that they listen to
the colloquium. Keen said this
was “‘irregular’’ but ‘those were
the only students we could find.”

According to Keen, Cain was
the best qualified in the students’
opinions but ‘‘colleaguiality,
research and teaching ability”
are also important and ‘‘students
do not have all the data that we
have. Student opinion was not ig-
nored.”’

But, “My main concern has
been with my students,” Cain
said. ‘‘The students felt their opi-
nions were not seriously con-

sidered. What has helped me in
the classroom has probably hurt
me professionally. I’m an
outspoken person and have a
strong personality.”’

Cindy Jessen ’81, who was one
of the students who reviewed the
original three applicants, said
she ‘‘doesn’t think student input
had any effect on the decision.”

Students who volunteered to
participate in the review process
heard the colloquiums presented
by Cheal, Veaith and Gibbons.
There were “between four and
six students” at each presenta-
tion who submitted anonymous
written evaluations of the can-
didates, Keen said.

In addition, students submitted
an “estimated 12 papers signed
by two to three people each”
which recommended Cain and
were placed in her file, Keen
said.

Keen said the four candidates
were “rated on the basis of
students’ evaluations and our
own.”

The opening in the department
became available last summer
when Professor of Psychology
Alan Leshner, who was on a leave
of absence since September 1979,

Veto given to ABS Congress;
BSA gets guaranteed member

From VETO, page 1.

on the general election ballot only
after special vote - by - proxy ar-
rangements were approved by
the house.

The ABS Constitution requires
two-thirds of the voting member-
ship to approve of any proposed
amendment while attending a
regular congress meeting before
the proposal can be passed on to
the student body for a referen-
dum. But a quorum and sufficient
support for the two amendments
were lacking at the congress
meeting April 13, prompting ABS
President Michael Suarez ’82 to
ask congressional permission for
the Steering Committee to con-
duct telephone balloting of those
members officially excused from
the meeting.

The Castle amendment, which
had 18 ‘“‘yes’’ votes in congres-
sional session, and the Brody
amendment, which had 22, were
then given the required support
by those casting ballots by proxy.
Twenty-eight votes were re-
quired for approval of each.

Suarez said the benefit of using
the ‘‘in absentia’’ votes outweigh-
ed the problems of members
voting without first hearing
debate during a meeting. In each
case there was a time constraint
that forced action to be taken to
enable the questions to appear on
Wednesday’s ballots, Suarez
said.

A second amendment

presented by Brody calling for an
annual schoolwide vote on the Ap-
propriations Committee’s budget
was defeated, also after “in
absentia” voting. The proposal
would have allowed a majority
vote by the student body to veto
the proposed budget.

“The money belongs te the
students, not the Appropriations
Committee, and the students
should have a say in how it is us-
ed,” Brody said.

Arguments against the pro-
posal centered on suggested
bureaucratic difficulties and the
current existence of a method to
appeal decisions.

Suarez said a referendum could
be dominated by a relatively
small group of people. He said ap-
propriations involve complex
procedures, and there could be
difficulty in both getting an in-
formed public and enough
students out to vote.

ABS Vice President Missy
Campbell ’82 said the alternative
of an open forum where questions
concerning the budget could be
raised by students would be more
feasible than a public referen-
dum. Suarez and Brody said such
an open forum on the budget was
very possible.

“In a student government so
concerned with apathy, this is an
unfortunate turn of events for a
participatory democracy,”
Brody said after defeat of his pro-
posal.

High voter turn-out sets record

From HIGH, page 1.

University Center had also been
heavily trafficked, she said, and
a total of 1050 students went to the
polls.

In the campus-wide election for
ABS Congress members - at -
large, junior Todd Buchholz was
reelected with 705 votes, the
highest total of the 12 candidates
in the running for the eight slots.
Rashid Ashraf ’82 was also
reelected for a third term as an
at-large member with the third
highest vote total, while Bill
Thum ’82 finished second with 675
votes. Also elected were
sophomores Susan MacDonald
and David Tyler and freshmen
David Grossman, Christina
Kounelias and Dan Huck.

These congress members —
who comprise the bulk of the
powerful ABS Appropriations
Committee — will take office in
September.

The most hotly contested class -
officer election was for president
of the Class of ’84, with freshman
Bob Fessler defeating Steve Gar-
finkel by eleven votes out of 332
cast. Scooter Hoerner won reelec-
tion as vice president of the class
unopposed, while Susan Stanley

won 60 percent of the vote in
defeating Helayne Sherman for
secretary - treasurer.

More than 43 percent turned
out to vote for senior class of-
ficers, with Class Vice President
David Flinchbaugh defeating
both Mike Palumbo and David
Hawkings for the presidency with
49 percent. Luanne Savino beat
write-in candidate Patricia Out-
man with 67 percent, while Nancy
Weaver was chosen unopposed
for the secretary - treasurer’s
post.

In the only contested race for
an officer for the Class of ’83,
George Tsougarakis took the
presidency over Barbara Fedele
and Lon Castle with 48 percent of
the votes cast. Forty-one percent
of the sophomores also elected
Anne Maher as vice president
and Gail Post as_ secretary-
treasurer in uncontested races.

The lowest turnout was
mustered by the current senior
class, with less than 5 percent
voting for four people unopposed
in their quest for offices of the
alumni class. Ray Monasterski,
Eric Hoerner, Carol Christie and
Bath Battin were all given the
nod to lead the class’s alumni ac-
tivities.

Women’s Issues Group will present

a teach-in on sex,

By NANCY KERVIN
In an effort to make men and women aware of
sexism, the Women’s Issues Group of the Bucknell
Progressive Caucus is sponsoring a teach-in, April
27-30, entitled ‘‘Sex, Politics, and Fun: The Roles
of Women in the 80s.

The teach-in is scheduled to begin with noted
feminist author Pauline Bart, a professor of
Sociology at the University of Illinois, who will
speak on ‘‘Rape and Sexism”’ at 7:30 p.m. Monday
in Olin Science Auditoriom. A panel discussion
will follow moderated by teach-in co-coordinator
Laura Kinney ’81 and including Bart, assistant
Professor of Sociology Kim Scheppele, Lynne An-
dreades ’81 and Vernitia Shannon ’81.

A professional improvisational theatre troupe
from New York will present the political satire
Wax Dux, which delves into many feminist issues,
7p.m. Tuesday evening in Coleman Hall.

The teach-in will end at 7:30 Thursday with a
presentation on sexual harassment in the home,
school and workplace in Olin Science Auditorium.
Helen Koschoff, assistant attorney general in the
Pennsylvania Commission for Women, and Presi-
dent of Human Services Management Associates
Faith Howarth will lead the discussion.

politics and fun

Andreades, also a co-coordinator of the teach-in,
said the purpose is to discuss the attitudes of sex-
ism on campus.

“These issues include the offensive way women
are portrayed on the T-shirts printed by Third
Kress this year, the sexist way women are por-
trayed on fraternity party ads and the insensitive
and offensive attitudes towards women in ‘The
Bucknell Dilemma,’ ~a weekly cartoon strip
feature of the Bucknellian, Andreades said.

Third Kress resident John Held 784 said
““Women have an archtypical inferiority complex
that is inevitably brought out by things such as the
T-shirt—this feeling is not something we are
responsible for.”

“It’s a shame people who are so fanatical about
certain issues often let obsessions interfere with a
sense of humor. The ‘‘Dilemma’”’ is not meant to
offend anyone,” ‘Bucknell Dilemma” author
Steve Diorio ’82 said.

The Women’s Issues Group was started
specifically to organize the teach-in, but members
are planning to reactivate some of the programs
of the now-defunct Women’s Concern Group, an
organization, which suffered from student apathy
and ceased to exist last semester, teach-in co-
coordinator Nina Kaminsky ’81 said. es

— A guided tour through the places immortalized in his previous best

ing dales, the snowy hills, the farms, the becks, the towns where all of
Herriot’s memorable characters have worked, played, and lived their
lives of joy and sadness and rich fulfillment.

The most beloved storyteller of our time returns at last with the most happily anticipated title of the oa
decade, the line that completes the verse: The 3

All Creatures Great and Small, Madel hem All

James Herriot is back, with his warm and lovely wife Helen, the bumptious Tristan, the fractious
Siegfried, and all the colorful,tovable characters—human and animal—of the Yorkshire we have come to
know so well. James and Helen now have two children, the war is over, and life on the glorious dales is
back to normal—except for the hilarious expedition that takes James behind the Iron Curtain to look at
veterinarians on a real live Animal Farm that even Orwell could not have imagined!

WORLD

U.S. opens an arms
P'
pact with Saudis

The Reagan Adminstration an-
nounced Tuesday a proposed sale
to Saudi Arabia of a multibillion-
dollar arms package, including
five Awacs electronic surveil-
lance planes, and the Israeli
government responded to the
plan with “profound regret’ the
next day.

The Administration, however,
said it remained ‘‘firmly commit-
ted’’ to Israel’s security and con-
tended the proposed sale would
not endanger the Israelis.

Any sale of U.S. military equip-
ment requires Congressional ap-
proval here.

In addition to the official Israeli
government response, Abba
Eban said his Labor Party would
fight the American sale of
weapons to Saudi Arabia if it was
returned to power in the June 30
general election.

Haig is opposed to

rights violations

Secretary of State Alexander
Haig said the United States
should oppose human rights
violations ‘“‘by ally or adversary”
with the provision that
totalitarian regimes be more
critically viewed than
authoritarian ones.

Haig described totalitarian
regimes as dominating all
aspects of their citizens’ lives and
resisting change. Authoritarian
regimes, he said, dominate only
some areas of their citizens’ lives
and are more open to change.

Although not mentioning any
specific countries, Haig said due
to “intolerance,” there had been
a huge number of refugees
recently from the Soviet Union,
Cuba, Vietnam, Cambodia and
Afghanistan. .

Aides said Haig’s statements
were not the Administration’s
final position. The remarks were
part of a speech presented at the
March 31 meeting of the
Trilateral Commission, a policy
discussion group of businessmen
and intellectuals, from Western
Europe, North America and
Japan.

NATIONAL

1200 lobby against
cuts in student aid

Students from across the nation
participated in National Student
Action Day Thursday in an effort
to encourage students to write
letters, sign petitions and make
phone calls “in support of higher
education.”

National response to National
Student Action Day was intended
to inform President Reagan and
Congress of the impact of pro-
posed cuts in student aid.

The United States Student
Association, The American
Association of State Colleges and

Universities and numerous other
collegiate organizations and in-
stitutions supported the National
Student Action Day.

More than 1200 students lobbied
in Washington April 13 in opposi-
tion to the proposed cuts in stu-
dent financial aid programs
which would exclude 500,000
students from post-secondary
education. Three members of the
ABS were among those who at-
tended.

GNP increases 6.5
percent annually

A 6.5 percent annual increase
in the nation’s gross national pro-
duct was reported for the first
quarter of 1981 Monday —the big-
gest quarterly gain since the se-
cond quarter of 1978.

The Commerce Department’s
report also showed inflation eas-
ing in two indexes connected with
the G.N.P. measurements, which
many economists consider
broader measures of rising costs
than the Consumer Price Index.

Reagan Administration of-
ficials disclaimed the quarter’s
G.N.P. and price improvements
and dwelled on recent signs of
weakness in the economy, asser-
ting the undiminished need for
Congress to pass the economic
program intact despite the
report.

Engineers top Arts
in 81 job market

The nation’s Class of ’81 college
graduates will enter a job market
that is both better and worse than
it was for the Class of ’80, for
while engineers are being wooed
with starting salaries of close to
$30,000, liberal arts graduates are
scrounging to find jobs that pay
less than half that figure.

According to career placement
officers and a survey of 161 col-
leges and universities by the New
York Times, the market looks
much the way it did last year, but
both its strengths and weak-
nesses have been accentuated.

LOCAL

Local kidneys aid

Czech and German

A kidney transplant fron a 23-
year-old Lewisburg man killed in
an auto accident late last week
has offered new hope for two
seriously ill patients behind the
Iron Curtain.

When local artist and musician
James McCarthy died Friday,
doctors at the Geisinger Medical
Center in Danville set in motion a
world-wide network to find reci-
pients for McCarthy’s undam-
aged kidneys. By noon Saturday,
the kidneys had been removed,
packed in ice and sent to patients
in East Berlin and Prague,
Czechoslovakia, according to a
copyright story in the Press-
Enterprise Newspapers of
Bloomsburg.

“My husband is the type of per-
son who is always willing to give
more than he really had,” said
McCarthy’s wife, Leota. ~

Economic strategy
planned for Rt. 15

An updated report on a study to
develop an economic develop-
ment strategy for the area on
either side of Route 15 was
presented Wednesday night at a
SEDA-COG board meeting.

A draft report of the study’s fin-
dings will be ready by June 1, and
is scheduled to identify those
areas along the highway where
there is the best potential for
growth in manufacturing,
agriculture and commerical
enterprises .

Delegates to UN
evacuated by blaze

A 17-member delegation of
Bucknell students won an
honorable mention for their
representation of Japan at a
model United Nations last
weekend, but only after they and
approximately 1,200 other stu-
dent delegates were evacuated
from their hotel during an early
morning fire Friday.

The five-alarm blaze in a third
floor ballroom at the New York
Statler Hotel in midtown Manhat-
tan began at 2:45 a.m., injuring
14 of the building’s residents. But
none of the University students—
who were housed on the fourth,
sixth and 16th floors that night—
were reported injured.

Guests were allowed to return
to their room at about 6 a.m., but
U. N. student representatives
were moved to the Hilton Hotel
later in the day.

The Bucknell group was one of
21 to be honored from the 120
universities and colleges that
sent delegates to the the five-day
conference sponsored by the Na-
tional Collegiate Association,
Inc., which concluded Sunday
morning with a ceremony in the
U.N. General Assembly.

Surprising impressions

There were a number of things about Wednesday’s general elec-
tion that both suprised and impressed us.

Perhaps the most surprising thing was the pure logistics of the
election day. So sure were we that it would be held on a Tuesday that
we said so last week without checking with officials first, and so sure
were we that our only opportunity to vote would be after lunch that
we voted in the UC lobby on the way to the library. Both surprises
paid off, thankfully, as the most impressive figures of the day
became the number of ballots cast for the officers and amendments.
The 1050 votes are something a small town might envy; the im-
pressive end here more than justified the surprising means.

Also impressive was the so-called Brody amendment, a well-
intentioned and appropriate gesture from the man charged with
organizing the appropriating. Andy’s surprise attempt to make the
ABS more active in the distribution of student funds could only have
been topped in its altruistic ideal by an amendment calling the entire
study body into the decision-making process — an idea Brody tried
on but failed with his congressional colleagues.

But that part of the story, unfortunately, came as no surprise.

Off target

It is an interesting coincidence that the University’s policy on
the possession and use of firearms on campus be revised so closely
on the heels of the near national tragedy involving a handgun.

While we applaud the committee’s decision to prohibit all
weapons from campus in spirit, we wonder if the new policy could
have unexpected — and unwanted — results. The old policy provided
at least a modicum of order and information regarding the
whereabouts and use of weapons. While all were surely not
registered and stored, there were provisions for this to occur which
assuredly limited their use and availability.

The new policy, although restricting weapons, provides no
assurance this will occur. The haven of residence halls and fraterni-
ty houses could provide the necessary temptation to resist the rules
just as nightly beer blasts ignore State law.

Perhaps it would have been better for the administration to
establish an alternative to Gerry Commerford’s office or the rifle
range for the storage and use of weapons rather than deny — and
thus ignore — their presence altogether.

The near-successful attempt on Ronald Reagan’s life a month
ago reminds us that our country — and our campus — need to
reevaluate positions on the possession and use of weapons. Perhaps
increased regulation rather than strict prohibition is the more ra-
tional answer.

Reviews

The current review of the dance program underway by a sub-
committee of the College of Arts and Sciences Curriculum Commit-
tee could be the worst thing ever to happen to the just blossoming
artform here. Or it could be the best.

Many of Bucknell’s leotard-clad students fear that the group
conducting the study is on some sort of artistic witch hunt in which
the concept of dance - for - credit is to be exposed as an idea con-
tradictory to the University’s notion of academic rigor. And they
fear the opportunity to be rewarded academically for discovering an
aesthetic and creative experience may soon be stifled by a group
that thinks dancing is a form of phys. ed., not a form of art. ;

We think, and we certainly hope, that their fears are unwar-
ranted. Our investigation into the dance curriculum investigation
shows those involved in the program — from the ‘students to the
Dance Program Committee to the Curriculum Committee (and of
course Joan Clark) — to be enthusiastic about dance at Bucknell for
a variety of reasons. So are we, and we encourage those now looking
at the dancers to give them the moral and academic boost they
deserve.

The United States will spring forward into Daylight Sav-
ings Time this weekend, with residents of Lewisburg and
every other town in the United States setting their clocks
ahead one hour. Eastern Standard officially jumps into
Daylight Savings when 2 a.m. becomes 3 a.m. Sunday
morning — so be prepared to lose an hour’s sleep.

and the Bucknellian helped out by
giving it front-page headlines,
while the Black Arts Festival was
tucked away in obscurity on page
13. Given the publicity the Klan
received—not only from the
Bucknellian but also from signs
plastered all over the campus—a
prospective black student might
have thought he had come to the
wrong “festival” 100 years ago.

The Klan was also able to
spread some propaganda that I
won’t repeat here, with one ex-
ception. Their representative
said they had decided, out of the
goodness of their hearts(?), to
allow the ‘special program for
black students to occur without
incident.” But the subtle racism
was apparent — it was not a
special program or even separate
put equal, but rather a festival
for the University community
which many students enjoyed.

I do not want to be understood
as saying that the Klan episode
should not have been reported. In
ademocracy all people share cer-
tain rights, including free speech.
But it was playing right into their
hands to give them front-page
billing. I thought it would have
been more appropriate to place
them on page 13. No one has a
monopoly on truth—all news
should be reported and different
views expressed. However, the
Bucknellian does have a monopo-
ly of sorts on the press. With this
monopoly comes a responsibility.
News reporting is important, but
so is discretion. Let’s hope that
the Bucknellian can i
balance.

What’s antithetical, unjust and legal? Apartheid is

By Phil Andrews

ae eee

Tragedy on a mass scale is a characteristic of
our time. In Kampuchea, genocide and starva-
tion eliminated two to three million people be-
tween 1975 and 1979. And now in East Africa,
more than a million will starve unless emergen-
cy food relief reaches them.

Yet the human carnage in Kampuchea and
East Africa differs significantly from the human
tragedy and suffering in the Republic of South
Africa. For in the land of Alan Paton’s Cry, the
Beloved Country, tragedy is institutionalized
through apartheid. It is “‘legal.”’

But “legal” only it is not. It is accelerating as

well. The South African government is carrying
LL

PHILLING
IN

apartheid to its logical conclusion — the ter-
ritorial separation of blacks from non-blacks.

They are accomplishing this by creating a “na-
tional state” for each of the 10 major South
African tribes. Four have been established thus
far: Transkei (1976), Bophuthatswana (1977),
Venda (1979) and Ciskei (1980).

The South African government claims that
these ‘‘states’’ conduct their own foreign policy.
In fact, however, they are recognized by no state
save South Africa. With economic dependency on
their creator common to all, these “homelands”
are more akin to reservations than to states.

The homelands strategy has been accompanied
by a much-heralded series of “petty apartheid”
reforms (e.g., integration of sports, limited
black trade union rights, et al.). Together they
constitute a velvet-glove, iron-fist government
attempt to consolidate white minority domina-

tion (18 percent) of the black majority (71 per-
cent).

Amid the turmoil of events in Iran, Poland and
Central America, though, United States policy
toward South Africa has received less attention
than it merits.

This is unwise. Apartheid is a morally repug-
nant law that for many black Africans and black
Americans recalls painful memories of exploita-
tion by whites. For example, Nigeria — which
supplies 16 percent of the U.S.’s imported oil —
uses its exports to influence recipient states’ sup-
port for majority rule in Namibia and for the
abolishment of apartheid. Unfortunately, US.
rhetorical condemnation is more than offset by
U.S. strengthening of the white-run South
African economy.

Furthermore, South Africa’s location is excep-
tionally strategic. Eighty percent of Middle
Eastern oil is shipped around the Cape of Good
Hope. By tacitly bolstering the white
supremacist government, the U.S. risks even-
tually “losing” South Africa. Or, the Soviet
Union may gain influence with the black majori-
ty, and successfully portray the U.S. as an
enemy of the oppressed.

For these reasons, the U.S. should try to hasten
the day of black majority rule, with white
minority protection. A combination of skillful
U.S. diplomacy, coordinated U.S. and United Na-
tions economic sanctions and enlightened South
African self-interest are necessary to realize a
peaceful transition of power. As South Africa’s
major trading partner, and as the leader of the
international economy, the U.S. in conjunction
with other U.N. members can severely impair
the South African economy.

Apartheid is codified injustice, antithetical to
US. and U.N. ideals. Woodrow Wilson once aptly
prophesied, ‘Unless justice be done to others, it
will not be done to us.” U.S. policy toward South
Africa should reflect the wisdom of Wilson’s
words.

Friday, April 24, 1981

Dance instructor Joan Moyer Clark teaches dance 101 Tuesday night in the Field House Dance
Studio. The Dance program is currently under evaluation by a University Committee.

Dance program here currently
under review by Committee

“My committee exists because dance is not an
academic department. We do not do a very good job
and the committee is not convenient. A home for
dance in the academic department is necessary to
stop confusion with the program,” Chenoweth said.

“Bucknell should realize and fulfill the need for
an expanded program. Anyone who would suggest
that dance isn’t strenuous or doesn’t have academic
standards is ignorant of the program,” he said.

The dance program here currently consists of
three different courses which are offered each
semester, according to the University Class
Schedule for 1981-1982.

In judging the popularity of the program,
Chenoweth took into account both Clark’s over-
crowded classes — up to 80 students in Dance 101 —
and the capacity crowd that filled Coleman Hall for
the Dance Company’s presentation March 18.

Clark and the Dance Committee are preparing a
video tape of dance classes to be distributed to the
Curriculum Committee and its subcommittee. ‘“‘The
tape will show others what goes on down here,”
Clark said. ‘‘Students are so absorbed in the mental
aspect of things that they need time for the physical.

‘9 to 5’ is creative and amusing

My courses involve ballet, jazz and body condition-
ing, and give students an awareness of their bodies
that stays with them forever.”’

Several options exist for the future of the dance
curriculum here. One of them is to move the dance
curriculum — bolstered by additional instructors
and classes — into the theater division of the
English department. Another, more radical step,
would be to create a seperate department that
would encompass both theater and dance.

“Before either step is taken, however, separate
courses in other aspects of dance, such as history of
aesthetics, would have to be added to the program,”
Professor of English and Director of the University
Theatre Harvey Powers said.

But for now, Clark and the University are
satisfied with her position here. She has accepted
the school’s offer of another one-year contract to
teach and — though she would like some clerical
help and a budget she could help control — she said
“students here are the best I could ask for.”

“When I started four years ago I made do with
nothing, and interest in the program grew and
grew. We’re answering our purpose for now and lay-
ing the foundations for later,” she said.

Parton, Fonda and Tomlin provide light entertainment

» eS

and Dabney Cole-

Lily Tomlin
man in a scene from “Nine to
Five,” which opens tonight at
the Campus Theater.

By DAVID BLACKMAN

The light-hearted comedy
“Nine to Five,” starring Lily
Tomlin, Jane Fonda and Dolly
Parton, opens at the Campus
Theatre tonight, with show times
at 7 and 9p.m.

The movie fails as a thematic
film making a statement on male
chauvinism in the workplace. It
takes a serious situation that
deserves realistic consideration
and merely pokes fun at it.

As a creative and entertaining
work however, it most certainly
succeeds.

Set in a corporate office
building, the film revolves
around its three stars, all of
whom hold secretarial positions
in a giant conglomerate. They
are stereotypically discrim-
inated against by the boss and —
eventually — they decide to fight
back. Their decision is solidified
in a humorous scene in which the
three women smoke marijuana
and fantasize about killing the
boss.

In her film debut, Parton gives
an equitable performance as the
boss’ sexy but naive secretary.
Her comic timing is good, but her
lack of movie experience
becomes noticeable in moments
when she looks less than at ease
on screen.

Fonda does well with an often
simple script, but certainly her
role is in no way challenging to
her vast talent.

The best performance of the
three is given by Tomlin who,
through her mistaken belief that
she did in fact kill her boss, sets
the major comic action in motion
and keeps it rolling. The talented
supporting cast includes Dabney
Coleman and Elizabeth Wilson.

Some surprising turns in the
action — and the hit song by
Parton which brought the film an
Academy Award nomination —
combine with the aura of three
major stars to produce a very
amusing, though by no means
intellectual evening in front of the
Art-Deco silver screen.

Flying theme of yearly
Lewisburg Arts Festival

By ALLISON ABOUCHAR

More than 60 professional and amateur artists will participate in
the annual Indoor Art Show sponsored by the Lewisburg Council on
the Arts as part of the Spring Arts Festival.

The Indoor Art Show will officially open Thursday and run
through May 10 in the Beaver Memorial Methodist Church on South
Third Street.

The theme of this year’s festival is flying. Cash awards will be
presented in both professional and amateur arts and crafts
categories. A panel of professional artists from Lewisburg in-
cluding watercolorist Bradley Shoemaker, pen and ink artist
Janette Campbell, and Molly Ross — who is in charge of the
University Craft Shop — will judge the show.

Other activities planned for the celebration include a Fantastic
Flying Machine Contest, window displays, Outdoor Show and Sale,
poetry reading and Kite Contest.

The Fantastic Flying Machine Contest scheduled for May 2 will
promote the theme of the festival by encouraging people to design
and build contraptions that aviation pioneers might have imagined
as they developed the modern jet plane. The Council on the Arts
will present a $100 prize for the most fantastic invention.

Chairman of the Flying Machine Contest Ed Miller said he hopes
to involve Bucknell sororities and fraternities and he issued an in-
vitation to other area college groups to compete.

Registration for the Flying Machine Contest, which will be held at
Soldiers Memorial Park on North Water Street, has been extended
until Tuesday because of a lack of entrants, according to General
Chairman Marsha Scott Gori of Lewisburg.

“If there is no sizeable response at that time, the contest may
have to be cancelled,” she said.

Downtown merchants will turn over their store windows for the
artisans’ window displays which will go up Monday.

The Outdoor Show and Sale is also scheduled for Saturday from 9
a.m. to5 p.m. The area between Third and Fifth streets on Market
Street will be blocked off for the event.

Sponsored by the Lewisburg Chapter of the Pennsylvania Guild of
Craftsmen, the Outdoor Show will include a variety of arts and
crafts including pottery, stained glass, baskets and paintings — all
of which will be on sale.

“This year the outdoor part of the show is different because peo-
ple had to apply to get in,” Gori said. “‘Those accepted are usually
people who earn a sizeable amount of their income through art,”
she added.

Pigs will be roasted Friday evening at Soldiers Memorial Park,
where a French Cafe will be hosted Saturday. Packwood House
Museum, located at the park, will sponsor a display of artwork
from area high school students.

Music, theater and dance groups will perform on the festival
stage in the Northern Central Counties Bank parking lot all day
Saturday.

A poetry reading including Professor of English Kar] Patten,
Associate Professor of English Robert Taylor and Professor of
English John Wheatcroft will take place at the Valiant Trencher-
man Restaurant on Second Street at 8 p.m. May 4.

The Kite Contest, which will officially ‘‘fly the festival out,” ac-
cording to Gori, will take place May 10 at the Little League Field on
St. Anthony Street.

Softball falls
to Seton Hall

and Delaware

By S.J. FURMAN

Saturday’s games proved
disheartening on two courts for
Terrie Grieb’s Bucknell Women’s
softball team. First came a loss
to Seton Hall 5-1, and then
Delaware dropped the Bisons,
$1.

Both games were extremely
close, but according to Grieb, the
absence of power hitting and
precise fielding led to Bucknell’s
defeats.

Despite the unfavorable
results, Grieb said she was
‘pleased’? with both per-
formances. ‘“‘The errors were
there, but what really killed the
Bisons was a lack of hitting,” she
said.

In the first contest against Se-
ton Hall, Bucknell was held to a
mere two hits. Leading batter
Jackie Crump ’83 was held hitless
throughout both games. By the
7th inning the score was tied 1-1.
But the Pirates—currently 14-1-
1—scored four quick runs to pro-
vide the winning margin.

Cindy Connelly ’84 was praised
by Grieb for her outstanding per-
formance on the mound. Connelly
did an ‘“‘excellent job” for 17 in-
nings as she gave up a total of 15

The softball team dropped two games in their home tourney
Saturday. A chance to avenge the losses and improve its
record eluded Coach Terri Grieb's squad as Thursday's home
duel with Lafayette was washed out by rain.

hits and 8 runs.

The Bisons got a brief rest in
the tourney as Seton Hall
defeated Delaware 5-2. But the
Hens were determined not to
return home to Newark with an
0-2 slate for the day.

In the top of the 7th of that
game, Bucknell was in the lead

1-0 as Connelly had scattered just
two hits. With one out, Delaware
began to power the ball into the
outfield and after a series of
Bucknell errors, the score was
tied 1-1.

The deadlock stood until the top
of the 10th when Delaware scored
twice to notch a 3-1 victory.

By ROBERT BURNEY
Count the men’s track team
among the ever-growing clique of
Bucknell athletic teams whose
memories of New Brunswick,
N.J. this spring will be far from
memorable.

The thinclads were able to put
forth only a mediocre per-
formance at the Rutgers Relays
last Saturday, as they were
unable to place anyone in meet
events. One bright spot for the
Bisons during the unscored meet,
however, was sophomore Glenn
Gibney, whose time of 30:21.8 in
the 10,000 meter run qualified
him for the IC4A Championship.

The team fared only somewhat

better Saturday at the Penn State
Invitational, finishing fourth out

of five teams. Gary Bartlett ’82
turned in the team’s best in-
dividual performance by setting
a Bucknell record in the discus
event with a toss of 140 feet 4 in-
ches.

Other good performances in-
cluded junior Martin Carter’s
wind-aided 10.67 seconds in the
100 meters, Mike Ward ’82’s 49
feet 1% inches in the shot put, Ted
Lewis ’83’s triple jump of 46 feet
1% inches, and senior Al
Wegener’s javelin throw of 203
feet.

The host Nittany Lions won the
Invitational with a score of 131!2,
followed by Fairleigh Dickinson
(107), Slippery Rock (36%),
Bucknell (32) and Clarion State
(5).

Mudsharks easily win State title

From MUDSHARKS, page 16.

Seniors Peter Maier and Rick Barry played exceptionally well and
outstanding play by the whole team kept Bucknell unbeatable. Sun-
day’s 15-14 victory over Penn State secured the championship.

The frisbee players progress to the Eastern Regionals May 2, where
they will face stiff competition against top New Jersey teams. The
New Jersey Championship was won by a team composed of several
former Bucknell Ultimate standouts.

Tri-captain Linda Accettura ‘82 sprints ahead of Bloomsburg and Messiah runners during the
mile relay in Tuesday's tri-meet victory over the two teams on the University track.

Women’s track topples Messiah

and Bloomsburg in tri-meet

By JEANNE MINAHAN

By scoring victories over Bloomsburg, 77-66, and
Messiah, 77-16, on Bison turf Tuesday, the women’s
track team upped its record to 2-1. If the meet is a
forecast of future races, the Bisons have a promis-
ing season ahead as they took nine first places, five
seconds and eight thirds.

The victory was ‘‘a real accomplishment,” ac-
cording to tri-captain Linda Accettura ’82. ‘‘We lost
to Bloomsburg last year so everyone was psyched to
win.”

Sophomores Lonnie Fertik and Beth Bittel were
both double winners for Bucknell. Fertik captured
the 100-meter hurdles in 15.0 seconds and the high
jump with a leap of 5-1.125 feet. Bittel placed first in
the discus (113-8) and shot put (37-8.5) and also set a
new school record in the javelin with a toss of 104-6,
although she did not place in that event.

The Bisons dominated the sprints as Nancy Russo

’84 won the 220-yard dash (61.2) and Accettura cap-
tured the 880-yard run (2:25.6).

Freshmen distance runners Karen Flanagan and
Stacey Nicholson won the mile and two-mile runs
with times of 5:20.1 and 11:48 respectively.

Julia Vaughters ’84 — who “‘has been making a
strong showing in the meets thus far,” according to
coach Diane Ware — was second at 100-meters in
13.1 seconds. Classmate Sue Ladany was second in
the 440-yard dash and third in both the 100-meter
hurdles and high jump.

Accettura, Bittel, Fertik, Hecker, Nicholoson,
Russo and Vaughters were joined by sophomores
Laurie VanWyck, Laura Gaydos and Katrina Bikis
in the Penn Relays Thursday.

The tracksters travel to Clarion Saturday for an
invitational meet where “‘there will be a wide varie-
ty of competition,’ according to Ware.

Baseball splits at Rider,
ups season mark to 8-10

The Bisons split their two games with East Coast Conference oppo-
nent Rider Saturday, losing 8-0 in the first game but winning 5-4 in the
second.

In the opener Rider’s All-ECC pitcher Dave Malloy held Bucknell to
only three hits and faced only one batter more than the minimum in
shutting out the Bisons on his home mound. Ed Hughes ’83 suffered the
loss, dropping his record to 1-2, while Jim Smith ’84 pitched 5% strong
innings of three-hit ball for the Herd.

The second game was a different story, however, as the batsmen
triumphed 5-4 in 11 innings. Rider broke on top, leading 4-1 after three
innings. Senior Captain Bill Lawrence ’81 scored Bucknell’s run in the
second inning after leading off with a single. The Bisons tallied twice
in the fourth, making the score 4/3. With Lawrence on after an error,
Glenn Matthais ’83 singled, Mike Palumbo ’82 followed with an infield
single to load the bases and George Kangos ’81 singled in two runs.

The score remained the same until the seventh as freshman Mark
Glatz — who replaced Tom Ganter ’81 after 24% innings — held the
Broncos in check. In the seventh, the Bisons tied the game at 4-4. Jim
Eick ’82 and Paul Bamford ’83 opened with singles and, after a double
play advanced Eick to third, a passed ball allowed him to score. Ken
Durr ’82 replaced Glatz with one out in the eighth after Glatz hurled
424 hitless innings, but the Broncs retaliated by bringing in Malloy
again.

Both pitchers shut down their opponents, with Malloy hurling his 10th
and 11th scoreless innings of the day before he was pulled for a pinch-
hitter in the bottom of the ninth.

In the top of the eleventh, the Bisons went on top for the first time all
day. After two quick outs, Eick singled and Bamford — the team RBI
leader — cracked a double to left-center, scoring Eick. Durr held the
Broncos to up his record to 2-4 and the team’s record to 8-10.

The Bisons traveled to Penn State yesterday for a double-header and
visit Lafayette tomorrow for another twinbill.

The Bucknell ultimate frisbee team won
the State Championship last weekend by
remaining undefeated against four other
area teams in a two-day tournament at
Penn State featuring the six best teams in
Pennsylvania.

Although Bucknell had not won the State
Championship in two years, last
weekend’s performance demonstrated
that the Mudsharks remain a regional
frisbee power.

Saturday’s games were played in harsh
windy conditions which disrupted most
teams’ offensive coordination and made
scoring difficult. But despite the restric-
tions imposed by the weather, Bucknell
maintained an effective offense and was
quite successful in its scoring attempts.

As the day progressed, it became clear

Friday, April 24, 1981

their games. As Stalio Boyd 81 said:
“Despite our dissheveled and unorganized
appearance, we fielded a first class
team.”

The first game was a close match, with
the wind hampering the play of both
teams. In the second half, however,
Bucknell effectively shut down the
Philadelphia Frisbee Club’s offense and
repeatedly turned interceptions and block-
ed passes into scores.

Although PFC was seeded first in the
tournament, Bucknell won 12-9. Bucks
County and Penn also suffered losses at
the hands of Bucknell Ultimate, 14-4 and
11-4 respectively.

Opening against Bucks, Bucknell scored
six unanswered goals before the opponent
called a timeout. Bucknell’s zone defense
was outstanding, with the losing team
barely mustering an offense.

The Mudsharks defeated three opponents in State College Saturday and Sun-

day to win the State Championship for the first time in three years. Mat Cie cipermeke would Ghratnate: iho!

Golfers take Ist, ond |
at Bucknell invitational

By JACK SNYDER

The surging golf team enjoyed a winning week highlighted by a
sweep of first and second places at the 1981 Bucknell Invitational.

Both the Bisons and unseasonably chilly weather played grim
hosts to the invitational field of Army, Bloomsburg, Lock Haven
and St. John’s. But the cool breezes and 40-degree temperatures
prevalent during Monday and Tuesday’s tourney proved no hin-
drance to Coach Jeff Ranck’s linkmen.

Senior captain Rob Wagner led the Orange team toa decisive vic-
tory by turning in two 18-hole rounds of 73-77 on the par 70 Bucknell
course, for a combined score of 150. Following Wagner was a close
pack of teammates—Kevin High ’82, Peter Orr ’84, Bill Francis ’83
and Jeff Buley ’82—who turned in scores of 155, 156, 157 and 171.

Bucknell’s Blue team placed second and was led by Bob Craig "83
with a round of 154, followed by Mike Stoyla ’82 and Rick Cramer
82, both at 155. Steve McFarland ’82 and John Stasko 83 rounded
out the Blue team’s scoring, posting 162 and 168 respectively.

The overall tournament results showed Bucknell dominating first
and second spots, with the Orange team having a stroke total of 618
followed by the Blue team at 626.

Wagner’s round of 150 led the field of 30 golfers as the Bison cap-
tain grabbed the individual low medalist trophy.

Other individual finishes were Craig in fourth place, and Stoyla,
Crammer and High tied for fifth.

According to Francis, ‘the win was really satisfying considering
the rough start we had. Both the Orange and the Blue teams played
well, proving that we can all play good consistent golf over a two-
day tournament, which will give us confidence for the upcoming
ECC s.” The East Coast Conference Championship will be played
in Elkton, Md., Monday and Tuesday.

Saturday’s tri-match was also a confidence builder. On the
friendly home turf of the University’s course, the Bisons bested
Lafayette and West Chester. Orr led the Bisons with a one-over-
par round of 71, followed by teammates Stasko and Wagner, both at
75, and High and Buley at 77 and 78.

Four unanswered fourth quarter goals give laxmen 16-14 win

By BILL BURKE

A thrilling fourth quarter surge gave the men’s
lacrosse team a narrow 16-14 victory over Lehigh
Wednesday night. Trailing 14-12 at the start of the
final period, the Bisons filled the net with four goals
while holding Lehigh scoreless.

In the first half, the Herd capitalized on 11 Lehigh
penalties and scored five goals with the one man ad-
vantage. Lehigh managed just one goal in three
penalty situations.

The Bisons, who outshot the Engineers 26-14 dur-
ing the first half, were sparked by the offense of
Junior Tri-Captain John Morris, who scored three of
the first five Bucknell goals. Despite the over-
whelming statistical advantage of Bucknell, the
half ended with Lehigh trailing by just three goals,
11-8.

The third quarter was all Lehigh, as the
Engineers fired in six unanswered goals before the
Bisons managed a goal by Morris with 13:32 gone in
the quarter. Bucknell was in the penalty situation
three times and Lehigh capitalized with a goal
every time.

Coach Sid Jamieson attributed the Bisons’ third
quarter troubles to Lehigh’s maintaining dominant
control of the ball and keeping the Bison ottense
from getting untracked. Jamieson also cited the
three damaging penalties as a contributor to the
third-quarter lapse. He said he was “‘surprised”’
that the Herd gave up as many goals as they did, but
he cited the young defense as the primary reason.

The period ended with Lehigh holding a 14-12 lead.

The Bisons’ comeback was initiated by an amaz-
ing goal by freshman Dave Brumbaugh, who
managed to scoop the ball into the goal out of a
crowded scramble in the dust in front of the Lehigh
net.

The Bison offense soon began to take charge
again, and sophomore John Alexander scored to
deadlock the game at 14.

A Lehigh penalty set the stage for victory, as Rink
Smith ’83 fired home what proved to be the winning
goal with 5:14 left to play.

The laxmen added an insurance goal minutes
later as Rob Mathai ’82 fed Smith who slammed the
ball into the net once again to seal the score at 16-14

Jamieson said he was pleased with the improve-
ment of the offense. ‘We decided to go back to our
basic offense. We had been trying some different
things, but we were throwing the ball away too
much, so it was back to the basics.” .

Morris and Smith were the offensive leaders for
the game, with four and three goals respectively.
Goalie Stu Berger ’81, who turned away 18 Lehigh
shots, was cited by Jamieson for a commendable ef-
fort. The Bisons raised their season record to 3-6,
while Lehigh dropped to 3-7.

The laxmen return to the field for their final home
game of the season against Drexel Saturday in what
Jamieson said he expects will be “another great
game.”

Firearms policy

By CINDY WARMAN

Controversy over the change of official
University policy concerning the use and
possession of firearms arose this week when
it was learned that — contrary to previous in-
formation — the Bucknell rifle range is open
and actively used by two rifle clubs.

Completion of the UC’s
third floor is approved

By MELISSA BAIR

The University Committee on
Planning and Budget unanimous-
ly agreed Wednesday to recom-
mend the completion of the third
floor of the University Center and
a glass enclosed dining room off
of the second floor to the Univer-
sity Board of Trustees.

The proposal will be presented
to the trustees for approval May
15 and University President Den-
nis O’Brien said he was
“prepared to go down in flames
with the trustees on this one.”

During the 90-minute discus-
sion, the committee evaluated
the proposal made this spring by
a special subcommittee which ex-
plored the development of the
third floor and the dining
solarium. The proposal for the
third floor includes plans for art
galleries, classrooms, a lounge,
a kitchen and storage rooms.

In addition to the Third Floor, a
glass enclosed dining solarium
was proposed to be built on the se-
cond floor adjacent to the 241 But-

tery rooms. The solarium is
designed to supplement the
cafeteria during lunch. With a
dining capacity of 200 students, a
lighter lunch of soups, salads and
sandwiches will be offered, ac-
cording to the proposal.

During the evening, the area
could be used for such events as
Christy’s Gate. Also, the room
will serve as a meeting area dur-
ing summer conventions.

According to the proposal, ap-
proximately one-quarter of the
third floor would consist of three
art galleries which would house
rotating exhibitions of the perma-
nent collection, a ‘changing’
gallery for contemporary art and
the Kress collection, which would
be moved from the Ellen Clark
Bertrand Library. That area in
the library would be converted in-
to additional shelf space and

The new policy, which banned the use or
possession of firearms on campus, was ap-
proved April 22 following Associate Director
of Residential Life Gerald Commerford’s
assertion that the rifle range was closed and
the University Rifle Club defunct.

study area.

The museum designated for
“changing” exhibitions could be
used for additional study areas
during the evenings, provided
that the security of the other two
galleries is adequate.

A kitchen area near the
galleries will serve for special
events such as workshops and
receptions, as well as other pur-
poses.

Offices for student organiza-
tions would be moved upstairs
from the second floor into a
larger room. The vacated space
on the second floor would be con-
verted into classrooms, ac-
cording to the report.

The area currently used for the
Center Gallery would become a

periodicals would be available.

New vice president will
be named by University

By MATT KARANIAN

A financial consultant for the University from the Marts and Lundy
consulting firm of New York City will be named to succeed John
Ferguson as the University’s vice president for University Relations,
sources within the administration said this week.

Charles Wolf, 60, will be officially named as the replacement for
Ferguson — who was asked to resign after one year on the job —
within the next two weeks and in time for his appointment to be of-
ficially approved by the University Board of Trustees at their May 15
meeting, the sources said.

The decision to hire the new vice president was reached ‘“‘this past
week,” according to University President Dennis O’Brien. O’Brien
said his office has been working for the past four weeks to reach a set-
tlement, and, although they knew they had a “man for the job’’, there
was a ‘question of working out conditions.”

O’Brien refused to reveal the name of Ferguson’s successor during
an interview Thursday, however, and said he plans to announce the
name of the new vice president officially by May 15.

Wolf is expected to take over the vice-presidency July 1 following the
formal departure of Ferguson June 30.

Rooney packs gym
with speech on the
uses of language

By MARY LISA MURGIANO

More than 1500 students, faculty and area
residents packed Davis Gymnasium to hear CBS
news writer and producer Andy Rooney speak on
“The Uses of the English Language’? Tuesday
night.

Spentitiy a “Bison” necktie given to him that
evening, the ‘60 Minutes” pundit balanced a sense
of humor with the seriousness of his talk as he
discussed — among other things — what he con-
sidered to be the superiority of the English language
despite its frequent misuse.

According to Rooney, English is the most
democratic and most concise language but is not
perfect. ‘‘How can a language that’s perfect spell a
word c-0-l-o-n-e-1 and pronounce it kernel?” he ask-
ed.

Although Rooney said there is ‘no doubt about the
decline of the English language,” he said foreigners
who choose to move to the United Slates should
“drop their native language in exchange for the
benefits of our country.”

Rooney prefaced a criticism of “Black English”
by saying, ‘If there is anyone I haven’t yet offend-
ed, I will offend them personally afterwards.” He
called black English ‘“‘an insult to blacks — the im-
plementation of the language implies that they’re
not smart enough to speak English.”

The second half of Rooney’s hour-long speech con-
cerned writing for television. “I can write for televi-
sion because there is a limit. I’m not overwhelmed.
It’s strange that more established writers don’t
want to share their words with pictures,” Rooney
said. He also attributed a shortage of television
writers to the popularity of the more attractive jobs
of television producers. ‘‘A producer receives more
money and status for easier, less creative work,”’ he
said.

Faculty takes first steps

Tuesday night in Davis Gymnasium. Rooney
mixed humor and seriousness in the final
speech of the Class of ‘53 Lectureship.

The humorous columnist commended former CBS
News President Richard Salant with standing up to
top executive and ‘‘forcing them to respect the
news.” Rooney said Salant has worked hard to keep
the news division of CBS autonomous.

Salant was one of the first speakers along with
former CBS Vice Chairman and President Frank
Stanton February 26 in the Class of ’53 Lec-
tureship, and he has been the driving force behind
the acquisition of speakers for all four programs in
the lectureship.

Rooney’s appearance was originally scheduled
for the University Center Forum.

Surveys distributed
to assess priorities

By JANET WILLIAMS

Two surveys intended to deter-
mine the University’s priorities
and goals for the upcoming
decade and to plan for the
University’s multi-million dollar
capital campaign have been
distributed to students, members
of the faculty and administration
and the University’s Board of
Turstees.

Chairman of the Campaign
Planning Committee and Pro-
fessor of Mathematics David Ray
said his group’s Survey on Ex-
isting Needs was conducted
because the committee is “trying
to pull together a needs list for
the upcoming fund-raising cam-
paign.”

According to Ray, the 17-item
survey — sent to more than 300
members of the faculty and ad-
ministration and the ABS Steer-
ing Committee — was derived
from two reports distributed by
President O’Brien: a 1981 draft
report of the Committee on
Priorities for the ’80s and a 1975
document on academic needs.

The questionnaire asks that
respondents evaluate the
desirability of 16 diverse items
such as new residence halls, an
addition to the Ellen Clarke Ber-
trand Library and endowment for
faculty salaries. An additional
question asks for a description
of any University-wide depart-
mental or professional needs not

covered elsewhere in the survey.

The other survey—which was
sent to students, members of the
faculty, administration and
board of trustees—is designed to
“evaluate the interests and
aspirations of students, faculty
and staff’? and ‘establish our
priorities and goals for the com-
ing decade,” University Presi-
dent Dennis O’Brien said in a let-
ter accompanying the survey.

Provost Wendell Smith, a
member of the committee who
orignally suggested that such a
proposal be conducted, said all
the responses have not yet been
returned. Smith said the com-
pleted surveys will be sent to ETS
in about 10 days and “hopefully
returned within two to three
weeks.”

Chairman of the Committee on
Priorities and Professor of
Psychology Roger Tarpy said
after ETS has scored and evalu-
ated the results, the groups ‘‘will
try to write a preliminary report
this summer” and possibly pre-
sent it to the trustees at their fall
meeting.

According to Ray, the
responses to the Campaign Plan-
ning survey will not be tallied un-
til after May 10. After the results
are evaluated by the committee,
a report will be presented during
an open forum.

in passing writing proposal

By LISA CERUTI

The University faculty passed the first
to parts of the 12-part proposal for a
University - wide writing program by re-
sounding voice votes Monday, setting the
stage for the adoption of the rest of the
plan’s points this week.

After the heated and evenly split first
debate on the controversial plan the
week before, the overwhelming approval
for the writing curriculum from the 80
voting faculty present at the special
faculty meeting Monday came as a sur-
prise to many. And it helped the plan
clear an important psychological hurdle
that those close to the debate think the
writing program’s opponents — most
noticeably from the Department of
English — will have a difficult time
rebuilding.

Chairman of the Faculty David Ray
said he doesn’t see a shift in the number
of faculty members who now support the
proposal as compared to the number at
the beginning of the debate. “‘The people
who speak out are always the same ones
but we can never tell how those who re-

“PHILIP WITHIM

main silent will vote.”

Chairman of the Committee on Instruc-
tion, Joseph LaBarge, agreed, and said
he “expects that things will go more
quickly with the remaining motions than
they did with the first one.

“The rest should fall in place now,” he
said:

Although the motions that would create
the program and its administration are
being voted on individually, the faculty
does still have the option to reject the en-
tire plan once the debate and ballotting
on each of the dozen parts is finished.

The first motion passed calls for the
establishment of a University - wide
writing program and stipulates that in
order to graduate, each student must
complete the program by passing one
writing course in each of three
categories.

There was still some diehard opposi-
tion to this motion from at least six facul-
ty members, with the English professors
still divided over the issue. Some
reiterated the arguments presented at

MICHAEL HANYAK

last week’s meeting. Professor of Eng-
lish and History Michael Payne called
it ‘“‘an abstraction in the worst sense
which doesn’t speak to the specific needs
of Bucknell.”

Professor of Mathematics and
Astronomy Emil Polak questioned his
own ability to evaluate an essay and said
he foresees a problem if professors who
teach the writing courses are not trained
in such instruction.

Associate Professor of English Philip
Withim, a member of the Instruction
Committee, defended the proposal in
response to Polak’s question. ‘‘Writing
instruction cannot be handled by the
English department alone — anyone who
can teach writing, should,” Withim said.

Assistant Professor of Chemical
Engineering and Assistant Professor of
English Catherine Smith, two other com-
mittee members, joined Withim in lobby-
ing for the motion from their position in
the front row of the University Center
Forum, where the group has sat en
masse during the debate.

CATHERINE SMITH

Associate Professor of Religion and
Coordinator of Graduate Studies William
Becker moved to amend the first part of
the proposal by eliminating the require-
ment for every student to pass one course
in each of three categories, but the
amendment was defeated by voice vote.

The second part of the proposal was
passed after little debate and one motion
to amend it was made. Associate Pro-
fessor of English John Murphy moved
that each Department or Major be re-
quired — rather than asked, as stated in
the proposal — to develop one or more
courses in the writing program.

Although the amendment was sup-
ported by Professor of Political Science
and Religion Douglas Sturm, University
President Dennis O’Brien and others,
Ray ruled that it was not in order since
its nature required consideration and
discussion prior to the meeting.

Voting on the remaining ten motions of
the proposal will continue Monday at the
faculty’s regularly scheduled. monthly
meeting.

Student clubs divide $74,386

Of 61 organizations, 10 appeal spring appropriation decision

BY BILL THUM
Of the 61 clubs and organizations dividing close to
$75,000 in the ABS Appropriations Committee’s
spring action last weekend, 10 groups are appealing
the decision on their request.

The committee — which is charged with the
distribution of the funds raised through the Student
Activities Fee of $52 per student next year — was
forced to pare more than $50,000 from the $125,778
requested by campus groups.

“Tt was an enormous task to evaluate all of the re-
quests in light of the limited funds available for
distribution,” ABS Treasurer Andy Brody ’82 said.
“Many believe the committee just sits down and
makes decisions. Actually a lot of information
gathering is done by all the members before the
distribution process begins,” he said.

Although many of the organizations making ap-
peals expected cuts to be made, many of the club’s
leaders still said the committee’s decisions reflect a
lack of accurate information concerning the needs
of specific programs.

The Bucknell Jazz and Rock Ensemble request
was cut from $5,074 to $1,000, and BJRE Manager
John Stillman ’81 said the group was “rushed
through its hearing. Brody said the committee
didn’t understand several points of the request as a
result of the five-minute meeting. After cutting
funds for our spring tour, they neglected to make
the resulting cuts in anticipated revenues and thus
we actually got a negative appropriation.”

Another group appealing the decision is Current
Concerns, formerly known as Interaction and
Diversity. Treasurer Joanna DiMario ’81 said, ‘‘the
committee makes cuts without understanding what
the programs are for. The 10-minute presentation is
afarce.”

Bucknellian Editor David Hawkings ’82 also said
the newspaper would appeal the committee’s “in-
complete’’ appropriation of $2,181 from the $10,583
requested. ‘‘The paper generates 70 percent of its
income from advertising and off-campus subscrip-
tions,” Hawkings said, ‘‘and the funds we requested
should really be considered a student subscription
rate of about $3.50 for the year.”

“I don’t think that’s too much to ask students to
pay for a weekly newspaper of the Bucknellian’s
quality,” he said.

Brody said, however, that the final funding for the
paper would almost certainly be increased after
committee members had made another review of
its salary expenses and capital improvement re-
quests.

Other groups appealing include campus radio sta-
tion WVBU, the Tristram literary magazine, the
Congress of Business Students, the French Club, the
American Society of Chemical Engineers, the
American Society of Mechanical Engineers and the
Japanese Club.

Brody said although many groups were not
pleased with the cuts, the amount of funds available
severely limits the committee’s actions. While the
activities fee generates $161,200 and returns from
the previous year add an additional $19,125, fixed
allocations including the ABS scholarship, the Com-
mittee on Student Programs and support of the four
classes remove $27,900.

Fixed appropriations such as those for the
Bucknell Student Lectureship, the ABS Jan Plan
fund and the Committee on Student Programs
deduct another $59,213 from the amount available to
campus groups, Brody said. He said that with a
total of $93,212 available for the spring hearings, the
funds distributed leave only a $19,826 margin for ap-
peals and additional appropriations.

Wolf tosucceed Ferguson

From WOLF, page 1.

The delay in the public announcement of Wolf’s position with the
University is being made ‘‘in deference to his current employer,”
O’Brien said. Referring to Wolf only as the ‘new vice president”,
O’Brien said he has ‘‘current commitments” that preclude formal an-
nouncement of his hiring until May 15. Sources said he has yet to make
final his termination plans with Marts and Lundy.

Wolf’s first association with the University came when he served as
a Marts and Lundy consultant from 1977-1979 while the firm was help-
ing Bucknell raise money in its $3.5 million fund drive for the
Sports/Recreation Complex. Marts and Lundy will once again be serv-
ing as a consultant to the University during its $30-$50 million capital
campaign for the 1980s, and several administration officials expressed
pleasure at the prospect of a strong link between the firm and the
University.

O’Brien said several candidates for Ferguson’s post were inter-
viewed here and in New York this spring, but this appointment has left
him “delighted.”

Faced with a history of high turnover in this office — three men have
served as vice president for University Relations in the last four years
— O’Brien said he expected Wolf to remain in his post “until his retire-
ment.”

O’Brien said the University Relations office has been notified of the
hiring, and several in the fundraising division said they were “ex-
cited’’ by the announcement.

In response. O’Brien said the
completion of the third floor does
not represent a new priority but
rather the fulfillment of one
begun 10 years old. O’Brien said
the development of other
priorities such as science
laboratories would require exter-

sion of the existing debt of $1.8

Haig contradicted
by the White House

In response to Secretary of
State Alexander Haig’s state-
ment that a total trade embargo
would result from an invasion of
Poland by the Soviet Union,
White House officials said Mon-
day this was only one of many op-
tions.

Haig said Saturday any inter-
nal or external aggression by the
Soviet Union would result in an
“across-the-board” trade cutoff.

Haig’s comments came the day
after the Reagan Administration
announced the end to the 15-
month-old curb on grain exports
to the Soviet Union. Haig had
made no secret of his opposition
to this position prior to its
release.

U.S. criticized by
Japanese official

Japanese-American relations
are in conflict resulting from the
United States’ failure to inform
Japan of the end of the 15-month
curb on grain shipments to the
Soviet Union.

Prime Minister Zenko Suzuki
— who will visit Washington next
week — criticized the United
States for not asking Japanese of-
ficials about their views on the

The judgment of bribery and

Maryland taxpayers to reclaim
money allegedly paid to Agnew

Lyons Shop to close

Photo—Carl Jensen

by June

After 31 years in business, the Lyons Shop and its subsidiary
Bath-A-Bed are expected to close by June 1.

The owners, Robert and JoAnne Lyons, said their decision to
close the shops at 318 and 320 Market Street was because of their in-
volvement in many other activities, including civic affairs.

The Lyons said the store, which opened in May of 1950, was in-
tended to cater to the tastes of college students at Bucknell and Sus-
quehanna Universities. The shop was featured in a September 1961
Cosmopolitan article entitled ““How to Start a Little Dress Shop.”

The portion on The Lyon’s Shop, entitled

“Know thy

Neighborhood,” recounted how the Lyons developed their business
from the time of establishing the store to its initial, early successes.

Mr. Lyons, a full-time instructor at Williamsport Community
College and operator of a retail consulting business, declined to
disclose plans for future use of the building.

sent a lecture entitled ‘Three
Mile Island—A Personal
Perspective” in the Vaughan
Literature Auditorium at 8 p.m.
Tuesday.

Stello is serving as director of
the Office of Inspection and En-
forcement for the NRC. He
played a major role as a senior
NRC representative during the
accident in Unit 2 of Three Mile
Island, in March 1979.

Stello received both the
bachelor of science and master of
science degree in mechanical
engineering from Bucknell.

EDITORIALS

Third floor encounter

At the risk of being premature, we must express our jubilation
and satisfaction that one of the few goals common to the campus for
the past 10 years — the completion of the third floor of the University
Center — is finally reaching culmination.

Although some of us will not be around to experience its use, we
can all leave happy with the knowledge that in some small way we
helped to bring about its completion. But perhaps even more impor-
tant than the UC’s imminent maturity is this knowledge that a
rather rare method of teamwork was used by the administration in
the formulation of a proposal which will permanently affect all of the
members of the University community.

From the beginning of the development of this plan, students,
faculty and administrators worked in concert, actively giving and
taking to produce something acceptable — if not available — to all.

For too long, students and faculty leaders have bemoaned the
lack of input which has existed in the formulation of University
policy, but clearly the spirit at the meeting of the University Com-
mittee for Planning and Budget Wednesday was one of mutual and
rather unexpected excitement; after all the talk and delay, all had
some say in this happy project.

Like drowning men

We’re not sitting here this morning to take advantage of a
somewhat unique opportunity we have to whine publicly about our
not getting the funds from the student coffers we think we deserve.
We understand why the ABS Appropriations Committee decided to
give us the “incomplete” partial funding of about one-fifth what we
had asked for, and we are confident that — once they are given the
proper information in a more relaxed setting — they will respond by
giving us at least close to the $3.50 subscription fee per student we
think we are worth.

We are taking this opportunity to raise some concerns about the
nature of the appropriations process, though. These concerns should
be made readily apparent by the phrase offset by dashes above;
namely, we think there’s been both a lapse of proper information
and a dirth of time for that information to be transferred.

The two, of course, are intimately connected. Given only 10 or 15
minutes to outline and answer queries on a year’s budget, we are
forced to feel like drowning men watching our life pass before our
eyes: we’d like to relive every moment again in its entirety, but
there just isn’t time.

Suggestions—if not solutions—for the alleviation of the problem
are many and complicated, and may involve an involved rethinking
of the process of ‘‘passing the bucks’? — more involved even than An-
dy Brody’s already felicitous endeavours. But the process of divvy-
ing up the $166,400 pie is something we’re all already involved in.

Thinking theater, Part Z

You walk into Political Science 150 and get barraged with the
ideals of Marx, Locke and Rousseau. The professor presents the
ideas because they will help you to learn to think; the political views
are secondary to the development of an ability to evaluate and ap-
preciate thoughts formerly foreign to your own.

A similar experience occurs in the theater. You relax, stretch
your mind and experience the ideas, emotions and events creatively
and artistically portrayed for your reflection.

Which leads us to “Minamata.”

The controversy over whether to present Jeffry Walker’s pro-
jected play is a healthy one, for we wouldn’t want Cap and Dagger to
approve plays suggested for the Coleman main stage without first
thinking about their place in the community. What is worrisome is
ae oo decisionmakers don’t have more faith in their own in-
erests.

“Minamata” is by its nature a political statement — on that
brings the viewer into confrontation with potentially controversial
views. Its value will not come from the performers’ ‘actual’ sup-
port of the message, but rather from the performers’ ability to con-
vey the notion for the viewer’s quiet judgment. Clearly the synthesis
of talents in the creation of ‘“Minamata”’ will provide a needed break

and an enormous educational experience for those accustomed to

merely interpretive theater: re >

A shining success is result of many

To the Editor:

The Handicap Awareness Week
at Bucknell April 19-25 was a suc-
cess thanks to a ton of people.
Focusing on the word “‘success,”
if only one person became
educated and aware—or if even
one child’s face shone on Kids’
Day—the week in my eyes will
have gone well beyond the word
“success.”

I feel strongly that this in-
creased awareness was ac-
complished in a respectful, un-
sympathetic manner.

IT enjoy life and Bucknell and I

am fighting for all who have
physical and mental limitations
so that they too can know the joy
of life, if they do not know it now.
People who learned will carry
that spirit to others, and I will be
working on more Handicap
Awareness Weeks—here and
elsewhere. We have the knowl-
edge to solve our problems if we
have the will. This is our shining
hope, and it begins with each of
us.

The most important reason for
writing this letter was not only to
talk of HAW’s success, but to
thank you all. I believe in giving

credit when it’s due, and it s over-
due here. Thanks go first to Betsy
Fisher, who helped carry out my
ideas. Also to Ruth Burnham, my
advisor who did more than
seemed humanly possible, and to
Beth Sipple and Marina Pappas,
who put their ‘“‘hearts’’ into the
event. I also thank the entire Con-
cern and Action gang, the ABS,
and many other students, faculty
and staff. Everyone’s help is very
much appreciated; without you,
this event would never have oc-
curred.

To the Editor:

Sexist event challenged

To the Editor:

Sig Derby was supposed to be the start of a new era. Very reluc-
tantly, representatives from Sigma Chi agreed upon some changes
so that the sororities would participate.

The first major change the sororities asked for was on the Der-
by Chase. The amount of violence had grown to the point that
Panhell felt that the event required major alterations to insure the
safety of the pledges. Hours of work resulted in a compromise
which included no points for derbies, referees and a penalty for
violence.

The second problem occurred with the skits. It was clearly stated
that the sororities would not have to degrade and humilate
themselves in order to win this event. It was decided that the skits
would be replaced by a talent show and lewd actions would not be
encouraged by Sigma Chi.

These two concessions were quickly forgotten hours after they
were agreed upon, by both Sigma Chi and the sororities. The Derby
Chase was held as always, the referees having little effect on the
violence. The ‘‘Talent Show”’ (the title accompanied by a laugh)
turned out to be exactly the same as before. The only formal
restriction was on criticism of other sororities. Sigma Chi still en-
couraged crude comments and suggestive, degrading behavior.

It is about time sororities realize what they are doing. Eight
groups of educated, liberated women are participating in a morally
degrading and sexist event that fosters hard feelings between the
sororities. I challenge the Panhellenic Council and the individual
sororities to truly unite and change Sig Derby effectively into a

Once, there were several people who desired to
write for the Bucknellian. Now they do not dare.
Now there are some who hesitate to even answer
Bucknellian questions because one never knows
what words will be twisted, added or omitted.

Last week’s issue had some surprise publicity
about the Women’s Issues Teach-In. The article that
appeared was a long way from the author’s original.
To set the record straight: Laura Kinney said the
words attributed to Nina Kaminsky. My words took
the very convenient form of an accusation rather
than a simple observation about this campus.

The Bucknellian staff attached the sexist ‘“‘label’”’
to Steve Diorio’s cartoon. I was referring to the in-
famous ‘“‘mock’’ issue. Last year’s masterpiece is
preserved on microfilm. You can go to the library
and drool over the “tasteful” verbal and pictoral
caricatures of women.

As a response to the ‘equal coverage”’ in this arti-
cle and to others who justify their behavior on the
grounds that it is funny, I would like to point out that
because people are not supposed to be offended by
jokes, humor is a particularly subtle way of “‘keep-
ing woman in her place.” Sig Derby provides a
hilarious situation in which women degrade
themselves and worship men. Kress T-shirts are a
barrel of fun and the legs contest of Sig Derby
causes uncontrollable laughter.

While these individual phenomena may not carry
immediate consequences, they create a climate ex-

you choose to do in your spare time is political and
what you choose to laugh at reflects your politics.
The humor on this campus reflects an attitude
which says women are available for men to judge,
mock or play with, at will.

P.S. I suppose the cure for the “‘archtypical in-
feriority complex,’ the latest rare disease at-
tributed to women, is to subject ourselves to as
much sexism as possible so we can build up an im-
munity and come to think of it as natural.

Sunrise service was
a great joint effort

To the Editor:

I want to express my thanks to the representatives
of all four Christian groups on campus who worked
to prepare the successful Easter sunrise service
April 19. The service was joyful, meaningful and in-
spirational, but also significant was the fact that all
four groups could work together.

Their unity was commendable, and I hope that this
effort is only the first of many successful joint ef-
forts of Christians at Bucknell to work together as a
whole for a common goal.

It is discouraging to see our stu-

abominations as spelling a per-

Alumni Class vice president April

that isn’t even close.

I’ve accepted misspellings
before. I’ve seen Monastersk,
Monski and sometimes Monas-

throw a major party and turn as
green as my pants. So I can ac-
cept misspellings; we ethnics
have come to accept this in a
world full of Smiths and Whites
and Halls.

Trampled bloss

By Todd G. Buchholz

a ee Sa

In every era, historians will tell
us, there are myths and theories
that hold societies together. And
as these principles are disproved
or debased, new civilizations are
born.

When Copernicus contended
that the earth was not the center
of the universe; when Darwin
stated that Genesis was balder-
dash; when Apollo 11 proved the
moon was not made of cheese—
these were overpowering events
in history.

After sober contemplation and
incantation, I have decided that
this week we have witnessed such
a revolutionary turn. Before I
divulge the answer I warn car-
diac patients to sit down.

The Cherry Blossoms are out
and are being trampled on the
walkway before the parents have
arrived.

The theory that John Zeller

controls the weather and Mother
Nature has been smashed! We
are free from his grasp, and from
the rumors that steroids are used
to program the blossoms. Some
had even suggested the purpose
of the new computer center is to
program Spring in Lewisburg.

Because the blossoms have
escaped from Zeller’s domain,
the admissions department is
worried. Polls show that the over-
whelming reason why students
choose Bucknell over Harvard is
that they prefer cherry blossoms
to ivy. Without the cherries, we
are as barren as Yale in New
Haven.

Complicating the case are the
daffodils, which also decided to
break the chains of serfdom and
bloom early. Again, Admissions
Director Richard Skelton and the
math department have deter-
mined that the percentage of
students who choose Bucknell is
directly proportional to the
percentage of daffodils that burst

into bloom.

Take a look at Freas Hall—the
daffodils have wilted and died.
Brenda Gordon is already offer-
ing the Freshman quad to the
Lewisburg Farmer’s Market.

The time-tested principle that

He can write, but his grasp of
English language is dubious

By Alian W. Grundstrom

Regrettably for Dean Chamber’s kind introduc-
tion, and for all of us who were in Davis Gym-
nasium Tuesday evening, Andy Rooney’s common
sense did blink that night. In fact, its lids were
tightly sealed for a third or more of his lecture.
When Rooney spoke about writing and about the
media he was humorous, serious and informative,
but when he extended his comments to the nature
of language—especially of English—his ideas
were naive.

He foolishly tried to demonstrate that English
was the best language in the world—a dubious
task. His criteria for awarding the prize to his own
language were: English has the most words, it has
the richest literature, it is the most concise, and it
is the most democratic.

Does having more words make a language bet-
ter? I doubt it, but it doesn’t really matter because
every language has the internal mechanisms to
create new words forever. It is helpful to writers
to know many words, but writers are not the same
as languages.

English is the medium of a very rich literature,
but comparisons with other literatures can only be
impressionistic and insulting to other peoples.

Even if such comparisons were valid, they would
speak to the quality of writers, not languages.

E Rooney is consistent in his confusion. Concision,
like vocabulary and literature, is a quality of good
writing, not an evaluation of a language.

“English is democratic.’’ That is concise, but
not very clear. It seems to mean that it is spoken
by the people. Not so in other countries?

Rooney was at his most dangerous to society in
his comments on bilingualism and Black English.
There are few advantages to a multi-lingual socie-
ty, but it does seem democratic to allow children
to start their education in a language they can
understand. It may very well be the best way for
them to learn the standard American Rooney
wants for them. He was dead wrong in his
characterization of Black English as illogical. It is
a systematic, rule-governed, open-ended language
capable of expressing all the subtleties of life.
Every langauge has its own “logic,” unrelated to
philosophical logic.

I can only hope that Rooney will read a good
book on linguistics before giving any more
speeches on the topic.

Allan W. Grundstrom is a professor of French and
linguistics and is currently on sabbatical leave as
Chairman of the Department of Modern Languages.

parents cannot function in the
cafeteria. Providing us with
entertainment throughout the
weekend, this tradition is reaf-
firmed as parents go spinning by,
pushed from side to side, in and
out of lines, and finally to their
seats—without ever getting a
tray or a sample of Bostwick’s
best. And it’s a shame, because
the food is always better on
Parents’ Weekend.

Tomorrow, stand by the milk
machines and watch as
distinguished gentlemen and
ladies become helpless children
pushing the levers to the side,
down and across, and in and out
in order to get a drop. Eventually
they turn to each other and mut-
ter, “Oh, I’d rather have a
whisky sour anyway.”

I wonder what will happen at
the Synchronettes water show.
Each year a father mistakes the
fish formation for a mass drown-
ing, rips off his shirt, loosens his
tie, and dives in to save his
daughter. By this time, the girls

oms prove that Zeller has lost control

have moved into their net forma-
tion and the poor guy gets stuck
in the middle like a tuna.

Of course, there are other
myths that only parents hold.
They believe that the entire world
goes to sleep at 9 when they
return to their motels. So they tell
their child, ‘‘We’ll meet you at
7:30 for breakfast.”

“Ugh,” responds the college
student, who planned to visit the
bar and parties until 3a.m.

Sorry to shatter your myth, Mr.
and Mrs. Middle America. But
now you know why your child
crawls into the cafeteria and
calls you by his roommates’
parents’ name.

Well, I warned you again, this
is an exciting, dynamic epoch. I
don’t expect you to relinquish all
of your preconceptions. Cling to
the best ones.

For instance, I’m absolutely
sure the post office has been sav-
ing all of the packages and letters
from my friends, so they can sur-
prise me on my graduation.

Bucknellian Dilemma forces
the cartoonist to draw a blank

By Bob Kallin

Who reads the Bucknellian? Who needs the
Bucknellian?

In attempting to answer these questions, it
became a monumental task to conjure up one
redeeming factor about the campus chronicle other
than that it provides cheap bedding for those
myopic, wayward canines who defy state laws
(can’t they read the UC doors?) by settling for some
shut-eye while their caretakers devour Bison-
burgers.

Other than providing the Bag Man with additional
cargo or fueling the fantasies of budding arsonists,
what positive purpose does the Bucknellian serve?
Take heed! Past articles have caused turmoil
among the troops, dissension in the ranks and food
fights in Roy Grier ... Besides promoting the Ku
Klux Klan, this numb tabloid has given the BPC an
identity crisis and knowingly published sexist car-
toon strips (obviously an unresolved oedipal on the
part of the cartoonist).

To whom can we credit these disdainful jour-
nalistic atrocities? Who is responsible for making
misery of the printed word? Obviously, the source
of the problem lies with the totally insensitive, inept
crew of misfits that label themselves editors,
managers, writers, photographers and artists.

But as the Registrar’s office has argued, let us
give credit (just one) where credit is due—to the
Lou Grant of Roberts basement. The editor’s
managerial tactics have festered a staff infection,
causing the editorial board to turn over faster than
Gutenberg in his grave. When the major decision of
the week shifts from front page headlines to
whether or not to order pepperoni on the midnight
pizza, someone is destined to become frustrated.

But does the Bucknellian suffer from an inherent
personality disorder or is this wanton weekly sim-
ply sacrificing quality for quantity? The New York
Times has condensed its news policy into the seven

THE EARLY

words ‘‘All the news that’s fit to print.’’ However,
the Bucknellian seems to have adopted a modified
version—‘‘All the news that fits, we print’’—which
the production manager has affectionately changed
to ‘‘All this news gives the printer fits.”

The simple truth of the matter is that, as the
paper approaches press time, things get rather hec-
tic. The demand for copy swells, writers quit,
sources are confirmed (‘‘Bless you, Deep Throat’’),
photographers quit, typing and layout begins,
editors quit, managers quit and consultants quit. All
in all, a busy night for the pink slip and the red pen.
It is not surprising to see tempers flare as Fairs are
tempered by editorial decree (will they print this
piece?).

How are we to salvage this sinking ship? I can of-
fer no solution for improvement; there is no hope on
the horizon. My only suggestion is to enforce earlier
deadlines. By avoiding the necessity of an all-
weeker, the staff may adopt a more congenial at-
titude towards themselves and their work.

I, for one, would holster quill in quiver if asked to
draw a graphic for an opinions piece that arrived at
midnight on Thursday. Touche.

Bob Kallin, a graduate student in school psychology
from Owego, N.Y., has to have his tongue removed
from his cheek this week. Therefore, his article arrived
too late for him to draw the accompanying graphic.

Last year we conducted our

college campuses across the
nation in an effort to resolve
the eternal argument about
Lite Beer less filling’ or
tastes great’? This question
as you may recall was never
fully answered in our memo-
rable Battle of the Big Guys

commercial. After carefully
tabulating the results of last
year's contests, we found
that the majority of campuses
actually felt strongly both
ways. So sign up today to join

ANNE MCINTYRE
McIntyre appointed

new Tristram editor

Anne McIntyre ’82 has been ap-
pointed editor of Tristram for the
1981-82 academic year.

Chosen by current Editor Linda
Wolff ’6i, McIntyre began work-
ing on the poetry staff of the
literary magazine last fall. She
worked as assistant editor this
semester.

McIntyre said it is ‘‘too early to
tell’’ whether any changes will be
made in the present format of the
magazine and plans to appoint
staff members within the next
few weeks.

The present Tristram staff has
been ‘‘very pleased with the in-
creased number of submissions

and hopes it will
semester,” she said.

‘Red Shadow’ econ. rock & roll band
will give concert sponsored by BPC

By DANNY CRAVEN

The May Day Celebration sponsored by the
Bucknell Progressive Caucus will culminate at 10
tonight with a musical performance by two
doctorate-holding, radical economists from
Washington D.C.

The performers, Stephen Michelson and Ev
Erlich are members of Red Shadow, the Economics

radical economists that plays in the Washington
area and has produced two albums to date.
Michelson and Erlich—who in their musical careers
are known as Delta X and Beta Hat—are currently
on tour as an offshoot of the larger group.

Delta, who received his Ph.D. from Stanford
University, is a senior partner in the prestigious
Washington-based Econometrics Research Cor-

’ poration. Beta, who received his doctorate from the
University of Michigan, holds the position of Senior
Economist for the Congressional Budget Office.

Their music, says Associate Professor of
Economics Charles Sackrey, is ‘‘political, satirical,
and fun.’’ Beta and Delta sing about Marxism,
economics and politics with a sound that is reminis-
cent of The Beach Boys, The Rolling Stones and
Chuck Berry. Business Journal, in reviewing Red
Shadow’s first album Live at the Panacea Hilton
said it was “hilariously funny—even outrageous—
and, at the same time, well-equipped for a savage
political attack on the capitalist system.”

All of the songs to be performed tonight are
originals written by either Delta, Beta, or members
of Red Shadow. The titles and lyrics are obviously
Marxist-oriented and poke fun at Capitalist dogma.
Some of the more intriguing songs are: ‘‘Stagfla-
tion,” ‘Commodity Fetishism,” and ‘‘Understand-
ing Marx.”

The Cheep Amusement Band will follow the per-
formance by Red Shadow.

The play selection committee
of Cap and Dagger, the Universi-
ty’s theater organization, has ap-
proved the controversial but as
yet unfinished work by a member
of the theater faculty here for
performance next January.

At a meeting April 12, the 15-
member play selection commit-
tee voted to recommend to the
organization’s entire member-
ship Sunday that the group stage
“Minamata’”’ in the third slot of
four in next year’s University
Theatre mainstage schedule. The
play is the project of Visiting
Assistant Professor of English
and Theater Jeffry Walker.

The proposed ‘Minamata’
would make a political statement
opposing the dumping of mercury
by the Chisso Chemical Corpora-
tion into Minamata Bay, Japan,
and the decision to stage it in 1982
“did not come without controver-
sy,” Professor of English and
Director of the University
Theatre Harvey Powers said.

“ach Cap and Dagger produc-
tion reflects on the reputation of
the organization. Some Cap and
Dagger members felt that by put-
ting on ‘Minamata,’ the organiza-
tion would be endorsing a
political statement they don’t
support,’’ he said.

Members were also hesitant
because the script has not been
completed, Powers added.

Play Selection Committee
Chairman Cynthia Lempert ’82
concurred with Powers, but said
“People weren’t too happy’”’ with
Walker’s presentation of his
ideas at the April 12 committee
meeting.

“There is always some discus-
sion over plays, but in this case
people just got a little bit more
antagonistic towards one
another,”’ while discussing the
politicality of the work, she said.
In addition to the play selection
committee, several members of
the Bucknell Progressive Caucus
attended the meeting three weeks
ago to support Walker’s proposal,
and several theater organization

CYNTHIA LEMPERT

members said the BPC’s
presence sparked much of the
debate.

“There was also dissension on
the basis of the problems that
arose with Walker’s first produc-
tion — ‘Early Stages’,’’ Lempert
said.

“Early Stages’? was produced
here in March 1980 and featured
six students and Walker presen-
ting a collection of experimental
and improvisational skits and
solo performances, some of
which were criticized for their
overt political messages by both
Cap and Dagger members and
the audience.

“Though the play will be very
political, I think the University is
the place for that type of thing,’”’
Cap and Dagger President Dodie
Rippon ’82 said.

She explained that most people
voted for “‘Minamata’’ because of
its experimental nature, which
she said will help fulfill Cap and
Dagger’s goal of presenting a
varied slate for next year. The
names of the other three plays to
be mounted next year have not
been finalized.

Walker—who is presently on
tour as part of this semester’s
leave of absence — was

‘Postman’ is laden with many intense sexual symbols

Nicholson and Lange fiercely sensuous in performance

By JESSICA WEICHSEL

An impressive movie which contains vivid scenes, ““The
Postman Always Rings Twice’’ should not be missed.
Directed by Bob Rafelson and based on the novel by
James Cain, the film portrays two lovers made slave to
their animal lust for each other.

The film presents Jack Nicholson as Frank Chambers, a
vagrant with a crimimal past who travels through
southern California during the 1930s. Chambers stops at a
roadside gas station and restaurant and converses with
the Greek owner, Nick Papadakis, played by John Col-
icos.

Chambers accepts a job from Papadakis after seeing
the store owner’s beautiful wife, Cora. Frank and Cora—
portrayed by Jessica Lange—become lovers and, through
an intricate plot, kill Papadakis. The rest of the movie
details the consequences of the murder for the couple.

The film carries an intense message, which becomes ob-
vious as each scene progresses. Director Rafelson and
screenplay author David Mamet designed the scenes to be
laden with sexual symbols, and the audience can easily
see the relationship between Frank and Cora to be little
more than uncontrollable animal lust.

The most memorable scene takes place in the kitchen of
the restaurant when the two have their first sexual en-

counter. Rafelson achieves his fiercely sensuous message
by filling every frame with sexual images, taking in the
loaves of unbaked bread around the kitchen and the meat
knife Cora grasps in her frenzy.

Nicholson’s performance is reminiscent of his role in
“One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest.” His talent brings
strength and expression to a difficult character:
Chambers becomes both hero and villain through
Nicholson’s presentation, and the audience drifts between
hating him and feeling sympathy for him. In each shot the
power of Nicholoson’s eyes causes the viewer to feel the
frenzied passion or desperate pain Chambers feels;
Nicholson vividly portrays his uncontrollable passion for
Lange.

Lange brings beauty and powerful expression to her
role. The viewer can sympathize with this young woman
isolated in the squalor of existence with her immigrant
husband. The loneliness of life at the side of a California
highway compels her to attempt escape.

Colicos’ portrayal of Papadakis is convincing, but it is
difficult to believe that the Greek restaurant owner was
not aware of the affair between his wife and employee.

“The Postman Always Rings Twice” opens tonight at
the Campus Theatre. Showings areat 7 and 9:10.p:m:

Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange unleash the
passions that will compel them to murder in the
bold motion picture “The Postman Always Rings
Twice.” The movie opens at the Campus -Theatre
tonight with showtimes at 7 and 9:10 p.m.

Ultimate Mudsharks take four

of five in weekend tournament

Friday, May 1, 1981

anal so ass wo
Joe Theisen ‘80 outdistances Jeff Temple ‘81 in ultimate
frisbee practice this week. The Mudsharks are the second
seed in this weekend's Eastern U.S. tournament.

By KATE CROSS
Bucknell’s Mudsharks were a dominant force in
the Frisbee regional playoffs for standings last
weekend at Glassboro, N.J., winning four of their
five games.

The Mudsharks are seeded second for tomorrow’s
Eastern U.S. tournament in Purchase, N.Y. as only
the world champion Glassboro Gang scored more
total goals for the weekend.

After a loss in their first game to the highly
respected Jersey Jam, the Mudsharks rampaged
through their next four games, winning all handily
and racking up a total of 97 goals.

The altered zone defense effectively limited scor-
ing by opposing teams in the cold, windy weather.
Moving an extra man to midfield created a virtual
wall against the opposition’s efforts to score up-
wind.

The Ultimate Airspace and George Mason bowed
14-6 and 20-8 to the Mudsharks’ tight defense and ag-
gressive offense Saturday afternoon.

The Mudsharks walloped Bucks County, 33-6, and
the Philadelphia Frisbee Club, 25-8, Sunday. Team
member Rich Schaberg ’81 commented, ‘‘We
gained confidence as the weekend went on, and we
knew we could win.”

Bucknell and Glassboro, who have perenially
turned out top-rate lidspinners, copped the top four
positions with the Jersey Jam and the Seven Sages
of the Bamboo Grove. Sporting such seasoned
diskers as John Sinnenberg ’79, Bob Bruin ’78 and
Fid Speer ’79, the Sages showed great strength
Saturday, piling up 71 goals in three games.

“Individual performances by all players were
outstanding which was necessary in our man to man
defense,’ Britt Clayton ’81 said. ‘‘Intensity on
defense was the key to our game.”’

This weekend’s Eastern playoffs at Purchase,
N.Y., will be the spring’s big tournament, with
teams from the New England and Mid Atlantic
regions expected to participate. Invitations have
also been extended to clubs from the South and
Midwest.

Pair of water polo squads impress in BU tournament

By JEFF CROSS

“What a disappointing way to lose a
game” said goaltender Tony Paxton ’81 of
Bucknell’s senior squad after the conclu-
sion of last weekend’s water polo tourna-
ment in Freas Rooke Pool.

After pulling to within one goal of the
New York Athletic Club ‘B’ team on senior
Mark Gensheimer’s score with 30 seconds
remaining in Saturday’s championship
game, the Senior Uighurs went into a tull
court press in a desparate try for the tying

‘oal.
However, a three quarter length of the
pool shot eluded Paxton and all Bison
defenders to give the NYAC ‘B’ the title
with a narrow 6-4 victory in the unofficial
tournament.

Scott Schulte ’81 scored two of his
tournament-high 25 goals while classmate
Marc Corl notched the first Bison goal

The Uighurs reached the finals by
outscoring Cornell, the Philadelphia
Aquatic Club and the Bucknell Varsity by

a combined score of 52-13 and edging the
NYAC ‘A’ 13-12.

The Varsity—a group of players who
were mostly substitutes on the squad that
took seventh in the NCAA Championships
last fall—edged Navy, 10-6, Fordham, 9-6
and the NYAC ‘A’, 10-9. In addition to los-
ing to the Senior Uighurs 16-2, the Bisons
fell to eventual champion NYAC ‘B’, 12-6.

Tom Butler ’82, the assists leader on last
fall’s varsity, led the team with 12 goals in
the tournament, including six against For-

dham. Junior Dan Dougherty and
sophomores John Simone and Jeff Payne
chipped in with six apiece.

Freshman Scott Mutschler (with four
goals), sophomore Dan Goss (two) and
junior Dave Inglefield (one) also scored
for the Bisons.

Goaltenders Mile Hoffman ’83 and Bill
Porter ’84 were credited with 24 and 11
saves in the five games, respectively.

The tournament concludes the spring
season for the water polo squad.

BUCKNELL 3-1 IN CLASSIC—The Rugby Club, shown here in
action this fall, beat three collegiate teams last weekend
before losing 6-3 to Delaware in double-overtime at the
end of the Pennsylvania Rugby Classic. Delaware wenf-on
to lose in the finals of the tournament, played on the West
Fields. The 7-4 ruggers host Pennsylvania's champion Buf-
falo Valley squad here tomorrow afternoon.

Tennis tunes for ECCs;

is trounced in final, 8-1

By DAVE KIRKPATRICK

The men’s tennis team traveled to Lafayette Tuesday, losing 8-1
in its final dual match before the East Coast Conference champion-
ships at West Chester this weekend.

Coach Craig Reynolds’ netters should have known it would be a
long afternoon when, due to inclement weather, there was confu-
sion among team members over whether the match would be
played. As a result, one player missed the trip, causing the regular
line-up to be shuffled.

An injury to fifth singles player Mike Driscoll ’84 and a forfeit at
third doubles further hindered the Bisons’ chances. Last week, the
team recorded two tight wins, winning 5-4 over conference rivals
West Chester Monday and Delaware Friday. About the West
Chester match, Reynolds said, ‘‘We had to change the starting at
the last moment, and this earlier time led to some sloppy play.”’

Reynolds’ point was emphasized when the first three singles
players for Bucknell lost. The strong play from the doubles
tandems of juniors Bill Beneke and Scott Simpson and Driscoll and
Paul Adkins ’81 pulled the match out for the Bisons, however.

Starring in the Delaware match was first singles player Steve
Haas ’83, who “‘played his finest match of the year,” according to
Reynolds.

Bucknell streaked through the singles matches 4-2, but needed
clutch performances from Adkins and Driscoll in the doubles to win
the contest.

Looking ahead to this weekend’s ECC championships, Reynolds
said, ‘‘Dual meets are really only played to determine seedings for
the conference championships.”’ He picks Temple to win its sixth
straight crown, and considers Bucknell, Lafayette, and Lehigh
“very capable’’ underdogs.

Track excels in ECC tuneups

By MIKE DeBRAGGIO

The men’s track team finished
its preperation for this weekend’s
East Coast Conference Cham-
pionship meet with some fine per-
formances in two meets Friday
and Saturday.

Despite relatively poor racing
conditions, Bison trackmen
turned in some very impressive
marks at the Penn Relays in
Philadelphia last week.

Thursday night, Bill
Reifsnyder ’84 and Jim O’Shea
’81 ran IC4A-qualifying marks in
the 10,000-meter (6.2 mile) run.
Reifsnyder clocked in at 29:45 for
sixth with O’Shea five seconds
back in eighth. Sophomore Mark
Hulme, running the 5,000-meters
(3.1 miles), also met the IC4A
qualifying mark in his event with
a13th-place time of 14:25.

In action at Penn Friday,
junior quartermilers Rocky
Thompson, Steve Craig and
Michael Jackson all recorded 50-
second splits in their respective
legs of the 1,600-meter relay. The
fourth team member, Mike
Geraghty ’84, was tripped in his
leg, eliminating the Bucknell en-
try that could have possibly
finished third in its race.

Several Bucknell entries in
Saturday’s contests fared quite
well. Junior Rick Sayre recorded
the Bison’s highest finish of the

week-long meet in his specialty,
the 3,000-meter steeplechase.

Sayre finished second to Ken-
yon Solomon Chebor of Fairleigh
Dickinson. Chebor ran with the
pack for five laps and then
opened up a 20-30-meter lead on
the group with a strong, quick
move.

Sayre also broke with the pack
but was never able to make up
the deficit. His time of 8:46.5 was
more than eight seconds off
Chebor’s winning effort of 8:38.1.

In the javelin, senior Al
Wegener continued his recent im-
provement with a personal best
toss of 205 feet. Wegener has con-
sistently thrown over 200 feet all
season.

Bucknell athletes also com-
peted in a four-team meet at
Clarion State Saturday after-
noon. Although snow and wind
hampered most of the times on
the track, there were noteworthy
performances in the field events.

Freshman Steve Mackay
picked up a first place in the
discus with a toss of 131 feet,
while junior Mike Ward’s 48-foot
effort in the shot put was the
day’s best. Bill Miller ’84 took
another first for Bucknell with a
leap of 6-4 in the high jump.

Despite the conditions, there
were some good efforts on the
track where Paul Gutowski 82

won the high hurdles in 15
seconds and Mark Shaffer ’81
took the intermediate hurdles in
57 seconds.

Looking toward the ECC cham-
pionships at Lehigh this weekend,
Coach Art Gulden cited
“competitive attitude” as the key
to winning the title. ‘“‘We can
score in almost every event—the
question is whether we do or
not.’”’ Gulden also noted that it
will be important for his squad to
score some big points.

“That’s what hurts us in-
doors,” Gulden said. ‘We scored
in a lot of places, but there
weren’t enough of the big scores
we needed.”

The Bisons are not the favorites
in the conference meet. Although
Delaware is the three-time
defending champion, they are
more vulnerable than ever, ac-
cording to Gulden. The Blue
Hens’ strengths lie in the weight
and distance events.

Temple, the ECC indoor cham-
pion, scores heavily in the events
from the mile down and the
jumps; however, the loss of their
top sprinter figures to undermine
their strength considerably.

Bucknell brings in a more
balanced attack than they have in
the past few years. The Bisons
are capable of scoring—and scor-
ing big—in almost every event.

Lacrosse teams experience mixed success

~

Men edged 11-9 by Drexel; {

lose to nationally-ranked Army

By KEN QUAAS

It’s an exciting game as the underdog team battles tenaciously to
keep the highly-touted powerhouse in check. Suddenly, the favored
squad counters with an insurmountable onslaught and the game is put
out of reach.

The men’s lacrosse team has seen that movie, too.

Wednesday’s trip to West Point was another repeat for the laxmen
as 12th-ranked Army crushed Bucknell, 16-3. A 5-2 halftime edge
mushroomed into an inflated lead as Army blasted 10 goals into the
cage and the Bisons were only able to respond with one.

Bucknell seemed to droop early in the third quarter as the Cadets
came out charging and nailed three quick goals in the first minute and
a half of play. The Bison defense was caught off guard and never
recovered. As freshman defenseman Geoff Chenworth said,
“Everything went downhill after that.”

The laxmen saw their record fall to 3-8 as sophomore Rink Smith—
the second highest scorer on the team—tallied twice and Rodney
Brown ’83 once during the effort.

Army was not the week’s only disappointment as Saturday’s jaunt to
Philadelphia wound up as another setback for the Bisons. Conference-
rival Drexel was the host this time, and Bucknell did not seem ready to
play at first, with the Dragons jumping to an early lead.

But the offense responded and was led by junior Tri-Captain John
Morris, who tallied three goals. Leading scorer Morris put an edge of
excitement on the game as his third goal with 1:49 remaining in the
game brought the laxmen to within a goal of Drexel.

But the hometeam was not to be denied. The Dragons held on tight,
as Drexel’s Benson Goldberger slapped the ball into the net with seven
seconds left, and the Bisons were stopped, 11-9.

With two games to play, the lacrosse team will have to wait another
year to topple a Top 15 foe. But the season is far from over, as pre-
season conference favorite Delaware plays host to the Bisons Satur-
day.

The Hens have beaten Bucknell by one goal three years straight, and
as Senior Tri-Captain Stu Berger insists, “They’re the ones we really
want.”

Women capture first victory
with an 11-6 rout of Dickinson

By S. J. FURMAN

The women’s lacrosse team captured its first victory of the season
Monday by defeating Dickinson, 11-6, in Carlisle. The Bisons scored
seven goals in the first half and twice more in each of the final two
quarters.

According to Head Coach Sally Starr, the team’s 1-6 record is cer-
tainly “not indicative” of its performance thus far.

Against the Red Devils, the Bisons played a “good game” in which
both the attack and defense played ‘extremely well.” The team
showed better teamwork over past performances, as six of the 11 goals
were off direct passes.

Anne Kennedy 82 opened the scoring at the 1:44 mark with the

first of her three goals. She made it 2-0 four minutes into the game and
registered the team’s 10th goal 19:45 into the second half. Kennedy has
10 goals and one assist for the year, one goal behind team leader Nan-

cy Williams ’84, who also has five assists.

Williams was also a key in Monday’s win, with three goals and
three assists. Maria Procopio ’83 also notched three goals.

Defensively, senior Liz Rabenold was “outstanding,” according to
Starr, Rabenold’s ‘‘amazing” interception of a Red Devil pass led to

her first goal of the season, noted Starr.

Senior Ellen McCahon scored the other Bucknell goal and goal

tender Carol Schmidt ’83 recorded 12 saves.

Bison baseball falls three times in lopsided games

The baseball team was defeated in all
three of its games this week, losing to
Temple, 19-10, Monday and dropping a
double-header to Lehigh Saturday by
scores of 9-4 and 10-3. The losses give the
Bisons a 6-13 record.

Against Temple, Ed Hughes ’83 started
and took the loss as his record fell to 1-3.
The Owls pounded out 16 hits against four
Bison pitchers to raise their record to 21-8.

Sophomores Paul Bamford and Jim
Frantz drove home four and five runs,

respectively, with two hits each. Senior
Scott Dow also had two hits.

In the first game against Lehigh, six
Engineer runs in the first inning put the
Bisons in a hole they couldn’t get out of.
Bamford, Frantz and Carl Nablo ’82 had
two hits each and Dow had two RBIs for
the Bisons.

Tom Ganter ’81 saw his record dip to 3-2
with the loss, but Mark Glatz ’84 turned in
seven strong innings of three-hit relief.

In the second game. Lehigh again struck

early, taking a 4-0 lead in the first as Ken
Durr ’82 was victimized by poor defense.
Durr saw his record fall to 2-5 as the
Engineers increased their lead. Jim Smith
pitched the final three innings and struck
out eight, while giving up four runs.
George Kangos ’81 had two hits and Bam-
ford, Kangos and Bill Lawrence ’81 had
one RBI each.

Bamford’s four RBIs against Temple
gave him the team lead with 17. Dow leads
in hits (26) and average (.371) while

Frantz leads in runs scored with 11.

Dow and Lawrence have both passed the
career hit record of 76 set by Randy Ruger
*69 and are tied now at 79 with eight games
left. Dow has also set season and career
records for doubles.

Durr has been the leader of the pitching
staff, with an ERA of 3.86, two wins and
two saves. Ganter has three victories.

Lafayette travels here for a double-
header Saturday and Bloomsburg invades
for another twinbill Monday.

Security asks Union to
withdraw representation

By MATT KARANIAN

Less than a year after the officers of the Campus Security force
became the first Bucknell employees in history to unionize, the force
has unanimously requested the United Plant Guard Workers of
America to withdraw as their collective bargaining agent.

According to Security spokesman and unionization leader Cpl. Ed
Roberts, the eight men and one woman that comprise the force are
“dissatisfied” with the UPGWA, the giant union with whom they have
been negotiating a new contract for the security force since
September.

The UPGWA made a contract proposal in February which was
unanimously rejected by the officers here, Roberts said, and the force
wrote a letter soon after the union’s contract was rejected requesting
that they ‘“‘disclaim interest’ and cease to serve as the collective
bargaining agent.

“We didn’t think we were being dealt with straightforwardly”’ by the
union, Roberts said in an interview Thursday. The relationships be-
tween the officers and the union deteriorated to the point when the of-

Sexual harassment of wome

By BILL THUM

The Ku Klux Klan has for the
second time in a month cancelled
a scheduled visit to Lewisburg.

Pennsylvania Grand Dragon
Jim Locke, the state leader of the
Invisible Empire, Knights of the
Ku Klux Klan, said in an ex-
clusive interview with the
Bucknellian Wednesday that a
recruitment drive here scheduled
for Saturday had been called off
after he had received threats of
violence.

Locke said he had received
“threats that more than 200 pro-
testors from the Jewish Defense
League and Black Brotherhood of
America would violently oppose
any Klan appearance in
Lewisburg.”

Locke said although only 20
Klansmen would have par-
ticipated in recruitment, ‘‘more
than 300 Klansmen would have
come to Lewisburg for support—
with 80 percent legally registered
to use firearms.

“J would not bring my men into
a situation with such a great
potential for violence,” he said.

Although the Black
Brotherhood could not be located
and reached for comment, Na-
tional Director of the Jewish

Defense League Arno Weinstein
said the threats probably came
from Harrisburg. JDL Executive
Director Ed Ramov said, ‘‘while
we weren’t aware of the situa-
tion, we would have been willing
to violently oppose the Klan in
Lewisburg.”

Locke said the Klan would once
again reschedule its recruiting
drive for some time this summer.
He said he knew the Lewisburg
group, Citizens for Equality —
which had planned a counter-
rally — was non-violent and he
“hoped to sit down and discuss
with the group’s members the
various positions on the Klan dur-
ing his summer visit.”’

When informed of the Klan’s
decision to cancel their ap-
pearance at the Bucknell Pro-
gressive Caucus meeting Thurs-
day, group spokesmen said they
would still distribute pamphlets
in town Saturday despite the
Klan’s absence.

When asked about the possibili-
ty that the Klan’s involvement in
Lewisburg has been largely a
publicity stunt, Locke said, “I
can’t help what people think. We
planned the visits with the inten-
tion of recruiting members and
cancelled them when it was ap-

after threats of violence

parent a serious confrontation
could arise. We don’t care if you
agree with us, just as long as you
treat us fairly.”

Locke, a 50-year-old disabled
veteran from New Geneva,
discussed the Klan during an in-
terview Wednesday night.

“The Klan has_ historically
achieved growth during periods
of economic and social turmoil,
such as in the 1860s, 1920s, 1960s,

n here is not uncommon

By ANNE CLEMENS

The sexual harassment of female
students here by male students and faculty
— although not uncommon — is a problem
that frequently goes officially unreported,
according to various administration of-
ficials.

A list compiled by Campus Security of
all reported incidents involving “sexual
harassment” in this academic year
numbers 18, the most common of which in-
volve a male “‘prowler’’-type — described
variously as a “Peeping Tom,” a
“suspicious” male in or near a woman’s
dormitory or an actual intruder into a
woman’s bedroom or hall bathroom.

Eleven of these have been called to the at-
tention of Security since September, ac-
cording to the list.

The record, which was made available
to the Bucknellian this week by Vice Presi-
dent for Administration and Finance John
Zeller, also includes four ‘“‘assaults” rang-
ing from a man trailing a woman on foot to
physical conflict between a romantically
involved couple.

“National statistics on ‘sexual harass-
ment’ indicate that only one-tenth of such
cases are reported,” according to Assis-
tant Dean of Student Affairs Joe Mam-
mola. “I don’t know how accurate that is
for us, but probably many do happen and

go unreported.”

Director of Residential Life Brenda Gor-
don said she is ‘‘not clear on why women
don’t report incidents they do experience.”

The administration ‘‘can only deal with
the follow up on those incidents that are
reported,” Gordon said.

Mammola said, however, that the
University does intervene in appropriate
cases to say “this must stop even if the
woman does not want to do anything about
the harassment.”

Acting Director of Security and Safety
Mike Armarante said reported incidents of
sexual harassment ‘‘are few and far be-
tween’’ and that students’ behavior here is

“simply outstanding.”

When sexual harassment of any sort is
reported to campus Security, an incident
report is filed which goes to Zeller’s office,
the Office of Residential Life and-or the Of-
fice of Student Affairs. There are now of-
ficial policy guidelines for such cases
released by the University’s Equal
Employment Opportunity Committee and
published in the Bucknellian March 6.

Campus Security officer Donna Digin,
who was hired in January to fill a vacancy
on the previously all-male security force,
said she has had some schooling on rape
and harassment, and worked on such

New phone system

will be installed, at
last, for fall semester

By NANNETTE COOKE

The University will install a
new phone system this summer
which will enable students living
in University housing to dial
directly from their room phones
and accept collect calls 24 hours
aday.

Vice President for Administra-
tion and Finance John Zeller said
although students will be able to
dial directly—which was not
possible with the present closed-
circuit system—the new system
will require callers to dial seven
digits instead of four for on-
campus numbers.

The student in each room
whose last name comes first
alphabetically will receive the
monthly phone bill for the room’s
phone from the University which
is billed by the Buffalo Valley
Telephone Company. The billing
procedure is explained in Section

HARRY GARVIN

The University faculty passed the third,
fourth and fifth motions of the proposal for a
University-wide writing program Monday
despite a motion to postpone further discus-
sion and voting on the remaining motions
until October.

Although three parts of the proposal were
passed at the regularly scheduled monthly
faculty meeting, there is still opposition
from some faculty members, including Pro-
fessor of English Harry Garvin, who moved
in an impassioned speech. to table voting on
the pending sections. But his motion was re-
jected by voice vote.

The three parts passed Monday describe
provisions for remedial writing work,
upper-division credit for unconventional
courses and the duties of the Writing Center.

Garvin cited advantages for the Depart-
ment of English, the Committee on Instruc-
tion and the faculty in postponing further
voting until the fall. “Tf we postpone voting,
other members of the faculty would have a

posal,” Garvin said.

Acting Head of the Department of English
Dennis Baumwoll, who strongly opposes the
proposal, said he “doubts that people will
devote time to creating an alternative
writing program when one already exists.”

Garvin said ‘the Department of English
has been by-passed”’ by the Committee on
Instruction while the proposal was being
composed. ‘‘We saw drafts but those who
were originally in favor now oppose it
because we see it’s not what we would have
designed,” he said.

‘Associate Professor of English Tucker Or-
bison — supporting the Instruction Commit-
tee’s efforts — disagreed with Garvin, say-
ing “I don’t accept that the English depart-
ment has been by-passed. We’ve been con-
sulted at every turn.”

Much of Monday’s debate centered on the
“ambiguity” and the “need for clarifica-
tion” of the proposal. Garvin said during
discussion of the fifth motion that ‘perhaps

tion could transform the current proposal to
make it more concrete.”

In addition, Associate Professor of
English John Murphy asked for clarification
of the Writing Center’s “other duties” as
mentioned in part five of the proposal, and
Associate Professor of English Philip
Withim replied that “if the committee knew
what the other duties were, we'd put them
ae

English Department Chairman John
Tilton moved to amend the fifth motion of
the proposal by deleting the role of the ad-
ministration in assigning the “other” duties
of the Writing Center. Tilton called for “a
little integrity” and asked the faculty ‘not
to leave it open to the administration to
prescribe what the Writing Center will be.”
The motion to amend part five was passed.

Voting on the remaining seven motions of
the proposal will continue Monday at
another specially scheduled meeting.

and today. Many are confronted
with a collapse of our justice
system and grasp at straws for
support. Although some of our
membership comes from this,
many more join from a belief in
our ideals,” Locke said.

While official membership is
secret, Klanwatch, operated by
the Southern Poverty Law Center
in Montgomery, Ala., estimates
the Invisible Empire is the
fastest growing and most mili-
tant KKK group in America. Im-
perial Wizard Bill Wilkinson, who
broke from the older Knights of
the Ku Klux Klan in 1975 to form
the Invisible Empire, is describ-
“too much into weapons’’.

Locke said ‘‘Wilkinson is very,
very militant. While he doesn’t
advocate violence, he wants to be
prepared for the coming race
war. That’s why we love him.”

“While I dread the -thought,
particularly because of my
children, there is just too much
racial hatred in the world which
will inevitably lead to war. We
want to be prepared,” Locke
said.

Locke gave an example of the
determination of the Klan by
describing Klan justice: ‘‘Sup-
pose a man is convicted of seling
dope to elementary school kids.
Typically, he will be let off lightly
and continue his trade. The Klan
will not stand for this and will
first warn him to stop his ac-
tivities. The next step is to tar
and feather him, then finally

make sure he will never hurt our
children again. This is necessary
due to the ineffectiveness of our
judicial system.”

When questioned about the ex-
istence of a guerilla training
camp in Alabama, Locke con-
firmed this and said, ‘‘the camp
is not a training ground for offen-
sive tactics. Instead it is used to
instruct members in security
methods and weapons handling in
case a confrontation arises dur-
ing Klan activities.”

When asked if such a camp ex-
isted in Pennsylvania, Locke
refused to comment.

Locke said the greatest pro-
blem that faces our society is a
disintegration of the basic moral
values. “In the early ’60s,” Locke
said, ‘Soviet leader Nikita
Khruschev said he would over-
come this country without firing
a shot, instead attacking through
our society’s base.”

While Klanwatch reports that
attempts to recruit children are
one of the most poorly in-
vestigated aspects of the Klan,
Locke confirmed that the Invisi-
ble Empire operates a Youth
Corps in Pennsyivania.

‘Membership is open to youths
10 to 18 years old. An I.D. card is
provided for the $6 yearly fee
along with a set of business-like
cards imprinted with the ‘Get on
the Klan-Man’ motto. Members
also receive a monthly copy of
The Klansman, the Invisible Em-
pire’s magazine,” he said.

Locke said it was true that a

flyer distributed to children read
in part that, ‘‘an attempt is being
made to undermine young peo-
ple’s respect for the values of our
nation and race. Black studies
glorify mythological
achievements of the black race.
Christian values have been
replaced by Jewish history. Little
notice is given to the violence
against students by the black
savages who roam the corridors
at will. Murder of white students
by black students is on the in-
crease.”

Locke also confirmed that
youths are taught how to use and
care for firearms by the Klan.
“We follow the National Rifle
Association age requirement of
12 years old for the kids and
believe they should be
knowledgeable and responsible in
the handling of weapons whether
for hunting or protection.”

The Youth Corps program is
further directed towards organiz-
ing white youths along white
lines, a ‘“‘get-tough” policy with
arrogant non-whites and segrega-
tion of classes followed by even-
tual segregation of schools.

Locke agreed with the segrega-
tion requirement and said,
“every human being must have
freedom of choice — integration
is forcing students into associa-
tions they don’t want.’’ Locke
also supported Wilkinson’s state-
ment that ‘“‘segregation has work-
ed for 300 years and therefore
there must be something good
about it.”

Anew student handbook and course
guide is written by student groups

A new student handbook intended to “fill stu-
dent’s needs” is being written by student commit-
tees directed by the ABS Congress.

Bearing Bucknell will be published to supplement
the University’s present student handbook, which
“doesn’t do enough to guide student life,” according
to one of the guide’s four editors, David O’Connell
"82.

“The main point of the guide is that it’s being
written for and by students,” O’Connell said.

The handbook will consist of four sections: a short
history of the University including “strange facts
and interesting sidelights’”’, descriptions of student
organizations, a guide to “cutting through Universi-
ty red tape” and information about useful shops and
services in the Lewisburg community.

According to O’Connell, the project has received
$3,500 from the ABS Congress and editors are hop-
ing to sell copies to cover the costs of printing which

will probably be $3,900.

ABS President Michael Suarez ’82 is “formulating
a plan of action” to compile a course guide whose
“purpose is to inform students and also to en-
courage excellence in teaching among the faculty.”

Suarez said he, the rest of the Steering Committee
and other congress members will be organizing in
the fall to gather information on the University’s
courses and professors.

“The problem with the existing guide is that it
really doesn’t say what students have found out
about courses and professors.

“There is no hard data and students have to get
everything through the grape vine,” Suarez said.

Suarez said his committee will have the new
course guide written in the late fall of 1981 and it will
include descriptions of courses traditionally offered
for the fall of 1982.

By M.E. WEIL

The University will award honorary degrees to an NBC vice chair-
man, a former editor of Audobon magazine, an expert in Asian studies
and Captain Kangaroo May 31 at the 138th commencement exercises.

The Captain, Robert Keeshan, will receive an honorary Doctor of
Humanities degree. He is chairman of the Council of Governing
Boards, an organization of private college trustees in New York State,
and the chairman of the Board of Trustees at the College of New
Rochelle, in addition to being the first Clarabel on the original ‘Howdy
Doody Show.” His hour-long television series for children celebrated
its 25th anniversary on CBS last fall.

Richard Salant, a magna cum laude graduate of Harvard in 1935,
will be awarded a Doctor of Humanities degree in recognition of his
many achievements as a leader in broadcast news journalism. He was
president of CBS News until 1979 and introduced the first half-hour
news broadcast—‘‘The CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite” —
and the first television news magazine, ‘‘60 Minutes.” His name
became synonymous this semester with this year’s Class of 53
Lectureship—which brought Andy Rooney and Charles Kuralt to
Bucknell this spring.

The only Bucknell graduate who will receive a degree this year is
Mary McClelland Lago, to be honored with an honorary Doctorate of
Literature. She received her Ph.D. in English from the University of
Missouri in 1969 and has translated (from Bengali) and published the
poetry and prose of Rabindranath Tagore.

Les Line, who will receive a Doctor of Literature degree, is one of
America’s foremost nature photographers and is co-author and
photographer of two major studies, The Sea Has Wings and Seasons,
which he has written while Audobon editor.

Degrees were also offered to but declined by professional tennis
player Arthur Ashe, Frances Moore Lappe, author of Diet for a Small
Planet, Gordon Willis, one of the leading cinematrographers in the
film industry and David S. Broder, a political columnist for the
Washington Post.

Degrees are awarded “‘in order to recognize individuals whose work
exemplifies the qualities of intellect, character, and creativity most
cherished by the University,” according to objectives described in the
draft of the committee’s current ‘‘working policy.”

The selection of candidates for honorary degrees began in late 1979,
when the Committee on Honorary Degrees solicited nominations from
students, faculty and administration in What’s Happening and Notes
and Notices. According to Associate Professor of Psychology Gerald
Levin, the chairman of the committee, more than 100 nominations
were received.

Biographical information was collected and personal folders were
compiled, 30 of which were selected by the committee according to the

“working policy” outlined by the group, Levin said. Those candidates
According to Levin, an “average of five candidates and two alter-
nates are chosen each year and approximately one out of five do not

Faculty discuss
a new proposal
for curriculum

By LISA CERUTI

Dean of Arts and Sciences
Robert Chambers asked the
faculty of the College of Arts and
Sciences Wednesday for
“guidance”? on how -to proceed
with a working paper drafted by
the Special Committee on
General Education which
describes a program for cur-
ricular reform.

The ‘‘Proposal for General
Education”’ was presented to the
Arts and Sciences faculty at a
special meeting by members of
the committee. The draft
describes the group’s rationale
for a general education cur-
riculum, the academic major, the
perspective requirement and a
General Education Council — all
of which are tentatively included
in the plans for curriculum
reform.

The eight-member committee
was appointed in January by
Chambers at the request of the
faculty to come up with a
“proposal for reform that would
be both workable and stimulating
for students and faculty alike,”

ROBERT CHAMBERS

according to Chambers.

The informal discussion of the
proposal at the meeting was led
by Chambers and was concluded
with a request for written
remarks from the faculty about
the draft.

The ABS Congress passed a
position paper at its regular
meeting Monday which ‘‘en-
dorses the spirit of the proposal,”’
according to ABS President
Michael Suarez ’82. “The current
system of requirements needs to
be critically examined and we
will urge the committee to pursue
the development of the pro-
posal,’’ Suarez said.

Harassment is often unreported here

From HARASSMENT, page 1.

such cases while in the Army.
Since that time she has taken
some courses in psychology and
women’s psychology.

Digin said sheis “‘being utilized
for anything involving a female’
that the security force here is in-
volved in. ‘I think it’s good to
have a woman on the security
force because representation of
women here has been ignored un-
til now.”

In a series of interviews, the
Bucknellian was told of approx-
imately one dozen incidents of
sexual harassment involving
female University students that
have never been officially
reported.

One of these incidents — which
occurred in the fall of 1979 — in-
volved a then - sophomore
woman and her boyfriend on
their way to a fraternity party on
University Avenue. As they walk-
ed by a group of people convers-
ing outside one house, one
freshman in the group made a
comment, then reached out and
inserted his hand under the
woman’s blouse to grab her
breast, according to the woman.

While her reaction was to
“whack him hard across the
face,” her companion was too
stunned to react, and they con-

physically and emotionally” by
the incident, but she never
reported it.

Another such interview reveal-
ed an incident in May of 1979 in-
volving another sophomore who
was harassed by a since-re-
leased instructor of computer
science. While discussing the
final exam with the professor, he
put his arm around her and at-
tempted to kiss her, she said. She
pulled back and thought he had
given up, but he tried the same
thing again a few minutes later.

She pulled back again, said “‘I
think we’re done talking — I’ll
call you about my grade on the
final,” stood up and left the room,
according to the woman.

She said this incident was
never reported because she was
“Jeaving the next day and still
had another final to take.”

There is one known case of an
incident involving an assault of a
woman by an acquaintance of

hers in May 1980 that was
reported to Campus Security but
cannot be found in their files.
Gordon and Mammola
discovered Security had no
report on that case when inform-
ed of the attack by the victim last
fall and checked Security’s
records to determine why they
had not received a report.

Neither Gordon, Mammola or
Zeller had any explanation for
the missing file. Each said they
had no reason to suspect anyone
of deliberately suppressing the
information and considered it to
be “‘a fluke.”

As to the possibility that
someone may have “‘pulled”’ the
file that is now missing or in any
way suppressed information that
would result in an increased
security risk for women, Mam-
mola said, ‘“‘Anyone who would do
that should be fired. I believe
that.”

ficers ‘‘didn’t have any trust” in them, he said.

Roberts—who has been sitting in on the negotiations between the
union and the University as the security officers’ steward for the
union—said “‘it was like I was negotiating against Bucknell and
¢ against the union at the same time.”’ He said the officers “didn’t have

tional Labor Relations Board two weeks ago, and Vice President for
Administration and Finance John Zeller told the Bucknellian this mor-
ning that he had received word from the NLRB today saying that the
union’s certification here had been removed.

“Now it’s official,” Zeller said. “The security force is no longer
represented by any union.”

According to Roberts, Security was not pressured to sever ties with
the UPGWA by the University. He said Zeller was “careful” in his
statements, and he did not interfere with the relationship between the
union and the officers.

“It took joining the union to get their attention,” Roberts said, but

“now we’re giving them a chance.” Roberts added he hoped the
University would “respond in good faith.”

In a written statement to the Bucknellian Monday Roberts said

“There are no plans—either now or in the forseeable future—for the

members of this department to affiliate themselves with another
union.”

Sands dies on 66th
day of hunger strike

Irish Republican Army hunger
striker Bobby Sands died Monday
in Belfast, Ireland, on the 66th
day of his politically motivated
hunger strike.

Sands, who was serving a 14-
year sentence in the Maze Prison
for a firearms violation, demand-
ed from the British government
that he and other Irish na-
tionalists jailed on terrorism
charges be granted political
status since they view them-
selves not as criminals but as
soldiers in a war of in-
dependence. He refused to eat un-
til such demands were met.

Although Irish Prime Minister
Charles Haughey appealed for
more flexible prison administra-
tion in Belfast, British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher in-
sisted that ‘there can be no com-
promise with murder and ter-
rorism.”

East-west relations

analysed by NATO

The North Atlantic Alliance an-
nounced a move to a harder view
of East-West relations Tuesday,
presenting an analysis that de-
emphasized detente and cast the
Soviet Union as a force increas-
ingly lacking in responsibility or
restraint.

The communique, made public
at the end of the NATO countries’
two-day conference of foreign
ministers in Rome, signaled at
least a preliminary verbal step
by the alliance in the direction
toward the Reagan Administra-
tion’s views on the Soviets.

But it also followed the
American announcement Mon-
day that the U.S. would be willing
to discuss certain limitations on
nuclear missiles in Europe with
the Soviet Union before the end of
the year.

NATIONAL

Social programs

slashed by House

The House of Reprsentatives
rejected two liberal budget alter-
natives for fiscal year 1982
Wednesday in lopsided votes that
illustrated dramatically the loss
of liberals’ power in Congress.

The votes, a prelude to the ex-
pected adoption sometime today
of the $689 billion budget en-

followed two days of debate in
which the liberals pleaded for the
restoration of programs they con-
sidered vital to the poor.

Meanwhile, the Senate Finance
Committee also took a knife to
budget fat, approving legislation
Tuesday that would cut $10.3
billion from a wide range of
social programs including
welfare, Medicaid and unemploy-
ment compensation.

Information Act to
go under review

Attorney General William
French Smith announced a major
change Monday in the way
Federal agencies respond to
public requests for Government
information and files—a change
which could restrict the
availability of such information.

In an announcement that the
Reagan Administration has
begun a formal review of the
Freedom of Information Act,
Smith said the change rescinds
the requirements—established
by then-Attorney General Griffin
Bell in 1977—that agencies wan-
ting to withhold requested in-
formation must prove such
disclosure would be ‘“demon-
strably harmful” to the govern-
ment.

Reporters Committee for
Freedom of the Press Director
Jack Lawdow said the new revi-
sion ‘will surely restrict the
public’s right to know govern-
ment information.”

LOCAL

Fraternity members
kidnap local mayor

The mayor of Lewisburg was
kidnapped last week by a group
of machine-gun toting,
sunglasses-wearing Lambda Chi
Alpha fraternity members who
demanded food from local
grocery stores as ransom.

But it was all a joke . . . sort of.

Led by former Bucknellian
Associate Editor David O’Con-
nell, the Lambda Chi’s nabbed
Mayor Lewis Hendricks from in
front of his Market Street office
Friday evening as a publicity
stunt to promote their effort to
get local residents to deposit food
parcels in stores which would
then be donated to the
Ministerium of Lewisburg.

The mayor was released short-
ly after the kidnap attempt
“because he said he had to get
home for dinner,” O’Connell said,
but the mayor’s kidnap ransom
fund’ drive continued all this
week.

Lewisburg resident

killed in collision

Lula Wise, 57, of RD2
Lewisburg, was killed Sunday
when her son’s car collided with
another auto at 2:45 a.m. on Buf-
falo Road, approximately 1'2
miles from Mifflinburg. Union
County Coroner James Schwartz,
Mifflinburg, pronounced her
dead of a broken neck and multi-
ple internal injuries at the scene
of the accident.

State police at Milton said the
car—driven by Mrs. Wise’s son,
Thomas, of 118 Market St.,
Mifflinburg—was travelling at an
apparent high speed when it
collided with an auto driven by
Kathleen Radel, 27, of Penns
Creek. The Wises were thrown
about 50 feet from the vehicle
after it left the roadway and went
into a wheat field, striking an em-
bankment.

Susquehanna bridge

undergoing repairs

The Lewisburg River Bridge is
once again undergoing repairs.

Additional work on the steel
frame of the bridge—which spans
the Susquehanna River from the
eastern end of Market Street into
West Chillisquaque Township—
began Monday, and will continue
from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. weekdays
for the next three or four weeks,
according to a State Department
of Transportation spokesman.

Periodic delays to motorists
are expected, he said, and Mon-
day was the first day the bridge
was open to only one lane of traf-
fic at a time.

The river bridge was closed for
deck repairs from July 14 to Sept.
12 last year.

EDITORIALS
Under the hood

Four weeks ago the message was “freedom of choice and equal
rights for all.”’ ah

This week the message is ‘segregation, guerilla training,
weapons and race war.”’ Clearly there is a contradiction.

While it may be true that the Klan’s membership is leaping for-
ward, it cannot be mistaken that the basic tenet of hate — hate
strong enough to incite a race war—is what the Klan is all about. It
is sad this hate has been made palatable by new slogans and
rhetoric. It is even sadder that many feel disillusioned enough in our
society that such an organization becomes an attractive alternative -

Instead of taking this tack, we must remember that our justice
system, no matter how seemingly ineffective at times, is what holds
us together as a society. Rather than abandoning it and establishing
individual vigilante control, we must revitalize it if there is to be
stability and order.

The rise and fall of the Klan has occurred many times before.
While we cannot deny its renewed vigor, we can only hope this is a
fickle flirtation. For if we are to have a potential of hope for the
future, we must first learn to live together in the present.

Timeworn scenario

You wouldn’t expect to see that timeworn scenario of the
prehistoric caveman, club in hand, dragging a woman behind him
by her hair.

That’s a clear-cut case of sexual harassment which shouldn’t
happen anymore because we’re civilized — we’re even college
students — and we know that type of thing is intolerable.

But it does. And it happens here. Campus Security reports docu-
ment at least 15 incidents of sexual harassment here this year.
Surveys show that only one out of ten incidents is reported.

The University took a positive step when it hired Donna Digin to
complement a previously all-male security force. Digin’s training
in dealing with cases of sexual harassment provides some
reassurance, but we would like to see increased action on the part of
the counseling service, Student Relations in Sexuality, and the Of-
fice of Student Affairs.

The key word on the subject of sexual harassment is awareness,
and that’s why we ran our story on this subject on the front page. In-
cidents should be reported to the administration and action must
promptly be taken, so we can all be protected.

Editor’s Note

Dear Bucknell:

The last story has just cleared my red pen and been sent
upstairs to the composing room, and I’m sitting here at one of those
old Royal typewriters, basking in the central Pennsylvania sunshine
that glints through the window above. The great two-ton rolls of
newsprint that will be chopped up into little, reader-sized pieces are
being clamped into the giant and humming presses. I am almost
finished for the day—and forever.

As I sit here, I’m finding it harder and harder to believe it will all
be over in a few minutes. I’ll have made the trip along the Sus-
quehanna from Milton to the UC in the big black Wattsmobile to
deliver those 46 bundles of paper and I’ll sit in the Bison and drink a
Tab and look at the faces of those looking at what I’ve brought them.
And then they’ll get up and they’ll bus their table and trash the paper
and I still won’t wonder for a minute whether or not it’s all been
worth it.

You see, editing and publishing a weekly newspaper worthy of
this University has been a goal of mine — and yes, a dream — since I
first arrived in Lewisburg five semesters ago. And I think I’ve done
that; the Bucknellian is now a newspaper as good as Bucknell —
strong in some areas, a lot weaker in others, vastly improved here,
still needing work there. But always respectable, responsible and
thorough.

All the newsprint stains and failed courses and strained friend-
ships have been worth that to me. Thanks,

“act

LETTERS

This is straight from a 5ig’s mouth

To the Editor:

The Bucknellian has once again
failed to follow up on something it
started. Also, the newspaper
likes to try and stir controversy
instead of covering the events
that take place here at Bucknell.

Since the Bucknellian has not
come to me or to Sigma Chi about
Sig Derby, I will offer the en-
couraging information of a most
successful event. First off, I feel
everyone should know that no

less than $1,000 will be sent to
Sigma Chi’s national service pro-
ject, Wallace Village, a facility
that treats youths afflicted with
minimal brain dysfunction.

This year funds were raised
through our Sig Derby Program,
a raffle, the legs pictures and the
drink-a-thon. We at Sigma Chi
would like to thank our alumni for
their donations, and also the
faculty member who made a
donation.

Nice guys aren't so bad

To the Editor:

Item: The marching bands of Yale and Harvard have half-time
shows depicting muggings and sexual innuendo, while the marchers

wear diapers.

Item: Students in schools like the University of Michigan and
University of Pennsylvania engage in a game called KAOS: Killer As
Organized Sport, where they run around campus staging mock
assassinations; the person with the most victims wins.

Is this the modern college experience? Somehow I don’t feel so bad
about going to a school where the main fault of the student body is that

it’s nice.

Jim Snedeker ’81

In reflecting back on Derby
Days ’81, I feel proud to say that
all ran fairly smoothly in the end,
and that most everyone enjoyed
the festivities. The results of Sig
Derby saw Coach Joe Claffey
lead Kappa Kappa Gamma
sorority to victory while Coach

that should be discussed

Tim Christie’s inspiration ena-
bled Alpha Chi Omega sorority to
earn the Spirit Award. It was a
tough competition right down to
the wire, and for that I’d like to
thank all the coaches and the
sororities for a job well done.
Special thanks also goes to all
those who helped me to make Sig
Derby a success and a most
memorable time for me.

To the Bucknellian, thanks for
allowing me to report on Derby
Days 81, and I hope next year the
school newspaper spends a little
more time reporting on the
events of this campus.

A private’ public issue

To the Editor:

It is still possible radioactive tritium and carbon-14 may be in-
cincerated at Bucknell’s power plant. Jack Harclerode’s letter to
the administration suggests, ‘‘The only possibility that comes to
mind is that perhaps incineration could be done at Bucknell’s
power plant. I would like to request that this avenue be explored by
the Physical Plant and that in the future we dispose of radioactive
wastes in this fashion if at all possible.”

I feel this is a public issue, and, I asked Harclerode, John Zeller,
Wendell Smith, and six others to ‘‘have an open panel discussion to
inform this community about radioactive wastes that will be
created and disposed of here, and how they might affect our en-
vironment and health.”’

Two weeks later, I had gotten no response. After asking again, I
finally got an uninformative note from Wendell Smith saying ‘“‘an
ad hoc committee of science and engineering faculty will be asked
to review NRC’s data.”

Why are there only science and engineering faculty on this com-
mittee? Ask other community members whose lives are affected.
For example, Dave Mann of the Susquehanna Valley Alliance in
Lewisburg has studied nuclear power and radioactive wastes and
has said, “‘I’ll be glad to help if I can.”

Our questions concerning the use of radioactive waste and its ef-
fect on our health and environment are still unanswered. Our ad-
ministration should inform us about radioactive wastes on campus.
Why is the decision on this campus issue left in the hands of a few?

The groups are the same, but meaning is missing

By Tom Madigan

While strolling down a dark, lonely
street late one night, I heard a voice call to
me from one of the garbage-filled
alleyways, “Hey, got a minute?” I
curiously replied, ‘‘Sure,”’ and out of the
darkness of the alley stepped a rather
disheveled man in his early thirties.

“Who are you?” I asked. ‘‘I used to be a
folk singer, but nobody wants to listen to
that kind of music anymore,” was his re-
ply.

A folk singer, I thought to myself.
Another one of those lost flower children of
the ’60s. You never know, though, this
might be ‘‘Candid Camera” or something.
I confidentially asked him to explain, all
the time making sure to keep my best side
facing the camera that might have been
hidden in the trash can.

“It’s rather complicated,”’ he replied. ‘‘I
was big at one time. We had the kids ques-
tioning everything—the war, poverty, the
government, the whole works. But that
was a long time ago, when the people buy-
ing the albums really cared about what the
music was trying to say. Jefferson
Airplane, Tom Rush, Donovan, The
Byrds—there was always a message in
their music, not like this garbage they’re
selling today.”

“Wait a minute,” I interrupted. “You
can’t talk about my music like that. If this
music you're talking about is so hot, how
come I never hear it on the radio?”

He let out a sigh and rolled his eyes.
“You're just like all the rest—you don’t
understand at all. Back then music had a
purpose other than pure and simple enter-
tainment. Musicians wrote about political
and social issues. Songs had a message...”

“OK,” I shouted, ‘‘but what about musi-
cians like Bob Dylan and the Rolling
Stones? They were big then and they’re
still popular now. And what about Jeffer-
son Airplane? They changed their name
but they’re still recording. What about
that, you hippie freak!”

“Their music has changed,” he replied.
“Dylan sings about God now. Jefferson
Airplane used to write songs about a
revolution, now they write songs about
miracles.” .

“So the music’s changed. But that’s nor-
mal. The stuff you’re talking about was a
big change from the music of the 50s,” I
stammered.

“Exactly. The music is a reflection of
the public’s values and concerns. Today’s
music is a regression to the ‘Richie Cun-
ningham’ stuff of the ’50s. It’s an
anesthetic, just like television. It all
diverts the public’s attention away from
what’s really going on in the world.

“Sure, the dosage used today is stronger
than that of the fifties—sex and violence
instead of high school romances and
cars—but it has to be; there’s a lot more to
divert attention away from today. People
don’t want to know what’s going on, so they
absorb themselves in things totally re-
moved from the ‘real world,’ like new

wave music. You know, leave the prob-
lems for somebody else to handle.”

“But what about punk rock?” I replied
meagerly. All those musicians sound real
angry and dress so weird and everything.”

“Well I’ve got to admit, I thought punk
was the real thing for awhile there. But,
the bands that really had something to say
were all from Europe, and they never real-
ly picked up a following here.”

“That’s true, and disco is so regimented
and style oriented...I mean...” But it was
too late. The musician—sensing a possible
recruit, exclaimed “Right! Right! You’re
starting to understand. No time to worry

about real life problems—You’ve got to get
the choreography straight...”

This was too much. What would my
friends think? What if that really is a
camera over there? ‘‘Look pal, I agree
with some of the things you’re saying,
but....um, like, I’ve kind of got to get going,
you know? Can I lend you some money ?”

A dejected expression replaced his
smile. ‘“‘That’s OK,’ he said, and slunk
back into the darkness of the alley.

Albert Einstein, the man who did as
much as anyone to help us understand the
world in which we live, once said, ‘‘The
most incomprehensible thing about the
world is that it is comprehensible.” This is
not to say that any one person can sum up
the human condition at this particular
time in history. And it would be wise to
cast a wary eye on those who claim they

PHILLING
IN

—————EEEE,

Nevertheless, I think it is important col-
lege students attempt to fathom our
human condition, both because one
thereby achieves a better understanding of
oneself and because leaders of American
society should have reflected on such
things before attaining leadership posi-
tions.

That said, I offer the following observa-
tions for your consideration.

Critical thinking is on the wane. Half the

OPINIONS
Phil’s final offering: words of wisdom and warning

world’s population lives under totalitarian
rule, with no decrease in sight. Alfred
North Whitehead noted, ‘‘Civilization ad-
vances by extending the number of impor-
tant operations which we can perform
without thinking.”

Is it not true most Americans will do
almost anything to avoid being alone with
their thoughts? If an American is alone in
a car, it is a safe bet a radio or tape player
will be on. By itself, this is not significant.
But it seems to be reflective of a larger and
worrisome trend.

I’ve also wondered whether the U.S.
could survive as we know it without televi-
sion. Assuming the average American
watches two to three hours a day, it takes
but two days for the nation to spend a
billion hours in front of the set. Imagine
what we could be doing instead.

We live in an increasingly intercon-
nected world. Robert Penn Warren
describes this beautifully in All the King’s
Men when he says “‘the world is like an
enormous spider web and if you touch it,
however lightly, at any point, the vibration
ripples to the remotest perimeter.”

In very practical terms, a corporate
boardroom decision in the U.S. may have
severe economic repercussions for the
citizens of another country. It is crucial
that those in powerful positions realize as
Jack Burden eventually did in All the

King’s Men that there is no escaping
responsibility for their actions.

To improve the chance that people grasp
the direct and indirect effects of their ac-
tions, colleges should emphasize an inter-
disciplinary and holistic approach to
education. It is folly to separate knowledge
to the extent we do. Consider the problem
of scientific literacy among nonscientists
and the implications that has for public
policy.

Nationalism is on the rise. We live at or
near the peak of the sovereign state era. It
is the state that commands the first loyalty
of most people in the world today. Kenneth
Boulding has said, ‘‘the only religion that
still requires human sacrifice is na-
tionalism.”

Paradoxically, the state is increasingly
unable to control its domain. Multinational
corporations, exported inflation, acid rain
and refugee flows are just a few of the
many interstate agents of change that are
slowly eroding the sovereignty of the state.

How long the sovereign state will last is
unclear. What is clear is the imperative of
some form of world federalism to provide
for a nongeographical criterion for the
distribution of world resources.

Nationalism, when placed above love for
humanity, is idolatry. To whom or to what
is your first loyalty?

The need for “I-Thou,” rather than “I-

It” relationships is pressing. The terms
are those of Martin Buber, a Jewish
philosopher. His message was that it is
wrong to treat a human as an object in-
stead of as a person—a unique individual.

When people are relegated to the status
of things, they become less than human to
the people categorizing them. It then
becomes ‘‘acceptable” to treat them as
outlaws—as persons outside the protection
of the law.

Attitudes toward the enemy in wartime
provide the best example of the conse-
quences of treating persons as things. The
tendency of men on bombing missions to
disassociate their actions with the carnage
on the ground below is an illustration on an
“T-It”’ relationship.

Ominously, ‘‘I-It’’ appears even more
likely with nuclear weapons, because of
the tremendous separation between the
point of fire and the point of impact.

I have taken a stab at making sense of
the world. It is of course skeletal and im-
complete, but I hope it provokes thought
and interest in the subject.

I leave you with a quotation from Micah
6:8 that I find valuable as a guide for liv-
ing. The words may be found as well on the
back. of Rooke Chapel: ‘“‘What doth the
Lord require of thee but to do justice, to
love mercy and to walk humbly with thy
God.”

Bourgeois liberal gains perspective
& loses some liberal preconceptions

By Dan Huck

WASHINGTON—It was dubbed the “Progressive
Express” to the March on the Pentagon here, Sun-
day, but when my alarm blared and I awoke at 5:57
a.m. Sunday, I felt anything but progressive.

During my varying-heat shower (well-known
among Kress residents), I began to have second
thoughts about sharing my day with those
“bandana-bearing leftists” of the Bucknell Pro-
gressive Caucus. The march was foremost,
however, and so I sucked in my preconceptions and
headed for the University Center.

My back and legs immediately started aching
when I saw a school bus instead of the Greyhound
Ameri-Cruiser I had been sure would be waiting.
But I stepped aboard, grabbed a front seat and
waited. The others came in a quiet hum — half pro-
fessors, half students — with banners, signs and
backpacks. As the bus filled, someone asked, “Does
so-and-so have the machete?”’; no one laughed.
refused to be paranoid and tried not to think about
the paper due the next day.

The Pennsylvania countryside soon began rolling
by and I scrunched up with a Congressional Report
on CIA activities in Chile. I though it was more ap-
propriate than Geology. My end of the bus was quite
awake, and we talked and laughed about everything
from politics to the Celtics-Sixers’ basketball game.
Everyone was willing to share the conversation, but
my prejudices crept back and let me hide. The food
was also shared liberally; oranges, breadsticks,
celery, candy and other tupperware-contained
goodies circulated freely. But I waited until Get-
tysburg, where I wolfed down a bourgeoise Big Mac
and fries.

All of a sudden the bus was in Georgetown, then
downtown Washington, then the Lincoln Memorial.
After pulling up to the curb, the first salutation was
from a policeman who told the driver, “Tf you’re not
out of here in five minutes, it’ll cost you 50 bucks.”
Not wanting to anger anyone in blue that day, I
quickly beat some circulation back into my legs and
got out.

That wasn’t the only one of Washington’s finest
“attending,” though. They were there on foot, they
were there in riot gear, they were on top of the Lin-
coln Memorial, they were on motorcycles, on
mopedes and on horses. And they were in a
helicopter that periodically buzzed the crowd, until

a chorus of up-raised middle fingers began to
discourage them.

A softball field near the State Department was the
“pre-rally” point. Button and bumper-stickers
salesmen had a field day while speakers launched
emotional verbiage on everything from El Salvador
to the Palestine Liberation Organization. Those who
could sit through the socialist bombardment might
even have heard some salient points made.

The marchers were then asked to assemble, anda
band of 14-year-olds played anti-government disco
to set the pace. A group psychologist must have
planned the beginning stages of the march, because
thousands of the people were moving the length of a
football field in the space of 100 feet. Eventually we
“hit the street” and made a one-block loop past the
State Department. I didn’t realize until later that
the chants and banners were directed at an empty

building. (Sunday, you know.)

As the procession crossed the Arlington Memorial
Bridge, I began to notice not just socialists, com-
munists and “progressive ’ marchers, but also
mothers, teachers and businessmen. The crowd was
not just radical white kids from college, but also
contained the liberals and moderates who had sat at
home years ago and watched Vietnam on the six-
o’clock news.

The chants (‘‘No draft, no war, United States out
of El Salvador’’) didn’t last long in this procession.
One hundred thousand people were there to make a
statement just by their presence. Others—like Jef-
fry Walker and his professional and interesting
“Theatre Preserve’’—made more obvious
statements at the Pentagon.

Speeches at the “post-rally” continued on in emo-
tional repetition, and the time came to head back to
Bucknell. We all shared some laughs and some
beers, and this time, I even ate my middle-class
meal with some of the BPC members, when we
stopped in Gettysburg.

The trip Sunday helped me make a personal state-
ment on El Salvador that no other method could
have satisfied. Certainly it was not enough, but
perhaps we members of the 100,000 have in some
way sparked yours and this country’s conscience.
And to the BPC marchers I'd like to say thanks.
You’ve given this bourgeoise liberal a better
perspective and a few less preconceptions.

David Crosby’s concert here is lacking

Buskin and Batteau well-received by audience

By JEFF CROSS

To the dismay of many in the
audience at Tuesday’s David
Crosby concert, the Bucknell
Concert Committee’s second
presentation of a solo performer
in the intimate confines of
Coleman Theatre this semester
proved less of an artistic success
than its predecessor.

While the Feb. 28 David
Bromberg concert was generally
acclaimed, Crosby gave an
uninspired performance in a pair
of shows.

Whether it was caused by the
mellow midweek atmosphere in
the audience or the crowd’s long-
ing for a return to the customary
stand-up-and-shout concerts in
Davis Gymnasium, Crosby’s
desultory effort left the audience
wondering why they had paid $6
apiece to see a member of one of
rock and roll’s legendary groups.

While some in attendance ap-
pealed for a solo rendition of
Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young’s
stinging protest tune, ‘“Ohio,”
they had to settle for an evening
of quiet acoustic guitar work.

By contract, the talented
warmup of David Buskin and
Robin Batteau gave a thoroughly
enjoyable performance that over-
shadowed all but Crosby’s closing
numbers, when his melodious
guitar work was nicely com-
plemented bv the appearance of
Carl Schwindeman on electric
guitar.

Crosby’s soulful vocals and
spirited playing on his final two
pieces, “Drive My Car” and
“Wooden Ships,” and the encore
“Long Time Gone” were easily
the highlights of the evening,
drawing boisterous applause.

Although the crowd sat silent
throughout most of the early go-
ing of the 70-minute appearance,

including two nondescript
unreleased songs, ‘‘Distances’’
and “Delta,” the old favorite
“Guinnevere”’ was more popular-
ly received.

Buskin and Batteau gave a
more lively show by delivering
fast, lighthearted songs that kept
the audience amused.

After a hilarious dialogue con-
trasting life in Buskin’s native
New York City and Batteau’s
hometown of Cambridge, Mass.,
the pair sang their first mellow
song, ‘“‘Cambridge Blues.”

Buskin and Batteau’s finest
work was their final effort, “The
Boy With The Violin” that.
showcased Batteau’s talents on
the violin and mandolin with
Buskin’s accompaniment on the
piano.

Too bad the headline per-

final three songs, could not main-

By DAVID HAWKINGS

Contrary to popular belief, no theater
critic — be he one for a college paper or a
major metropolitan daily — likes to not
like the plays he reviews. There’s really no
fun in thinking of new ways to be critical;
the fun comes instead from thinking of new
ways to look at and appreciate drama.

So it is with a sense of dutiful regret that
I sat to write about The Rivals, the last of
five of this year’s offerings by Cap and
Dagger and, unfortunately, by far the
worst. While the other productions
mounted on the Coleman Theatre stage in
the past nine months have ranged in our
eyes from mediocre to almost outstanding,
The Rivals under the direction of Adjunct
Assistant Professor of English and
Theatre James Symmons qualifies as an
almost unqualified disaster.

The problems with the play — which
played two nights last weekend and will be
offered again tonight and Saturday at 8:30
p.m. — really began a year ago. When Cap

and Dagger members approved Symmons
proposal to do The Rivals, they and the
director should have realized that by selec-
ting R. B. Sheridan’s late 18th century
period comedy of manners and mistaken
identity, they would risk giving the im-
pression of simply doing a rerun of
Molieres’s Tartuffe, performed in Oc-
tober.

And however superficial an analysis that
might have seemed at the time, that is ex-
actly what happened this spring.

The Rivals is a strange and unfortunate
deja vu. Again occupying the title role,
Barry Fishel ’81 portrays Captain Jack
Absolute, an army officer who has come to
Bath, England and is overcome with at-
traction for sophomore Amy Beth Cohn’s
Lydia Languish.

It seems as if only the names have been
changed to protect the guilty: the
character Fishel puts into the military
regalia is too much like the one he put into
religious vestments in the fall, and neither
he nor Cohn — who once-again plays a coy,
sought-after young brat — have improved
on the formulas they concocted before.

And this seems to hold true for two other
experienced Bucknell actors cast in the
play. As Bob Acres, Jawwaad Abdul-Aziz
82 only intensifies the flustered bumbling
he gave us in A Funny Thing Happened on
the Way to the Forum. Junior David
Blackman’s Faulkland also shows vividly

_how tired he must be of constantly playing

the jilted young lover.

tain the same level of intensity.

Photos—Charlie Berul
David Crosby (above) performs at the first of his two shows
Tuesday night in Coleman Theater before an estimated 700
fans. At left, Carl Schwindeman joins Crosby for the final
three songs of the 13-song performance, playing electric
guitar to complement Crosby on acoustic guitar. The concert
was the second presented by the Bucknell Concert Committee
in the intimate surroundings of Coleman this semester.

es season with ‘The Rivals’

A few sparks of humor and a welcome resolved next year by attempting only four
glint of good acting are brought on by the shows. But in this case, the extra time
performances of a few well-known names‘. might not have been spent wisely — this
in Cap and Dagger. As the father to cast and production seemed lost in itself
Fishel’s Captain Absolute, junior Stu Gay from the start.
brings a bombastic sprightliness to the
role of Sir Anthony, and the scenes he
plays with Fishel are the best The Rivals
has to offer. And, despite her often jerky
mannerisms, Lynne Rutherford ’82 por-
trays the syntactically outrageous Mrs.

Malaprop quite adequately. Junior Will
Walters is also commendable as the brash
Sir Lucius O’ Trigger.

Unfortunately, though, these few
brighter spots in the cast are overshadow-
ed in number and incompetence by the
supporting players, a collection of
newcomers who — with the possible excep-
tion of Gabrielle Dorland ’83 — bring F
nothing but drudgery and doom to the pro-
duction.

‘The production’s biggest problem,
though, comes from the directing. Many
find the work of a playwright of Sheridan’s
era stilting to the ear — but blocked and ~ 4
paced to last more than two and a half ;
hours, it becomes more than stifling to the oe
rear. More trimming of the fat from what
seemed to be a padded plot would have ~
gone a long way toward lightening up an
evening made dreary by its length. :

Finally, Symmons suffered as Allen : ;

Haines had in his direction of Our Town in Lynne Rutherford ‘82 rehearses the
February. Neither had enough time, apro- role of Mrs Malaprop for Cap and

the Fitzwilliam String Quartet
during their residency here last
fall will be aired on WITF-FM at
4p.m. May 17 and May 24.

The quartet’s members —
Christopher Rowland, Jonathan
Sparey, Alan George and Ioan
Davies — studied together at
Cambridge University in
England, where they formed the
group in 1974, and their visit to
the United States in 1978 initiated
a series of appearances at
various locations throughout the
country. Among their recent ap-
pearances was a performance at
Carnegie Recital Hall in New
York in October.

The quartet has exposed
American music lovers to the
music of Shostakovich in a flavor
and style which is uniquely its
own, and has been acclaimed by
music critics as the foremost in-
terpreter of that composer.

The quartet will return to the
University this fall and during
the 1982-83 academic year.

Arts festival to end
with kites in flight

The Lewisburg Festival of the
Arts will end with a Kite Festival
at noon Sunday at the St. An-
thony’s Street Little League field.

The main idea of the festival is
to have a community kite fly-in
with the town invited to gather
and fly kites, according. to kite
festival Chairman David Remer
of Lewisburg.

A $3 registration fee will be
charged for competitors, and
prizes will be awarded in five

flies first and the kite that flies
the longest. There will also be
awards for the biggest, smallest
and best-looking kites.

Remer said he hopes the
weather will permit a demonstra-
tion of “fighter kites—small,
angular kites with an historical
tradition in Japan and India.
Remer has designed and built
fighter kites which he says re-
quire a light wind to stay aloft.

Abstract oil paintings exhibit
to be shown in Center Gallery

The opening of an exhibit of Premiere Paintings by Pamela
Souders Feir will be held from 6 to 8 p.m. Thursday in the Universi-
ty Center Gallery.

A Lewisburg resident, Feir is a graduate student in painting
here. She received her bachelor’s degree from Muhlenberg College
in Allentown.

Feir’s large abstract oil paintings use color to create light. Using
color to manipulate architectural forms and geometric structures,
she produces an immediate sensory confrontation with the viewer.

The artist brushes color on the rough canvas and linen surfaces in
successive applications, working over a period of several months
on each painting. ‘‘The successive applications of color are an im-
portant aspect of the paintings,” Feir said. “The light must come
from within the painting as well as from the immediate color sen-
sation.”

The size and scale of the paintings help the viewer to experience
the color in both ways. Feir’s works are “Jifesize”’ or slightly
larger, with dimensions ranging from 4 by 5 feet to 5 by 7 feet.
Because the paintings are people-scaled, they invite a general,
overall ‘first impression’ and a more intimate examination of the
surface texture and its light.

One of Feir’s oil paintings was shown at the William Penn
Museum in Harrisburg in January as part of the “‘Women in the
Arts Celebration ’81”” Exhibit. She has also exhibited her water-
color and acrylic paintings in a number of regional shows since
1977.

The exhibit will continue through June 15. The gallery is open
from 12:30- 4:30 p.m. weekdays.

‘Stir Crazy,’ an entertaining comedy,
portrays a ‘great escape’ prison saga

By DANNY CRAVEN

“Stir Crazy’’, a somewhat entertaining comedy
from Columbia Pictures directed by Sidney Poitier,
portrays two framed convicts in a spoof of the ar-
chetypal ‘‘Great Escape’’ prison saga.

The film presents Gene Wilder as Skip Donahue,
an unpublished New York playwright who possesses
the reassuring, humanitarian romanticism that
Wilder so aptly demonstrated in his previous role as
Willie Wonka in the ‘‘Willie Wonka and the
Chocolate Factory.’ (1971) Also starring is pre-
free-base Richard Pryor as Harry Monroe, an
unemployed actor who—unlike his friend
Donahue—has adopted a. realistic and somewhat
caustic attitude towards life.

Frustrated, Monroe and Donahue meet in a
Manhattan bar and decide to head west to
Hollywood for fame and glory. Short of cash, they
stop in a redneck south-western town to earn money
by dressing as woodpeckers and dancing in a pro-
motional skit for a local bank. During a lunch break,
their ridiculous costumes become the disguises of
bank robbers and the innocent Donahue and Monroe
are sentenced to 125 years in prison.

It is here that they plan an escape.

Under Poitier’s deft direction of a screenplay by
Bruce Jay Friedman, it’s the teamwork that counts.
There is, for example, the glorious moment when
Pryor tries to teach his pal how to behave in a stir—
by “walking bad,” ‘“‘talking bad,” and ‘looking
baaaaaaaaad as they come.”

Academy Award winning actor-turned-director
Poitier is a ‘‘stickler for detail,’ according to
Wilder. As such, most of the movie was filmed on
location at the Arizona State Penitentiary using the
inmates as extras. The concept of realism in com-
edy is a hard technique to execute, but Poitier does
it with ease.

“When you lift a rock under Sidney’s direction,
you lift a real rock — not a balsa wood phony. When
you dig a ditch, the earth better move for you baby.
In one scene, I’m confined to a torture chamber
called ‘the box’, a sealed metal compartment 3 feet
by 5 feet, as punishment,” Wilder explains.

“Tt was 95 degrees outside and hot enough in the
‘box’ to cook a steak. I came out dripping perspira-
tion with my legs wobbling. Sidney was delighted.
“You're really acting,’ he said. ‘Who’s acting?’ I
asked.”’

The contrast between realism and romanticism
that Pryor and Wilder provide is entertaining. They
have established a unique rapport with each other
that is also evident in an earlier film ‘Silver
Streak”’ in which they co-starred.

“Stir Crazy” is not great, although it has grossed
more than $100 million at the box office. However, it
is a funny film, good for a lot of chuckles, a few
hearty belly-laughs and an hour and a half of enter-
tainment.

Shows begin tonight a 7 and 9 p.m. at the Campus
Theatre. The film, rated “‘R’’, also stars Georg
Stanford Brown, Jobeth Williams and Lee Purcell.

Gene Wilder. and Richard Pryor break into feathered show biz
as two innocent jailbirds who figure out a hilarious way to fly
the coop in "Stir Crazy” a Columbia Pictures Release opening
tonight at the Campus Theatre. Sidney Poitier directed the
outrageous tale from a screenplay by Bruce Jay Friedman.
The film was produced by Hannah Weinstein and Melville
Tucker was executive producer.

with apair of defeats

Men’s lacrosse finishes at 3-10

Penn State and Delaware both inflict

losses in pair of high scoring games

By KEN QUAAS

“We couldn’t put the ball in the goal when it counted, and that’s

- J

been the story of our season,” said Senior Tri-Captain Stu Berger about
the last lacrosse game of his collegiate career, a 15-6 loss to Penn State

Wednesday.

State College was the scene of the culmination of a disappointing 3-
10 season for the Bucknell laxmen as a straining schedule and a lacking

offense once again proved their undoing.

But as Coach Sid Jamieson said, the Bisons did not “‘roll over and
play dead.” The laxmen outshot Penn State — which seems to build top-
caliber intercollegiate athletic teams overnight — 5-6, 4-2, and controll-

ed the game in terms of possession time.
Senior Tri-Captain Jim Gilbert agreed with Berger:

“We just

couldn’t seem to score,” he said. Perhaps this is best demonstrated by
the fact that the Bisons were trailing 2-0 after the first quarter despite
taking 15 shots. ‘“We were taking stupid shots,” explained Berger, “and

we weren’t playing like a smart lacrosse team.”’

Defensively, the laxmen managed to contain an explosive Penn State

attack, and kept the game within reach, 6-3, at the half. But as has

hap-

pened again and again all season, Bucknell looked sluggish at the start
of the third period and the team was immediately swamped by four
unanswered goals from which it never recovered. The Bisons began the
fourth quarter down by seven, 11-4, and were outscored 4-2 in the final

period by the Lions, ranked 11th in last week’s Division I top 15.

The biggest disappointment of the season, however, came Saturday

when the laxmen travelled to Newark to

Hens stunned the Bisons early by jumping to a 6-1 lead.

tributed three goals between them to spark the attack.

Gilbert, also in his last regular season outing, called the match “our
best team effort,” his comment exemplified by a Bison surge which saw
Delaware outscored 11-9 during the last three quarters of the match.

Although Berger termed the loss “the biggest disappointment of my
“T was proud of the team and the way we
came back. We played as a team the last two games of the season and

lacrosse career,” he said,

there was a marked improvement.”

Defenseman Gilbert agreed with his goalie and said ‘‘It was a tough
one to lose — we hate to lose to Delaware.” Neither Berger nor Gilbert
saw Bucknell beat Delaware during their collegiate careers, the Hens
having edged the Bisons in each of the last three seasons by one goal.

Junior Tri-Captain John Morris led the assault on Delaware by not-
ching four goals, as sophomore Rink Smith — who tallied a game-high
four against Penn State — contributed three, and Rob Mathai "82 and

Mathieson fired in two apiece.

Softball tops Lehigh 11-5,
edges Susquehanna, 2-1

By S. J. FURMAN

Just as the Bucknell Women’s Softball
Team was beginning to play well together
— exemplified by a 2-1 victory over Sus-
quehanna Tuesday — the season abruptly
ended, leaving the Bisons with a record of
7-11.

Action began in the fourth when the
Crusaders scored their only run. The
Bisons responded quickly and made it 1-1
as junior Stephanie Buck led off the bottom
of the inning with a single, senior Patty In-
chalik singled, and a Crusader error enabl-
ed the runners to advance to second and
third. Alison Brown ’82 walked, loading the
bases.

Two outs later, with the Susquehanna in-
field back, Kay Swartz 82 successfully
punted Buck home. The Bisons scored
again the fifth with a walk, a single and
two sacrifices to make the final score 2-1.

i The Bisons played host to Lehigh Satur-
ag by the Lehigh gay, crushing them 11-5. The Engineers
on the West Field travelled to Lewisburg sporting a 5-7
record, but Bucknell was not friendly host.

As Buck went three-for-three with one
RBI, freshman Cynthia Connelly (5-7)
went all the way on the mound for the
Bisons against Susquehanna Tuesday,
holding Susquehanna to just two hits.
Bucknell managed only four hits — but
they were timely.

Two devastating defeats came when
Bucknell faced York College in a twinbill
April 25. The first game was a heartbreak-
ing 10-9 loss — with only two of York’s 10
runs earned as the Bisons let seven errors
slip by.

In the second game, Connelly lost her
usual control and allowed seven runs and
five walks by the second inning, and York
again dropped the Bisons, 9-3.

Bucknell continued down the rocky path
for a while, especially when Ithaca College
arrived with their powerhouse for another
doubleheader April 27.

Much to everyone’s surprise, Connelly
chalked up the win for the first game as
the Bisons defeated Ithaca 3-2 in extra in-
nings. The second game went to Ithaca 8-6.

Golfers take eighth in Districts

Bisons trail Temple by 77 with 54-hole score of 970

By JACK SNYDER

“We are through!” a relieved Coach Jeff Ranck
said after the golf team wrapped up its season Mon-
day and Tuesday with an eighth place finish in the
NCAA District II Golf Tournament.

Ten schools competed in the two-day tournament
to qualify for the Nationals at the renowned Hog’s
Neck Country Club in Easton, Md., and the course
proved to be a tough challenge for the Bisons as they
struggled over the 7,100 yard shot-demanding track.

Champion Temple showed no sign of fatigue as it
ran away with the 54-hole tournament with a com-
bined team score of 893. The runnerup team, Penn
State, was an astounding 50 strokes behind them, as
Lehigh followed with a 947.

Bucknell finished nestled in a tight crowd of seven
schools, all within nine strokes of each other, to
finish eighth at 970, edging Rutgers and Colgate
which shot 971 and 972, respectively.

Bill Francis ’83 was low medalist for the Bisons,
turning in a 54-hole round of 239, followed by Senior
Captain Rob Wagner ’81 and Peter Orr ’84 both at
244. Mike Stoyla ’82 and Kevin High ’81 finished at
246 and 255.

Although the team did not qualify for the Na-
tionals, Ranck said that Wagner stands an “‘outside
chance” of qualifying individually for the Nationals
based on his “good consistent play through the
year, with the exception of the districts.”

Wagner must first be notified by an NCAA com-
mittee, which will determine his eligibility for the
national tourney to be held at Stanford May 27-30.

In the East Coast Conference Championship, held
April 27-28 at the Brentwood Golf Club in Elkton
Md., the team finished a disappointing sixth, with a
36-hole stroke total of 777.

Wagner placed sixth individually with a 148 and
Orr took 16th with a 152. Other leading Bucknell
scorers were Stoyla with 158 and High at 160.

The golfers had a relatively poor season this year
due to a “lack of interest and dedication” on the
team’s part, which resulted in inconsistent play, ac-
cording to Ranck. The team had such shallow depth
that at some matches Coach Ranck recalled “‘the
biggest question we were faced with was who
wanted to play.”

Despite the coach’s dissatisfaction, however, the
golfers finished with a winning 5-4 record.

Baseball drops a home
twinbill to Bloomsburg

By ROBERT BURNEY

Back in the optimistic early days of the season, Coach Tommy
Thompson confided that one of the biggest obstacles facing his
baseball team was putting all aspects of its game together at one
time.

Never did that necessity become more apparent than during
Monday’s twinbill with Bloomsburg, in which the Bisons put ona
show Lou Brock would have enjoyed—stealing 19 bases in 20
attempts—but still managing to drop both games. “Our pitching
really hurt us,” lamented Thompson.

Freshman Mark Glatz pitched three strong innings in the opener
before being touched up for five runs in the fourth, the big blow be-
ing a three-run homer by Jack LaCesa.

A pair of errors by Carl Nablo ’82 in the sixth paved the way for
four more unearned runs off Jim Smith ’84 effectively sealing the
game for the Huskies.

The Bisons’ turns at bat were far from mundane, however, as
they stole bases off Bloomsburg catcher Jeff Koscelarsky. Ed
Hughes ’83 led the assault with four swipes, while George Kangos
81 and Paul Bamford ’83 had two each; and Jim Eick ’82, John Cor-
neil ’84, and Bill Lawrence ’81 and Jim Frantz ’83 grabbed one
apiece.

Not to discriminate, the Bisons went to work on new catcher An-
dy Marcantonio in the nightcap and stole eight more sacks.
Kangos, Bamford and Bick each grabbed a pair, while Lawrence
and Corneil made off with another each.

With four stolen bases on the day, Kangos set a new Bucknell
career record for steals, as his 27 eclipsed the mark of 26 set by
Dave Kasputis ’77.

Unfortunately, pitching again served as the Bisons’ own worst
enemy. Starter Tom Ganter ’81 had to be yanked after giving up
four runs in one-third of an inning.

Rich Bongiovanni ’82 gave up three in the second and two more in
the third, before giving way to Smith who surrendered only one run
over two innings. Ken Durr ’82 pitched the final two frames, allow-
ing a pair of unearned runs.

Bucknell pushed across two runs in the first, three in the third,
three in the fifth and one in the sixth off Ron Lockwood and Paul
Gibson. But nine runs weren’t enough, as the Huskies made it a
sweep, 12-9, and the Bison record fell to 6-8.

Lafayette Coach Norm Gigon got two complete-game victories
from his starters when the Leopards paid their spring visit to
Lewisburg Saturday. Scott Bailéy scattered 11 hits and four runs in
the opener for an 8-4 victory, while Hughes took the loss for
Bucknell.

Lafayette’s Ed Vore came within five outs of a no-hitter in the
nightcap, as Kangos’ single in the eighth was all the offense the
Bisons could muster. Durr pitched well for the batsmen, going the
distance in the 4-0 loss. ‘‘Durr has had some awfully tough luck this
year,” remarked Thompson, “‘for the season he had there’s no way

he should be 2-6.””

Women ruggers hobbled

by Ist seaso

By DAVID HAWKINGS

Despite a one-day wave of in-
juries and a steady loss of in-
terest as the spring season has
worn on, the women’s rugby
team has concluded its maiden
voyage.

It really wasn’t much of a first-
year season for the lady ruggers,
though. They opposed another
college only once, and were
smashed and shutout 12-0 by an
experienced Franklin & Marshall
squad April 22.

It was during that contest that
the novice rugby squad took its
worst beating, both in terms of
the score and the rash of twisted
ankles, separated collar bones
and battered limbs that plagued
the team all afternoon. Five
Bison women were treated for
such injuries during and after the
contest.

When asked about the torrent
of injuries, sophomore Captain
Patti Cullen cited the team’s in-
experience in ‘‘real’’ match play.
“We just didn’t know how to fall
properly or take getting tackles,”
Cullen said.

The afternoon in Lancaster was
not a total loss for the team,
however. The Bisons second-
string squad — with a little help
from a few F & M ruggers who
were recruited to round-out the
“B”’ team — scored a 6-4 victory
over the F & M reserves. Both
scores came from Bucknell
players, however, as Claire

Myers ’82 scored a two-point tie
and Cullen added a four-point
field goal.

-The only other formalized com-
petition this season was a 4-4 in-
trasquad match played last
week. A previously cancelled
match with Dickinson was
rescheduled for today, but was
called off by the Red Devils again
Thursday.

The season began auspiciously
enough for the team. The concept
of a women’s rugby squad first
appeared on campus in mid-
February, when senior Rugby
Club member Jeff McConnell and
Louise Bristol ’83 called an open
organizational meeting for a
possible team which 70 people at-
tended.

Encouraged, McConnell and
Bristol began a regimen of out-
door, often snowy practices three
times a week — within a few
weeks, the number of women still
interested in the new team had
dropped to 50.

Now the squad numbers about
30, although there are only about
22 that are willing to enter into
match play, according to Cullen.

Team members remain
hopeful for a fall season,
however. Matches with Dickin-
son, Shippensburg, Gettysburg,
Rutgers, St. Bonaventure and
Penn State are now being arrang-
ed, and the women ruggers plan
to apply for official club status —
and ABS funds — in September.

iMen’s tennis takes

al

fifth in conference

With one singles player and two doubles tandems
taking second places, the men’s tennis team cap-
tured fifth place at the East Coast Conference
championship last weekend at West Chester.

The netters’ 14 points placed them behind cham-
pion Lafayette (21 points), Temple (20), Delaware
(17) and Lehigh (15). Last year, the Bisons took
third place in the tournament.

Junior Bill Beneke advanced to the finals of the
second singles bracket before losing to third seeded
Rick Stassa of Lafayette, 6-4, 6-2. The unseeded
Beneke upset the second and fourth seeds in
straight sets en route to the finals.

Beneke teamed with classmate Eric Simpson to
finish in the runner up position at second doubles for
the second consecutive year. The third seeded Bison
due swept two opponents before bowing to
Delaware’s Ken Dill and Mark Kurla, 6-3, 7-6 with
the final game being decided in a 5-4 tie breaker.

Also reaching the finals was the first doubles
team of sophomores Steve Haas and Mark
Greenawald. The Bucknell pair bowed to
Delaware’s second seeded Steve Querner and Ran-
dy Cerce in another tie breaker 7-5, 1-6, 7-6, after
leading 5-2 in the final set.

“We were pleased to get that far since we were
unseeded,’’ Haas commented.

In first singles, Haas and Simpson reached the

Trackmen score an upset victory at ECCs

Team title is first for Bisons since 1977 as
balance gives a 40 point margin over St. Joe’s

meet in Bethlehem last weekend.

Ruggers upend Buffalo

By JEFF McCONNELL

The Bucknell All-Blacks hosted the Buf-
fajo Valley Rugby Club to a challenging
afternoon of rugby Saturday and — in this
traditional season wrap-up match — the
All-Blacks defeated Buffalo Valley, 10-3,
the first time in eight seasons Bucknell has
beaten its arch rivals.

The All-Blacks dominated the game ear-

ly when wing forward Jan Baum ’83 °

capitalized on a grubby kick through the
Buffalo Valley defense to score, increasing
the ruggers’ lead to 4-0. Later in the first
half, inside center Shaun Visser ’84 scored
on a long break-away run and — after
senior Steve Dixon’s conversion kick — the
score was 10-0 at half time.

The second half was characterized by
several Buffalo Valley offensives, all of
which were stopped short of a try by the
All-Black defense. Buffalo Valley’s only
points came late in the game, when their
fullback scored from a 25-yard penalty
kick to make the final score 10-3.

The previous weekend Bucknell and Buf-
falo Valley co-hosted the Fourth Annual
Pennsylvania Rugby Classic held here on
campus. The All-Blacks placed third out of
nine teams with a 3-1 record. Bucknell’s
only defeat came at the hands of Delaware
— the eventual runners up in the tourna-
ment — by a 6-3 count in double overtime.
Buffalo Valley took first place with an
unblemished 4-0 mark, defeating
Delaware in the title contest.

Bucknell’s victory over Buffalo Valley
last weekend left them with an 8-4 record
for the spring season. Sporting a relatively
young team, the All-Blacks hope to return
next fall even stronger, as they will lose
but six seniors to graduation.

BETHLEHEM—The Bison trackmen are cham-
pions, again.

Despite being underdogs in the East Coast Con-
ference Championship meet Saturday and Sunday
here at Lehigh, the men’s track and field team
swiped the team title going away, tallying 141 points
to St. Joseph’s 101.5 and Temple’s 74. Three-time
conference winner Delaware had 69.5 while
Lafayette grabbed the fifth spot with 53 points.

It was the first time since 1977 that Bucknell won
the meet.

The trackmen displayed a unique team balance,
completely overwhelming their nine opponents. The
field event athletes contributed 50 of Bucknell’s 141-
point total; the distance runners, 47, and the
sprinters, 44. ‘We had people placing everywhere,”
junior miler Steve Bigotto said.

In fact, orange and blue-clad athletes qualified in
all but two of the twenty events contested.

The Herd fared well Saturday evening, the first
day of competition. In the three final events that
night, Bucknell tallied eight points behind the third
place effort of senior Al Wegener in the javelin and
the fifth place performance of Gary Bartlett in the
hammer throw.

Bartlett, who was Bucknell’s outstanding field
athlete for the two-day meet, threw the hammer
44.78 meters for a new school record. Bucknell also
qualified eight runners for the Sunday finals in trial
races held Saturday night.

The momentum continued Sunday afternoon. In
fact, the momentum never shifted, as the trackmen
controlled the first gun. Nearly every runner,
jumper and thrower who wore an orange jersey did
what they were capable of doing.

Led by Bartlett, Bucknell’s field events picked up
where they left off the night before. Bartlett added a
third place in the shot put with a toss of 15.12
meters, while his 44.24 meter effort in the discus
earned him an individual conference crown.

Valley, 10-3,

Junior Mike Ward and sophomores Jamie Dodd
and Ted Lewis all placed second in their respective
events. Ward threw 15.31 meters in the shot, Dodd
went 14 feet 6 inches in the vault and Lewis cleared 6
feet 8 inches in the high jump.

The only other Bison firsts came in distance
races. Freshman Bill Reifsnyder won the 10,000-
meter run in a meet and track record time of
30:30.26, while junior Rick Sayre’s 9:09.69 easily
out-distanced the field in the 3,000 meter
steeplechase.

Just as impressive in the latter race was the per-
formance of another freshman, Mike Dechert. After
finding himself in eighth place early in the race,
Dechert slowly moved up, finishing a superb sec-
ond. His time of 9:15.69 qualified him for the junior
national meet and the IC4A championship meet
later this year.

* Bucknell’s sprinting corps was as awesome as the
field and distance athletes. Martin Carter ’82
earned top honors in this.category with three second
place finishes and a school record.

Carter ran 10.93 in the 200-meter (good for the new
record) and was on Bucknell’s runner-up 4 x 100
meter relay (49.62).

Another workhorse in the sprints was junior
Rocky Thompson. Despite a slightly-pulled leg mus-
cle, Thompson ran on both relays and placed fifth in
the 110 meter high hurdles.

The competitive attitude that Head Coach Art
Gulden cited as the “key’’ to winning the meet was
best exemplified by junior 800-meter runner Mark
Kaplan. While on a short run Saturday afternoon,
Kaplan severely twisted his left ankle.

Student trainer Sal Baglio ’82 kept the swelling to
a minimum, and Kaplan went out that night and
qualified for the finals in his event with his best time
all year.

Despite the impressiveness of the Bucknell win, it
was not all that unpredictable. The trackmen had a
frequently sluggish spring, but the potential was
there, and their dominance of the ECC meet proved
it.
