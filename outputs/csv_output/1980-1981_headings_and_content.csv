"Vol. 84 No. 1 Bucknell University, Lewisburg, Pa.",
"O'Brien, Smith",
give personnel,
choice to deans,"By DAVID HAWKINGS University President Dennis O'Brien has removed himself and Provost Wendell Smith from ac tive participation in personnel matters as part of a partial reassigning of responsibility within the administration. O'Brien this summer made the decision to give ""primary respon sibility"" for decisionmaking on matters of appointments, reap pointments, tenure, promotion and salary distribution to the deans of the College of Arts and Sciences and Engineering, effec tive at the beginning of this semester. The additional burden placed on the office of Arts and Sciences Dean Robert Chambers has in part prompted the president to also name Professor of Chem istry Manning Smith to the newly created post of associate dean of the college for special projects. Smith's primary responsibility, however, will be to examine ad ministrative and faculty struc tures as a ""means of enhancing collegiality within the Universi ty,"" according to a letter sent to the faculty June 27 by O'Brien. The appointment of Smith to the three-year temporary posi tion and the shifting of respon sibility for personnel decisions are meant to remove the ""ge nuine confusion"" and ""dissatis faction"" expressed by both the faculty and the administration- including the president and provost--about the division of power in staff hiring and firing, O'Brien said. In the past, questions concern ing personnel matters have been referred to the offices of the president, the provost, the two deans, department chairman and assorted other faculty and staff, creating a confusion ""among almost everybody"" -- according to O'Brien -- as to who acted and who spoke for the University. The president said he was not ""backing out"" of working on the often-sensitive areas of tenure and merit salary increases."
MANNING SMITH,"In his letter to the faculty, O'Brien said he would remain ""a half-step back from personnel decisions,"" but in an interview Wednesday he said he ""cannot conceive of reversing a decision"" made by the deans. The provost will remain as dis tant from the actions taken by Chambers and Engineering Dean Barry Maxwell, but both he and the president will continue to give final review to all decisions before passing them to the board of trustees for final approval. Wendell Smith's role in the ad ministration will now focus more closely on matters of University planning and overall policy. O'Brien said he will now concen trate his efforts in development and fund raising for the multi million dollar ""Campaign for the 80s"" to be announced within the year. Assistant to the Provost Judith Becker will continue to review all matters of employment because of her dual role as the Universi ty's Affirmative Action Officer. Manning Smith, Chambers and Maxwell will constitute a ""kind of administrative tenure commit tee"" because of the reorganiza tion, Chambers said. No increase in salary is planned for the new dean, who has taught here since 1946. It is not known yet if Smith will retire when his position in the College of Arts and Sciences ends in 1983. He will continue to teach part- time in chemistry until then."
Officers endorse union;,
security changes slated,"By TRICIA KENNEDY A reorganization of Campus Security under the direction of Vice President for Administra tion and Finance John Zeller has resulted in increased hostilities between the security officers and the administration, according to both the officers and Zeller. This reorganization plan comes on the heels of a vote by security personnel to join a union several months ago. They are the first workers' group to unionize in the history of the University. In the first formal meeting be tween the two sides since the union vote, Security Corporal Ed Roberts -- who represents the of ficers -- the union local president and the local's lawyer presented University Controller F. Ellis Harley Tuesday with a list of demands including better work ing conditions, a wage increase and improved retirement bene fits. Harley was acting in place of Zeller, who had routine surgery the previous day. The administration's decision to restructure security -- a step which involves replacing Chief of Security Norman Fine with a new security director -- has led to speculation that the University administration is forcing Fine to retire. Zeller denied this, saying Fine ""had indicated a desire to retire."" Plans for restructuring the department have also been underway ""for some time,"" he said. The administration postponed advertising for a new director un til after the union election because ""It was not appropriate to indicate we were going to change the structure (of campus security) or reorganize it in the middle of the election process,"" according to Zeller. Provisions for the newly created post require that the ap plicant hold a bachelor's degree, preferably in the administration of justice or a related field. Preferred qualifications are a master's degree in public safety m a n a g e m e n t and a demonstrated ability in exerting leadership in a campus environ ment in order to promote student safety and welfare, according to the published job description. Zeller said he hopes to improve the quality of campus security by only looking at candidates from outside the present staff. The responsibilities of the new director will include fire safety, accident prevention, hazardous waste disposal and enforcement of the Occupational Safety and Hazards Act. ""We wanted this not to be just a law enforcement job,"" Zeller said. But Roberts contends the ad ministration is ""choosing to ig nore the fact"" that the University already has a chief of security See SECURITY, page 6"

Crackdown on drinking to leave Greek-Week dry,"By THOMAS DeCAIN A shift in administration policy toward the enforcement of campus alcohol con sumption regulations has made the hall party and Swartz field beer celebrations a thing of the past. University policy states that ""The con sumption of alcoholic beverages is pro hibited in the main public rooms or similar common areas of the residence halls, in non-residential University buildings, and out-of-doors on the campus."" However, tacit approval for keg parties has been the standard. Gerald Commer- ford, associate director of residential life, said he has ""looked the other way"" when hall parties were held in the past. Such will not be the case this year, Com- merford said. The University is now seek ing to strictly enforce the policy this year. Last year, beer was served at Swartz field during Greek Weekend festivities. The beer was served in the parking lot of an adjacent fraternity, while most of it was consumed on University-owned Swartz field. This year, however, alcohol will not be served outdoors. Fraternities will provide the beverages only in their houses. The graduation tent party, a University- sponsored event, also disposes a large volume of beer. Traditionally held at the athletic field next to the Davis Gym nasium, the party will be held again this year and will continue to serve beer, ac cording to Commerford. Hall parties which serve alcohol in ""public rooms"" or in ""common areas"" are prohibited. Fraternities and sororities are permitted to serve alcohol because they are privately owned or independently operated. Most fraternities are owned by a national headquarters, and each sorority rents its suite from the University. Although ""The consumption of alcoholic beverages is prohibited in...and out-of- doors on campus,"" Commerford said that ""if we tried to change the entire behavior of students at once--especially all over the campus--that would require many Gerry Commerfords."" Persons have rarely been detained or ar rested by Campus Security, but it is uncer tain by what means the University will en force this rule. According to Resident Director for Roberts Hall, Libet Hall '80, ""Parties should not oe just for one to get smashed. Bucknell is looking beyond that and is try ing to have a greater concern for the in dividual. The law is important but secon dary."" Residential Life, upon making its deci sion, informed its resident directors and the resident assistants of the outcome. At the first scheduled hall meeting the resi dent assistants were instructed to remind See GREEK-WEEK, page 7"

Vice president hired after year-long delay,"By JAN BALAK1AN John A. Ferguson, executive director of the Institute for Policy Analysis in Indianapolis, Ind. since 1977, took office June 1 as vice president for University relations. University President Dennis O'Brien attributed the one-year search for the vice president to the difficulty of the position. "" We wanted someone who would do well in the developmental world while having academic sensibili ty,"" O'Brien said. The absence of a vice president for university relations last year has had no adverse effects on fund raising efforts, according to O'Brien. "" Last year was one of our best years financially,"" he said. The University is relying on Ferguson's leadership to meet a 1987 multi-million dollar fund drive, the president said. Ferguson, 36, meets the re quirement of being connected with the foundation world and the academic world. His work with the Institute for Policy Anaylsis has included research and policy analysis, and evaluation and planning for corporate, public and private grant making agen cies and foundations. He previously served as a staff associate with the Carnegie Com mission on Higher Education. From 1967-71, he held a variety of positions at Wayne State Univer sity in Detroit. Ferguson has also served as a consultant to colleges and univer sities, professional associations, corporations, civic organizations and foundations. An alumnus of Brown Universi ty, Ferguson received a master's degree from Wayne State and a doctorate in higher education,. economics and history from the University of Michigan. Fer guson's position will deal with all areas of development. In an in terview with the Bucknellian this week, he explained the three aspects of development: deferred giving, gifts from corporations and foundations and the annual fund, which provides "" the last ounce of flexibility in the Univer sity's budget,"" according to Ferguson. In addition, he will deal with alumni affairs, publications and public relations. Ferguson said he is responsible for presenting the image of Bucknell to the out side world. Ferguson is reluctant to unveil his views on higher education or any transformations he would like to see here because, he said, he is "" still meeting people and still learning."" The only goals he spoke of were those of increasing the Universi ty's annual giving to $1.25 million and augmenting participation of the alumni in fund raising. Ferguson said he has always been interested in the admini strative aspect of education. "" Since World War II, when state institutions acquired a larger population, there has been a bat tle to promote excellence in private institutions. "" We need a healthy private sector,""  he said. As he looks into the case of the 1980's, Ferguson wants to spend time with all aspects of the con stituency of the University and find out what they want. "" I want to establish priorities from both the capital point of view and an educational point of view,""  he said."

Workmen have rapidly completed the foundation and steel,
"framing of the new Computer Center. The complex,",
"located adjacent to the Dana Engineering building, is",
scheduled to open to students in February. This is the first,
major construction project the University has undertaken,
since the completion of the field house in 1978.,
Computer center finish,
slated for mid-February,"ByGREGHAHN Construction of the new computer and engineering center con tinues on schedule. The complex, located adjacent to the Dana Engineering building, is scheduled to open Feb. 15. The new building fulfills a variety of needs, according to John Zeller, vice president for administration and finance. The present computer is operating at full capacity and cannot meet the addi tional load required of it. It has remained in use longer than its normal life expectancy, creating a costly maintenance problem. The new computer, a Honeywell unit, must operate in conjunc tion with the present system for about one year. This would not be possible without the construction of a new center, Zeller said. Unlike the computer in use now, the Honeywell unit will be hous ed in a fire-proof building which will also provide additional space needed by the engineering department. Costs for the entire computer center project exceed $3 million. The computer system alone claims $1 million of the budget, with conversion and transition costs expected to reach $300,000. The new buildings and its furnishings are expected to cost $1.3 million. Included in the computer center project is the remodeling of the Dana Engineering building. Renovations are expected to cost close to $250,000. The most costly item is a $135,000 sprinkler system to be installed during the summer of 1982. Four engineering labs have also been earmarked to receive $200,000 worth of new equipment. Funding for the center has been provided by corporate donations. This covers about half of the total projected expenses to date. Ac cording to Zeller, there are no plans to solicit donations from alum ni or parents. The new Honeywell computer system will need to be replaced with another new computer in about ten years, Zeller said."
Teamsters hope for success,
where AFSCME has failed,"By MADELON HENEHAN The Teamsters and Chauffeurs Local Union No. 764 has begun a campaign to unionize non professional employees here. The Teamsters efforts' come after three years of unsuccessful attempts to organize the same group by the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME). Alfred Byrd, Secretary-Treasurer and Business Representative of the Teamsters local, has been working to organize the physical plant and dining service employees since June. It is uncertain whether AFSCME is still seeking to unionize the same target group, however. William Fogle, staff representative of AFSCME has not been available for comment. Employees have not received word from AFSCME recently. According to Byrd, the Teamsters is working in dependently to organize the non-professionals, and will not work in cooperation with AFSCME. Fogle has admitted to having spent "" quite a bit of money""  in his unsuccessful campaign and stated in August that he would "" proceed with caution"" if University employees again expressed an interest in union representation. Non-professionals voted 3-1 against joining AFSCME in April 1979. Employee requests for representation led the Teamsters to get involved, according to Byrd. The Teamsters expect to be successful where AFSCME has failed. The Teamsters has sent letters and authorization cards to employees. These cards, ask the employees to designate the Teamsters as their sole bargaining agent. If 30 percent of the employees return their pledge cards to the union, the Teamsters will be able to petition the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) for an election. If a majority sign the cards, the union may ask the NLRB to be their collective bargaining agent. John BeD, director of the physical plant, is oppos ed to unionizing. "" Workers do not need to belong to a union,""  he said. "" We do more for our workers than the union which would bring a separation between employees and management. The workers are our friends and are treated as so. We don't want to consider them as anything different,""  Bell said."
Ward '17 dies;,
bequeaths gift,
to University,"A bequest to the University of between $200,000 and $400,000 is expected from the estate of Ethel V. Ward, a Bucknell alumna and local resident who died Aug. 29. According to sources in the ad ministration, Ward -- a 1917 graduate -- had included a substantial gift of this type in her will, which is still in probate. McClure & Light, the law firm handling the Ward case, said it is taking inventory of the estate now, and will not release until early next week the exact amount of the gift."
FIREWORKS EXPLODE OVER STADIUM -- The beginning of the,
fall semester was ushered in by a display of pyrotechnics high,

part of the festivities that included an all-campus picnic on,
"Swartz field, entertainment by two bands and a frisbee show,",
all sponsored by the University.,"A resident of Lewisburg since 1972, Ward sold her honse on St. George Street to the University, which uses it now as the campus' official guest house. She served as hostess of the house until shortly before her death."

In the mining town of Katowice, new party leader Stanislaw Kania appealed to his party members to help the coun try return to a normal work schedule.

Bell's staff of almost 165 workers tackled other major pro jects this summer as well. New trees were planted outside Memorial Stadium, where seat covers were installed in one sec tion to separate the Bucknell spectator section from other seats. The fence surrounding the stadium was painted as well. ""Most people notice the im provements around them,"" Bell said, ""but no one sees the things buried under the ground,"" refer ring to the replacement and up dating of a transformer system for Taylor and Kress Halls and the Botany Building. The staff also modified and im proved electrical service to the Sports/Recreation Complex, Davis Gymnasium and Bucknell West.

Roberts said the reason most people cited for voting in favor of the offer made by the United Plant Guard Workers was the promise that unionization would guarantee Campus Security per sonnel the full emergency train ing they say they are entitled to receive as sworn police officers. Roberts said the administra tion had refused "" to allow us to reorganize the department into a useful organization."" The hiring of a new security director with additional qualifications would produce all the changes in policy "" we have fought so hard to receive,""  he said. As far back as 1976, the securi ty staff made a written request "" asking the University to send the security men back to school to have certified state training so we can better protect the Enclosed is $1.00.

SUSQUEHANNA VALLEY MALL,"students and University proper- ty. "" We feel we should have this training also for our personal safety,""  the request said. "" Our job' is no longer just a night watchman's."" Similar statements and re quests have been issued by members of Campus Security concerning fire preparedness, possible relocation of the security office and the need for 24-hour campus security protection, ac cording to Roberts. Security staff members say that the sudden decision by the administration to reorganize after ignoring officers' past re quests is a retaliation in response to the recent unionization vote. Bell categorically denied these allegations. He said the work on reorganization began more than two years ago. He named in creased incidents of disorderly conduct, tampering with fire equipment, an increase in inter- * nal theft and a need to bring the fraternities under University- sponsored protection as reasons which influenced the decision to renovate campus protection. "" Things were leaning over too much to the local police side rather than the security side,"" Bell said. According to the officers, the administration contends that the job of Campus Security is to be simply the "" eyes and ears""  of the campus and should not be in volved directly in apprehending and arresting students or ad- ministeriqg medical assistance other than basic first aid and cardio-pulmonary resuscitation. Campus Security has two-way radio contact with the local am bulance service, fire company and police offices should emergencies or major incidents arise at the present time. It would be a waste of time and money to train security officers to handle these emergencies and major incidents, which occur on ly rarely, Bell said. Fine sharply disagreed with this statement, saying that within the past few months Campus Security had prevented an at tempted suicide by an under graduate student here "" just in time."" A committee to select the new security director is presently reviewing applicants for the job. The group -- chaired by Dean of Student Affairs John Dunlop and including Director of Residential Life Brenda Gordon, Associate Professor of Sociology Matthew Silberman, Bell and two recent alumni -- has already invited three candidates here for inter views. : A i '"

River bridge opens today,"The river bridge spanning the Susquehanna River at the foot of Market Street is scheduled to reopen today. A ribbon-cutting ceremony featuring local officials such as the mayor and Police Chief Donald Heiter was scheduled for 10 a.m. The festivities were to include a promotion in which the first motorists to cross the newly refurbished bridge would receive "" Welcome back to Lewisburg""  souvenir bags. The bridge was closed July 14 for the replacement of a deteriorated concrete deck and other modernization. The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation had imposed a 60- day limit on the contractor, Zeisloft Construction Co. of Bloomsburg, and the group finished work 48 hours before the deadline. Additional work which can be done while the bridge is in use is scheduled to be completed by the end of November."

University convocation,
marks start o f semester,
Registrar releases G.P.A.,
stats; women score well,"By ROBIN MEREDITH Increased attendance marked the 134th annual Bucknell Con vocation last week with sources estimating as many as one-third more persons in attendance, over last year's record. There was also greater attendance by facul ty members and upperclassmen. The attendance record is at tributed to the new location of the ceremonies, which in the past have been held in Rooke Chapel. This year's convocation took place in the Freshman Quad. President Dennis O'Brien spoke on changes in attitudes of students. He called his address: "" We don't need no education."" Explaining the significance of the line taken from Pink Floyd's best selling album "" The Wall,"" O'Brien received an ovation for his quotation of the chorus of "" Brick in the Wall."" Recovering with the remark, "" What is this world coming to?,"" O'Brien went on to assert Plato's view that "" changes in musical style are always accompanied by profound changes in the culture of the people."" Referring to his younger days, the president then traced the path of popular music to the pre sent, drawing parallels with the student's attitude on the college campus through each time seg ment and commenting on the changes in the institutions of youth itself. "" Rock is not a music of talk, but show; not mediacy but im mediacy."" He furthered that no tion by adding, "" I believe it says something significant to move from music of delay to a music of demand, from music of 'give me' to 'gotcha'."" O'Brien concluded that while there may be some disagreement on whether college is the last refuge of youth or the first stage of adulthood, we are all heading in the same direction. Though it may be to a different"

At the end of the speech, Dean Robert Chambers took his place to announce and congratulate award winners among the ad ministration, faculty members and students. New members of the two top honor societies, Phi Beta Kappa and Tau Beta Pi were also announced. By MATT KARANIAN The mean grade point average for undergraduate students here last semester was 2.9, according to statistics recently released by the Office of the Registrar. Women consistently scored higher G.P.A.s than did the men, and all non-fraternity men and women scored higher than the fraternity men and women. The Registrar's statistics ap pear to indicate that a trend of steady improvement occurs with students. Mean grade point averages for men are recorded as 2.7 for freshmen, 2.8 for sophomores, and 3.0 for juniors and seniors. G.P.A.s for women range from 2.9 for freshmen and sophomores to 3.2 for juniors and 3.3 for s e n i o r s .

Local police to provide emergency service to Union,"By CATHY NAGEL and MATT KARANIAN The Lewisburg Police Depart ment has contracted an agree ment with the nearby township of Union to answer emergency calls in that area. According to Lewisburg Police Chief Donald Heiter, the contract is in effect for a trial six-month period, after which time it may or may not be renewed. The contract went into effect Aug. 19. Union township will pay Lewisburg police $15 per hour in overtime pay for calls to which it responds. The agreement calls for Lewisburg to answer only emergency calls in Union. Heiter's two-car police force has leased a third car for a six month period to aid in the handl ing of extra calls. Lewisburg is also maintaining a mutual agreement with East Buffalo Township for each of the forces to respond to calls in the other's township in event of emergency. In a statement to students, Heiter said he hoped students would "" behave and act like you would in your own home. "" We're here to help the students. If they have any pro blems or need assistance, we're glad to help,""  Heiter said, adding that calls about illegal handguns on campus were answered "" im mediately"" by his force last year."
"Greek-Week, hall partys,victim",

One R.A. said that he had become a watch-dog for the police, and he might not have taken the position had he known of the policy in advance. "" They just sprang it on us when we got here,""  he said. The Resident Director for Swartz Hall, Missy Farmer, said the change has come about because of "" a new alcohol awareness which is spreading across the country. Students can drink in their rooms just as their home,"" Farmer said. Hall and several resident assistants say the University is enforcing the ban to release itself from any liabilities which might result if the University allowed alcoholic consumption on its pro perty. None referred to a particular instance, however, in which a stu dent was injured directly because alcohol was served at a hall par ty. According to Commerford, an accident at Delaware Valley Col lege in 1978 in which a student was killed has led to concern at Bucknell and other Pennsylvania schools. The student had been drinking at a college sponsored event."

Better late than never?,
The University has finally decided that it is time to streamline,
"the Campus Security force, and it has begun to accomplish this goal",
"by seeking a new director of security, "" a professional"" who will "" tell",
"us how to reorganize our operation,""  in the words of John Zeller.",
We can see nothing wrong with this. The men on the force of,
Campus Security are--by their own admission-- a group of night,
watchmen. They are not confident of their ability to deal with the,
most crucial emergencies that can occur anytime on campus.,
"This is not by matter of choice, however. Since 1976, Campus",
Security officers have been sending written requests to the ad,
ministration asking for more and better education; they sought to go,
back to school to receive certified state training that would enable,
"them to better protect the students, University property and",
themselves.,
The security forces voted to join a union June 12 and im,
mediately following this decision the University countered with their,
new plan for reorganization. Although Zeller and John Bell contend,
"they have been planning this action for some time, the patrolmen see",
"more significance in this "" better late than never"" policy.",
The officers now fear they may become obsolete when the new,
"plan is implemented and the "" new man"" at the top takes over. They",
do not want to be the victims of what they see as the punitive,
backlash as a result of their unprecedented decision to become,
"unionized. Will a rapport with students, years of experience with",
this University and the officers' continuous and significant plea for,
"state training result in a stamp of "" Unqualified"" once Chief Norman",
Fine's 20-year tenure here ends in December? We hope not.,
The campus is long overdue for a better system of campus,
security and the officer's plea for training must be answered.,
Continued evasiveness and procrastination by the University on,
these issues is clearly detrimental to what could be a matter of life,
and death.,
To beer or not to beer,
A seemingly major policy shift in the University's enforcement of,
"its public drinking regulations has gone into effect, and we see both",
good and bad aspects to the change.,
"Except for football games, the administration has, for the most",
"part, failed to enforce its policy against consuming alcohol outdoors",
"and in the public areas of residence halls. Now, it has pronounced a",
major crackdown on such drinking.,
The traditional freshman hall keg parties and open carousing on,
Swartz field now seem to be a thing of the past. Perhaps the Univer,
sity feels that a freshman's exposure to alcohol should be the respon,
sibility solely of the fraternities.,
Whatever the intent of the policy change and its effects on student,
"drinking habits, we must admit that there are benefits to be gained",
"from the move. Although the parties are gone, so is the resulting",
destruction of Trax and Kress Halls. Freshmen will also have a,
chance to adjust to college life before being bombarded with endless,
bottles of Budweiser.,
"However, any gains are overshadowed by what we feel is a double",
standard in the policy: the University will continue to permit alcohol,
at the annual graduation tent party.,
"We feel that a more specific policy should be formulated, and that",
the traditional administration haziness on discipline questions be,
"reduced. A new attitude is fine, but uniformity and clarity in en",
"forcement has always been sorely lacking, and this must be",
changed.,
"Drafting tables, dynamite",
We have long reiterated that the quality of the student body is cor,
relative to its organizations and extracurricular activities In the,
"past, we have crammed for hours in the dingy basement of Roberts",
Hall to produce the best student newspaper possible given a severe,
lack of facilities and equipment.,
. . . . . . .,
.,
.,
"Last spring we cried out to the administration for help, and John",
"Zeller, John Bell and Bob Millward answered. The Bucknellian of",
fice has,
a new look and we aren't dingy anymore.,
While the mere request for a paltry drafting table incited a,
crashing scrutiny from our peers on the ABS Appropriations Com,
"mittee, the Physical Plant diligently decimated the basement with",
dynamite to create some new office space for us. The walls are,
"bright white, the carpet royal blue. Our office is no longer a cellar.",

Stereo wars: sensurround in the freshman quad,"By TODD G. BUCHHOLZ Fresh m an are curious creatures. They're fun, novelty items to watch and laugh at. Believe me, the animal behavior folks forget their baboons and rhesus monkeys when the species, Freshman walks by. The Freshman quad, where, like Great Adventure, one can see Frosh in their natural habitat, is marked by blaring music. Not just loud, but the kind they used in the movie "" Earthquake""  to achieve the sensurround effect. Sometimes I wonder how stable Kress and Trax are. To be fair, I admit the cacophony usually comes from the men's dorms. Why? Welcome to the pop-psychology show. After guys are left here by Mom and Dad, their egos and senses of security and masculini ty are vulnerable. Nobody cares that you were voted "" jock of the century""  at Mifflinburg High School. Nobody wants to hear about your girlfriends or the car you left back home. What then, can you do to tell the world what a gift you are? How does the male freshman Bucknel- lensis assert his masculinity? He simply attaches a few wires and jacks, arranges his speakers, and bombards the cosmos with Foreigner. Sure, everybody on campus has # a stereo but I submit only the"
THE,
BUCH,
STOP,"freshmen guys feel obligated to their egos to let the world share in their quest for security and recognition. Walk by the frats. Unless there's a band party, the music levels are pretty low. The up- perclass dorms are reasonably quiet. In fact, often you can hear some nice jazz or evert classical tunes, as scandalous as that may sound. Yes, only Kress and Trax sound like the setting of "" Apocalypse Now."" Last year the two guys next to my room had a passion for noise. Strangely, this passion grew more intense in proportion to my need for sleep and the lateness of the hour. Remember the big bang theory of creation? It started next door to my room. So one day, while blasting a racket that could have awoken Rip Van Winkle, or at least tumbled Jericho, my neighbors were emasculated, symbolically of course. Their tweeters broke. All was silent, except for the cries of the castrati neighbors. How terrible it was for John and Jeff. How depressing, how horrid. How delightful. That day I learned how the Britons must have felt when the bombing stopped. In time, of course, the tweeters were repaired and the bombing resumed. But that brief respite was my "" finest hour."" Yes, my roommate and I had a stereo in our room. Yes, I felt the same pressures and insecurities. But, my friends, I had an excuse: Music 100. See STEREO, page 11"

The collectivists: out on the left wing,
By RICHARD PISANO,"One of the unpublicized and least discussed topics at Bucknell is that our political science and economics depart ments have been overrun by pro fessors who are collectivist. For those unfamiliar with the term, Fredrich Hayek defines collectivism as "" the deliberate organization of the labors of society for a definite social goal."" This includes Marxists, Maoists and Social Democrats. The administration satisfies itself by stating that the Universi ty, as a whole, is ideologically "" balanced.""  And, as a whole, Bucknell is balanced, for in stance, in the management department there are quite a few supporters of the free-market system. However, in the departments where politics is being taught as a field of study and where ideo logical beliefs play into the course matter directly, Bucknell students are being presented with only one point of view. Most professors in introductory level courses attempt to present many points of view to their classes, but in upper level"

It is hard for me to imagine Professor Steve Stamos taking a pro-multinational corporation position in his developing coun tries course, or Professor Dick Peterec arguing with conviction for a free-market position, in the current events portion of every political geography class. These two professors are among the best at the University and enroll ment in their classes will pro bably continue to be outstanding. But Bucknell is doing its stu dent body an injustice by not employing professors who will # argue just as dynamically and persuasively from an opposing point of view. Before a new professor is hired, many applications are screened by a department. A few ap plicants art then asked to come to the University where they are interview ed by interested students and the professors in the department. The department then makes a recommendation to the ad ministration whose job it is to make the final offer. When a department recom mends applicants of only one political persuasion, the Univer sity will hire only professors of the persuasion. If the administration were to ask a department to hire a pro fessor primarily on the basis of ideology, a cry would sound that the administration was violating the "" academic freedom""  of the professor. Academic freedom refers to the freedom of a professor to teach what he sees fit, as he sees fit, without outside interference. On paper, academic freedom would seem to insure an environ"

In reality, academic freedom has been a cloak behind which collec tivist professors have been able to strike at the social and economic foundations of our society without opposition. I agree with William F. Buckley, Jr., when he said that academic freedom should mean "" freedom of men and women to supervise the educational ac tivities and aims of the schools they oversee and support."" The U niversity's prim ary responsibility should be to pro vide an excellent, balanced education for its students. Unfortunately, President O'Brien's administration has met this commitment with rhetoric only. If the feathers in the caps of some of the departments have to be ruffled to provide a balanced education, it is certainly worth doing so. Someday if there is enough pressure exerted on President O'Brien by the students, alumni and especially trustees, I am con fident that his administration will act.

Page 11,"To The Editor: ""The legitimate object of government is to do for a com munity of people whatever they need to have done, but cannot do at all in their separate and in dividual capacities,"" said Abraham Lincoln approximately 120 years ago. At Bucknell, the Association of Bucknell Students (ABS) at tempts to follow Lincoln's max im. The ABS is concerned with all aspects of student life. And it is responsible for taking ap propriate action when issues of concern to students arise. Although many students are very skeptical of the ABS's in fluence in the decision making process at Bucknell, the ABS has recently been successful in changing two University policies and is working hard to reform several others. For example, last year the ABS helped establish a midterm break for the 1980 Fall semester. After continued attempts, the ABS was able to persuade the Administra tion to accept a plan to change recycling from a voluntary effort to an official University policy. This included the cessation of in cinerator use in Marts and Cole' man Halls. For these successes to con tinue, students must work together. We should remember the importance of student activi ty in maintaining a vibrant and creative college community. The quality of education at Bucknell is in jeopardy as costs of educa tion continue to rise. It is in the entire Bucknell com munity's interest to get the most out of our human and material resources. If our wasteful ex travagance continues, the quality of education and life at Bucknell will be stunted in the years ahead. We students can prevent a qualitative erosion by focusing our combined energies on press ing problems. If we do not cooperate, we will defeat ourselves. To avoid this, the ABS will work closely with other student groups and with the faculty and administration. For student goals to be fulfilled, we must act responsibly and lead by example. Toward this end, ABS Steering Committee efforts this semester will focus primarily on reforming University policy. Our agenda will include :"

Remember it's the guy who blows his horn the loudest who is usually in the fog. 1. The creation of a more sup portive University policy towards student activities. Adequate space for campus organizations will be sought. The ABS will work for a more com plementary relationship between student activities and the cur riculum. Of particular interest will be the emphasis placed on forms of creative expression such as journalism, and on community oriented studies. For example, a civil engineer ing project to develop a design for the newly dedicated Hufnagle Park in Lewisburg will be pur sued and encouraged. There are many potential benefits to be derived from eliminating some of the rigidity which exists between student ac tivities and curriculum, ranging from a broader educational ex perience to fighting inflation by increasing community self- reliance. 2. The elimination of waste in cluding vandalism. A major goal is recycling in the waste disposal process by the end of this year. Also, reminders to students about food and energy waste will be highly visible. We should remember that we pay for waste with our tuition dollars. 3. The formation of a Public In terest Research Group (PIRG). A PIRG is a non-profit, non partisan corporation set up and run by students to improve life in the community. For example, PIRG's in Oregon fought bottlers' efforts to repeal a returnable- bottle law. If current student activities funds were insufficient, a Bucknell PIRG might be funded by an increase in the student ac tivities fee, all of which would re main completely under the con trol of the ABS Appropriations Committee. For an increase to take effect, a campus-wide referendum, to be decided by a majority vote, would have to be held. 4. Greater student participa tion in the selection of com mencement speakers. 5. We remain very interested in intercollegiate cooperation. The Steering Committee is op timistic about the potential im pact of a more unified national student movement. These objectives are within our reach and are compatible with the goals of the University. Their implementation would help pave the road to a heightening of a sense of community at Bucknell and among University and area residents. As college students, we have the time, energy and resources needed to take the lead in ad vocating the cooperative ap proaches, short-run sacrifices and long-term thinking essen tial for maintaining the liberty and standard of living cherished by us and dreamed of by many. Let us not take for granted our current prosperity. Its social and economic bases were founded on cheap energy and an expanding labor force--two conditions that no longer exist. An active student movement is crucial for developing the com munity spirit to overcome the shortcomings of the past and the challenges of the future. Let us get on with the job.

Campus inspires transfer student,"By CATHY BRITT After spending my freshman year at Albany State University, I made the big switch to Bucknell. My reasons for leaving weren't com plicated. Although I've left many friends behind, I wanted to attend a smaller university where instead of being a number on a computer, I would be an in dividual. Academic considerations also entered into the move. As a sophomore currently majoring in elementary education, I was impressed by the program made available tome. Photo--Public Relations"
BUT WHERE DO I GO NOW? The alpha,
bet is always harder than it looks.,
Upperclass guides led bewildered frosh,
through registration.,"From the first moment I stepped into Lewisburg, I was happy with my decision. Albany's campus is located on flat ground, and all the buildings and dormitories are built of white cement. During the winter, heavy snowfall turns the entire area white, and, after a while, it becomes bleak and depressing. The trees and Georgian brick of Bucknell is certainly a welcome change. It's so much easier to study in a place that actually looks and feels like a college, rather than a hospital. The main impetus for my transfer was that at Albany there was an average of 400 to 500 students in each of my classes, a number I felt was far too high to receive any individual attention from the faculty. At Bucknell, the number has decreased to, at most, 30. It's not that my former professors weren't interested in their students; it's just that here professors are able, through reduced class size, to do so much more. For one thing, I couldn't believe that in structors here actually learn their stu dents' names. An important facet of education, class discussion, was absent at Albany. In a class of 400, it just wasn't feasible, as long lectures were the order of the day. Here, judging from professors' comments and the first few days of classes, discussion is a much larger part of the learning process. Before, no one would think to ask a ques tion in class. There was simply too many people. I think Bucknell students should be grateful for the chance to discuss subjects and exchange ideas, rather than being just human tape recorders. As for the disadvantages, I have found it more difficult to become acquainted with my fellow classmates as a transfer than I did when I was a freshman. Freshmen all make friends with each other quickly as they are all in the same situation. But not knowing anyone and be ing away from home for the first time is different for me, and there are very few transfers here. Part of the problem is that I've been placed in a special interest house, rather than a dorm. I miss the atmosphere of dor mitory life and the activities hall groups plan. Only yesterday did my roommate and I venture to the third floor of Seventh Street House to meet our housemates. Another aspect I miss is city life itself. At Bucknell, everything is self contained; if you don't have a car, you don't leave campus much. At Albany, bus services were available to shopping malls, theatres and museums. In Lewisburg, students are more at the mercy of what campus life offers. Despite these difficulties, students have been friendly. Through my classes and ex tracurricular activities, I'm meeting many people. It's a bit lonely at first, but in a month or so as I get settled in, I believe I'll feel more confident in my decision to transfer. Photo-- Public Relations"

Freshman camp provides head start,"By SUE CHIAVETTA Do you like bugs up your nose? How about cold showers and human knots? If the answer to these questions is yes, you would have enjoyed this year's Freshman Camp. Held Labor Day weekend at Cowan, ap proximately eight miles from campus, this two-day adventure was one of tne most unique learning experiences you could ever hope to encounter. For the most part, close to 100 freshmen and upperclass counselors square danced, played human bingo and held touchie-feelie sessions. Although they may seem silly to outsiders, campers really enjoyed these and other lighthearted activities. The inevitable discomforts of camping life were taken good-naturedly. ""Two cold showers with sixty guys made it an un forgettable experience,"" shrugged John Held '84. Despite the crazy games for zany peo ple, Freshman Camp had its more serious moments as well. It gave members a chance to meet professors, deans and President O'Brien himself. More im portantly, 76 freshmen had the opportunity to get acquainted with each other before the hassle of classes began. ""It was a good experience. If I hadn't gone, I would not feel as much at home as I do now. It's great to see familiar faces around campus,"" said Julie Reed '84. Her words were underscored by Ruth Bur nham, assistant director of student ac tivities. ""The goal of Freshman Camp was to give its participants a headstart on Bucknell life. Just a few new friends help."" In addition to promoting friendships, Freshman Camp brought many pairs of roommates together for the first time. ""When we arrived back at school on Tues day morning, we were no longer homesick or scared. ""We already knew each other,"" said Wendy Denton '84. New roommates Guy Zaybakian and Chris Knudson took it one step further. After they met, they decided to play their guitars together for the camp's meditation period and ended the night taking requests by the campfire. The enthusiasm of the freshmen was matched by that of the upperclassmen in volved. ""Not only did the camp provide a headstart for freshmen, it strengthened bonds of friendship between counselors,"" said Laura Callahan '83. The only criticism many of them shared was the shortness and limited enrollment of the weekend. ""I wish two or three sessions of the camp could be held, so all freshmen who wanted to could attend. As is, many of them had to be turned away."" ""Every year we consider if the disad-- vantages of not being able to ac commodate all students interested outweighs the advantages of the camp,"" said James Hammerlee, director dent activities. ""So far, we've coil that they don't. The lottery syste^ perfect, but it's fair, and every that mails in his application on timel equal chance. Logistically, therj other way to do it."" A second camp held the week school began was given a try severs ago. However, by that time most i had become so involved in class freshman hall activities that the was no longer there. ""It has to be i weekend before classes,"" conclude<<! merlee. It is unfortunate that more studeJ not attend Freshman Camp. ButT ship, fun and a few bugs mac| memorable experience for all of did."

This form supplied demographic and factual information to the University on its new students. Dr. Wilder hopes, however, to eventually restore the interest test because it was ""one of the most ac curate predictors of college majors we possess."" Just what can the tests be used for? ""If a person is not sure where his or her in terests lie, we can point out suitable courses they may have missed. But the tests are only guides; they are not infalli ble,"" answered Dr. Wilder. It is also possible, by perusing different sections of the testing program, to judge why a student is not doing as well as he said James Hammerlee, director of stu dent activities. ""So far, we've concluded that they don't. The lottery system isn t perfect, but it's fair, and every student that mails in his application on tune has an equal chance.

Briefly, the tests can be used to measure quality of work habits, scholastic attitude and practical ability. Even if you've waited two years to find out your results, Wilder says you're not too late. Freshman tests can support students in their choice of a major, or point them in the right direction if they're planning a switch. Don't expect miracles; but the Freshman Testing Program is as good a guide to the future as your average horoscope. ~**L>"
PS*,"The obscure nature of many of the ques tions helps contribute to student puzzle ment over the purpose of the tests. In quiries on preference of carrot cooking styles and sleeping habits are but two ex amples. This year, in response to a more recent question, freshmen can be found walking up steps counting how many stairs they take at a time. ""No deep, underlying meaning is behind any of our questions. Our intention is to collect large amounts of data on an incom ing class of freshmen, then group their answers according to what they decide to major in. When future students come along, we check their answers and see what majors they fit into,"" explained Dr. David Wilder, director of the counseling service.

We now have to take respon sibility for our lives; there is no one there to lend a hand when we fall. The ties to home must be loosened tem porarily. For some freshmen the ex perience is totally new, and many have spent moments missing family and friends while at the same time trying to get started on a new social and academic career. Everyone is handling this pressure dif ferently. One member of our class, a resi dent of 1st Kress, is surrounding his room with a myriad of"

Then, of course, there is the wandering candidate for Freshman Gass President, whose en tire wardrobe seems to consist of a blue suit and green sneakers. Most members of the Class of '84, however, are using their new freedom in more conventional ways. The first few days held a spree of meetings, official welcomes and assemblies, as well as the first taste of col lege classes. Fortunately, the first few days also featured parties. They were everywhere, and students scrambled to make new friends. Although during our first hall meeting we were informed of the abolition of hall parties, this dilemma was easily solved. In fact, the first few nights were non-stop bashes. Even convocation"

your grade on a history,
"paper will be forgotten, but",
friends may last a lifetime.,"During his convocation speech, Presi dent O'Brien warned us about the evils of rock music, particularly Pink Floyd's song, ""Another Brick in the Wall."" Of course, that song could be heard blasting out frosh windows only seconds after the assembly ended. O'Brien's critique of rock music was ob viously derived from a recent issue of Roll? ing Stone and was not particularly well received. However, his encouragement that a student be both socially-minded and scholarly is pertinent to every collegian. There was the one freshman who remarked, ""This place would be excellent if it weren't for classes. You know, if it could be like a summer camp where you drink beer, play frisbee and have a good time."" Yet certainly most freshmen realize that it will take some effort to suc ceed at Bucknell. Throughout the first week, freshmen experimented with their new freedom and rocked the dorms. Then Friday's start of classes brought respon sibility to temper the freedom. Even the hard-core partiers of 4th Trax began stu dying. The second half of the President's con vocation advice also applied. No matter how grade-minded you are, an important part of college is making friends. In ten years, your grade on a history paper will be forgotten, but friends may last a lifetime Most freshmen have been open and eager to get to know one another, and the parties certainly haven't hurt. All in all, this first week has brought freedom and responsibility, departure and arrival and, already, a lot of memories."

Her paintings have been displayed nationally and her works have been purchased by a number of corporations and museums. The exhibition, titled "" Blue i Paintings,"" consists of depictions of mountain snow scenes in muted acrylic hues of reddish brown, tan, blue, gray and pur ple. Also being displayed in the Bertrand Library are four draw ings by the artist with similar themes."

"Open Weekdays 8:30-5:00,",
Saturdays 10:00-2:00,"To create the realism in her works, Burko uses her own original slides of mountain ranges throughout the world, pro jecting them onto her studio wall. From these beginnings she con tinues with a unique process of tracing with pencil those aspects of nature which will be included in each particluar work, fre quently departing from the original elements of her photographs. Her technique con veys a serious respect for the remote vastness of the moun tains. Burko originally gained notoriety with the presentation of a series done in the same style and technique as "" Blue Paint ings"" but based on the Grand Canyon in Arizona. In a recent interview with the Philadelphia Inquirer Sunday Magazine, Burko said of her style "" I'm playing with facts, I'm not reporting fact."
I,"often play around with the sequence of slides. I alter everything for the sake of the picture. "" As I work, the ideas come. It's spontaneous and intuitive. What people should see is aesthetic relationships, abstract relation ships that go beyond description to what art is all about,"" she said. Burko will be lecturing on her work September 22 at 2 p.m. in the University Center Forum. Her exhibit will remain on the Bucknell campus until Sep tember 29."

'AirplaneV comedic,
spoof of melodrama,"By BRUCE BOWEN What do you get when you cross a number of serious actors with a script of total satire? The answer is Airplane!> a quite successful and thoroughly joyous comedy which has the potential to become a standard for which future films in the genre will aim. Airplane!, which opens tonight at the Campus Theatre on Market Street, has been hailed by many as a high quality comedy, in the same category as classics like Animal House and the Pink Pan ther and Monty Python series. Never before, though, has there been any real attempt at creating a parody on the disaster movie, so common in the past ten years. Airplane! has successfully done just that: spoof the disaster movie, and it did against several summer ""blockbuster"" movies, even as a low budget film. Based on the 1950's classic Zero Hour, and incorporating bits from the Airport-type disaster movies of the 1970's with a dash of Saturday Night Fever, Airplane! transforms these films' attempts at serious drama into some of the best spoof to hit the screen since Woody Allen began making serious movies. Probably Airplane !'s most suc cessful move was in the casting itself. Though the script itself is quite funny, seeing actors like Robert Stack, Lloyd Bridges, Peter Graves and Leslie Nielsen delivering these lines adds just that much more of a satirical im pact to the film. Jim Abrahams, David Zucker and Jerry Zucker of Kentucky Fried Movie fame wrote the screenplay and directed the film, and the fact that the final product is the result of several rewrites is a tribute not only to their perseverance with the project, but also to the refined quality of the film. Lead roles in Airplane! are left for two newcomers. Robert Hays comes fresh off a successful stint on the television series ""Angie,"" while Julie Hagerty comes to her role with veritably no acting ex perience at all. Hays portrays the World War II fighter pilot Ted Striker, who boards the plane on which his stewardess-lover Elaine, portrayed by Hagerty, is working. He ends up piloting the plane after a mysterious sickness afflicts the entire flight crew. Landing takes place only after we witness suicides of passengers listening to Striker's life story, a"

In fact, there is barely a spot in the movie which is not a parody of something, and so much is packed into the show that many funny lines are overlooked or simply lost in the shuffle. This haphazard situation is by no means ideal, but it is tolerable. Another problem with the film is that the scenes outside of the main plot taking place inside the airplane or control tower -- especially Striker's life story -- are quite dull, and the vague at tempts at humor in these seg ments seem rather contrived. But maybe that is part of the writer's aim. Airplane! is by no means perfect. The slow spots and overabundance of parody mar its polish, but still it remains an in credibly well done comedy and quite a good show, well worth see ing."

Union Station opens in town:,
'Quality food for low prices',"By TODD G. BUCHHOLZ For those who are tired of the same old choice between ham burgers and pizza, the Union Sta tion restaurant on Market Street brings refreshing variety to Lewisburg dining. Two weeks old, the Union Sta tion serves tacos, burritos, subs and roast beef sandwiches in an informal setting. The decor uses a train motif, with counters resembling ticket booths and menus hung like railroad schedules. Generous portions of fresh roast beef can be found on the "" Chicago Express Line."" Served on a toasted sesame bun, the Beefer ($1.59) and its variations - the Cheefer ($1.69, with cheese), the Leefer ($1.69, with lettuce, tomato and onion), and the Cleefer ($1.74, with cheese, lettuce, tomato and onion) -- make filling and tasty meals that"

Although one taco does not provide a full meal, the 63 cent price makes it reasonable. Burritos are also on the Ti juana schedule. The ingredients are similar to those of the tacos but lacking the bite of the taco sauce. They are served in a soft, thin shell; some may identify them as Mexican egg rolls. The burrito is also not enough for a meal and the 99-cent price, although low, is less reasonable than that of the tacos. The taco is recommended for those with more spirited taste buds as well as more limited budgets. There is also a garden burrito offered that is made with vegetables instead of the usual chopped beef. A wide variety of subs is of fered on the "" Long Island Ex press"" ranging from simple cheese ($1.49) through mixed meats ($1.99) to hot roast beef ($2.99). Their substantial size and the quality of their fillings make them good bets for the hungry but financially disadvantaged col lege student. Youthful owners Jeff Breed, a local businessman, and Paul Miller, a 1978 graduate of Bucknell, plan to offer a new line"

Special interest houses constitute a branch of residential Ufe that provides communal Uving and an alternative to dor- mitory Ufe. Ideally, the residents of these houses should share a common interest and should strive to promote and develop that interest by making use of the housing facilities. , , The Hulley House group, led by Marty Weiland '82, residential assistant and founder of the organization, is anxious to put this theory into action. Plans for the coming year include a fiddler's contest, a folk festival in the spring, student art ex hibits, poetry readings, concerts and criti que sessions of various artistic events tak ing place on campus. Another goal of the creative arts house is to host members of the newly reorganized Performing Arts Series in a number of in formal group discussions and open rehear- sdls, Weiland beUeves that such events will enable students to meet prominent artists on a more personal level than is normally available. The first of these happenings oc curs at 1:15 p.m. Sunday, with an open rehearsal of the visiting FitzwiUiam String Quartet. . ... .. Aside from planned activities, the creative arts house residents hope that their building will serve as an artistic watering-hole where impromptu jam ses sions can occur more freely than in the at mosphere of the average donmtory.

Soccer seeks extra effort for a winning season,"By ARTHUR BROCKWAY The soccer team returns for its 1980 season with an experienced look and a solid lineup, with only two questions looming large for Coach Craig Reynolds' charges. The first is a familiar one and the second more fundamental. Who will fill the goalie slot? Can they win the close match? Reviewing last season, a 6-7-1 effort, Reynolds recalls, "" We were in a lot of close games. Often, there was just a failure to take advantage of opponents' mistakes.""  The coach's words of frustration ring true as last fall's campaign witnessed the hooters losing all but one of its games by a single goal. Reynolds also cites the toughest week of the season, when the Bisons threw a scare in to national semifinalist Penn State before succumbing 2-1, and then travelled to Rider, losing 3-2 in overtime. Bucknell went into the week 5-2, and went into a tailspin, not winning again until the final game of the season against Lehigh. The problem of finding a con sistent goalkeeper has been around for the last three years. Senior Pete Puccia and junior Paul Green have been in a cons tant battle for the netminder's rights, and two years ago alter nated halves the whole season. Last year Puccia won the start ing honors halfway through the season, but not until Green had played three full games. Reynolds is again faced with a decision. "" Green has improved over the summer,""  he com mented of the former high school all-stater from New Jersey. "" It will just be a matter of who clicks better with the backs."" The final assignment will prob ably not come until somewhere in the middle of the season, with the keepers once again alternating games until then. Reynolds is particularly ex cited about his forward line. Returning to the attack will be juniors Brian Hassinger and Pat Christ, and sophomores Paul Devlin and Duncan Lee. Devlin will be moving up from a midfield position and is expected to add power to the striker slot. Joining these veterans will be frosh Pete Mullany. Mullany could find himself a starting posi tion on the front line or at the squad, Andy Sayles. Both Rotelli and Krupka, however, have started since freshman year, and Brotherton proved to be a potent scoring threat last year in his rookie term. The backfield bears the mark the fortunes of the soccer squad this year. The backfield is not particularly deep, and several players are just coming off minor twists and sprains. Reynolds feels that he will have to keep his men healthy for success. This has not been an easy task during the last three seasons, all of them Wm"

AFC forecast: no surprises,"By BOB DAVIS and JEFF CROSS ,With the 1980 National Football League season already one week old, we will lay our necks on the line by predicting both the regular and post-season out comes of the 16-week schedule, beginning with this week's play by play of the AFC. AFC EAST A question mark in New England is whether the aging defense can hold the leads the of fense should provide. Steve Grogan, one of the most mobile quarterbacks in the game, will call his own plays and throw often to clutch tight end Russ Francis and big-play receiver Harold Jackson as the Patriots march to the divisional title. Don Shula's well prepared Miami Dolphins should challenge New England for the top spot. With a solid young defense and a potentially explosive offense led by deep threats Freddie Soloman and Nat Moore plus flashy runner Delvin Williams, the Dolphins will be a definite playoff con tender. The New York Jets' problem is whether the defense can hold the opposition to under 30 points per game. With the addition of rookie speedster Johnny "" Lam""  Jones, the Jets'already potent offense can only get better. A healthy Bert Jones is the key to a successful season in Baltimore. All purpose runner Joe Washington and rookie Curtis Dickey give the Colts a respec table running game. When O.J. Simpson left for the sunny skies of California, Buffalo imported former Los Angeles coach Chuck Knox to brighten the Bills' fortunes. But don't look for them in the playoffs this year. AFCCENTRAL The four-time Super Bowl champion Pittsburgh Steelers have more talent than they can use. Joe Greene says "" One for the thumb in '81."" We'll be surprised if he's wrong. In any other division, Bum Phillips' Houston Oilers would be odds-on favorites for the crown. Newcomer Kenny Stabler joins .>> & i  : V << ' *, ip*"

AFC WEST The only time San Diego puts the ball on the ground is between plays. The addition of John Cap pelletti could help give the Chargers a running attack to match the aerial barrage of Dan Fouts and company. The Charg ers quality defense will enable them to repeat as division champs. The Denver Broncos have final ly found a replacement for aged quarterback Craig Morton in ex- Jet Matt Robinson. The "" Orange Crush""  defense will keep Denver in the race. Seattle faces one of the toughest schedules in the NFL, making their playoff chances slim. The combination of Steve Zorn to Steve Largent continues to be the brightest aspect of the Seahawks' offense.

talent,"By DAVE KIRKPATRICK Led by senior co-captains Dave Richards and Rob Wagner, Coach Jeff Ranck's varsity golf team will open its fall 1980 season tomorrow at the West Point In vitational tournament. The Bisons posted a 5-1 dual meet record last spring and finished fourth in the East Coast Con ference tournament. One of the keys to last season's success was Richards, who established himself as one of the finest collegiate golfers in the East while posting the second best season average in Bucknell golf history. This summer, he continued his fine play by qualify ing for the prestigious Northeast Amateur and Eastern Amateur tournaments. Wagner is also coming off a solid season. His continued im provement and leadership will benefit the Bisons. Rick Kramer '83, who came to Bucknell last year as one of the most highly touted players in the school's history, is expected to contribute greatly. The former Pennsylvania high school golf champion got off to a slow start last year but seems to be making the adjustment to the college game. Returning lettermen on the deep roster are juniors Kevin High, Mike Stoyla and Rob M c F a r l a n d as w e l l as sophomores Bill Frances and Corey Temple. Absent from the Bucknell lineup are junior regulars Jeff Buley and Kevin Forrest who are spending the semester abroad. Peter Orr, Todd Rankin, Bill Hagan and Michael Stelljes are promising freshmen from an outstanding recruiting season. Ranck is optimistic about Bison fortunes, stating that "" the team has good balance and outstanding talent."" Increased major tournament exposure will benefit the Bisons in their quest for another winning oircuiuuK m e scm csiei auruau. season !!jlllllllllllllllllllllllfllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllljUIIIIIIIIIIIHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIHIIIIIUlHf'K;"

McEnroe started fast against the sluggish Borg and held off the Swede's late surge to capture the four hour match, avengmg his defeat by Borg in the Wimbledon finals in July.

Field hockey outlook is bright,"By BILL BURKE The varsity field hockey team opened its 1980 season yesterday and was dealt a 6-0 defeat by powerful Penn State at State College. The Bisons played a respectable game against the Lions, who are ranked second nationally in Division I. "" We worked well as a unit,""  com mented co-captain Anne Kennedy '82, "" but it was like playing against professionals."" Coming off a 10-5-2 season and a seventh rank nationally in Divi sion II, the varsity field hockey team has a tough act to follow, but Coach Sally Starr feels the Bisons have the potential to finish even higher. In last weekend's pre-season tournament at Franklin and Mar shall College, the squad played competitively against Division I powers Penn, Temple and Lock Haven, as well as a tough Franklin and Marshall team. Starr stated that the team will be very young, having lost five starters to graduation. Starr stressed that "" a lot depends on how fast the players mature against tough competition."" Four members of a strong freshman class will be in the star ting lineup. Nancy Dill, Sue Lenker and Becky Bittinger have earned forward spots while Nan cy Williams will help to anchor the defense. "" The defense should be very strong,"" according to Starr. Se cond year starter Betsy Doyle '82 is in goal, with Jill Henry, the loan senior starter, at sweeper. Henry and Doyle were standouts on the varsity softball team last spring. The starting midfielders are Kennedy and Jeanne Minahan '83. Starr feels that "" the players are strong but it is necessary that they jell as a team."""
Bisons set for opener at UConn,"FOOTBALL, from page 24 up both positions is the versatile Marty Schaetzle '83. Anchoring the Bison offensive line is senior center Scott Taylor, who for the last two years backed up ECAC I-AA all-star Jim Tomeo. The only returning starter in the offensive backfield is left halfback Kenny Jenkins '82 who led the team in rushing and scor ing last season. "" He's a better ball player than he was last year,"" stated Curtis, "" and I look for him to rush for 1500 total of fensive yards."" Paired with Jenkins in the backfield is converted fullback Marshall Hall '83, a good blocker who is "" making the transition well."" Filling the slot at fullback is Geoff Gallo '82, "" who is quick and hits the hole well."" Gallo should be effective in short yardage situations. Daryl Cline '83 and Larry D'Amico '81 provide depth at the position. Calling the signals for the Herd this year will be sophomore quarterback A1 Locey, whose big gest asset is his emotional con trol. "" Locey can run well and he's very cool under pressure,""  com mented Curtis. The Bisons will have to effec tively execute the big play in order to have a successful cam paign. A margin of just six points separated Bucknell from an 8-2 record last season. Curtis noted, "" We have to pass more effectively and more often,"

Bison offense young;,
defense experienced,"By STEVEN SKOLNICK and MICHAEL SUAREZ It's a large wooden board with moveable name cards and it hangs on a wall in Head Coach Bob Curtis' office. It's the Bison football depth chart and, as daily line-up changes are recorded, the status of the team can be seen at a glance. The Herd is all here -- the starters, the stars, the promising, the unknown and at the bottom of the board, the injured. The suc cess of the Bisons will be measured by how many of those placards are able to remain at the top and how ably those in the middle can fill in should anyone fall to the bottom. In short, the Orange and Blue are big on talent and short on depth. The Bisons faced a similar situation last season on the way to a frustrating 4-4-2 record. The Herd got off to a strong 3-1-1 start highlighted by a two-point loss to powerful Rutgers, an un precedented victory over Cornell, and a shutout streak of 14 con secutive quarters. But when a series of injuries besieged the Herd in midseason, lack of depth left them able to win only one of their remaining five games. The Bison defense is a modified 4-4 which frequently shifts, mak ing an opponent's blocking assignments more difficult to ex ecute. Both the front four and the linebackers key well against the run, while an experienced secon dary should limit the success of their opponent's passing attack. Curtis com mented, "" The defense can be a good one but I'm afraid of an injury to this unit at any position."" Heading up the defensive front are returning senior starters Bruce Keltie, Dave Mann, Pete Mauritz and Dave Hibbard. Tri captains Hibbard and Keltie are among the most experienced players on the team and will pro vide an unparalleled combination at the defensive end positions. Although the defensive line is one of the most talented areas of the team, the availability of ex perienced back-up personnel is "" very, very sparse,""  according to Curtis. Starting at the middle line backer positions are veterans Alvin Depew '81 and Pat Paro '82. Returning as the strong side linebacker is tri-captain Joe Catalano'81. Playing opposite him on the weak side will be Jeff Miller '82. Mike Knaub '82 is returning following an injury last year to provide a strong backup at linebacker. Despite the recent loss to injury of defensive back Mike Carswell"
Ken Jenkins '82 displays the form that earned him ECAC division l-AA rookie of the,
week honors in the 1979 home opener against Dayton. Jenkins is expected to be the,
Bison's offensive workhorse this season.,"'81, the defensive secondary re mains one of the most capable areas on the team. Returning with valuable starting experience are safety Jim Gush '81 and backs McKinley Norris '81 and Doug Smoot '82. On offense, the Herd will con tinue to run its attack out of the versatile Wing-T formation. Cur tis believes this formation both "" maximizes ball control""  and "" reduces mistakes."" Lots of motion in the backfield should give opposing linebackers plenty of trouble. Look for a strong option to the right, quick misdirection plays and a more potent aerial attack."
Harriers aiming for record sixth title,By
JEFF CROSS,"Coming off two consecutive 17th place finishes in the NCAA national championships, the men's varsity cross country team expects another outstanding season. Coach Art Gulden's har riers are favored to win a record sixth straight East Coast Con ference title, but will face strong challenges from St. Joseph's and Lehigh. The squad also seeks to retain one of five NCAA qualifying berths from the eastern region as they shoot to improve on their 17th ranking nationally. Bucknell will put its 65-meet undefeated streak on the line tomorrow in a season-opening home meet against a strong Col umbia squad. Gulden rates Columbia "" a definite threat to our streak,"" J p^o12_o o ve Folsom"
John Eichenberg '81. Tom Richardson '84. Gene Foley '82 and,
Jeff Hines '84 sweat through a grueling pre-season workout.,
"The talented harriers, ranked 17th nationally last season,",
meet Columbia at home tomorrow.,"palling the Lions "" one of the seven best teams in the East."" Last year, Columbia won the Heptagonal championships, outracing all of the Ivy League universities as well as Army and Navy. With six of the top seven run ners returning and a strong freshman group, the Bisons will have depth once again. Leading the squad are tri-captains Jim O'Shea '81, Mike Debraggio '81 and Rick Sayre'82. O'Shea, noting that ""there are about ten runners within the same ability category,""  predicts a higher finish than last year. Sayre feels that Bucknell's early season training has gone very well and adds, "" the squad is aim ing for top ten in the NCAA's."" Despite relatively poor times by the more experienced varsity runners in a recent 5,000 meter time trial, Gulden cautions that the race was not a determinant of standings on the varsity squad. The coach attributes the disap pointing times to a "" lack of incen tive,""  but added that juniors Steve Bigotto and Doug Pickell, as well as most of the freshman runners, nonetheless turned in strong performances. Sayre reassures that Bucknell will be well prepared to race against Columbia on its way to another banner campaign. For the first time in recent memory the Bisons have a core of fine receivers. Heading up the list is tight end Rich Passerotti '82 who last year was converted from a linebacking spot. Passerotti surprised his doctors and coaches by coming back from serious knee surgery in the spring. Although few thought he would see action this season, Cur tis claims "" he's 100 percent right now."" In a move that surprised many people, the Bucknell coaching staff has named a freshman, Dave Kucera, as the starting split end. "" It's a big adjustment for a freshman to step onto the varsity field but we feel the ability is there,"" commented Curtis. Kucera's speed and excellent hands give the Bisons a genuine deep threat. Added strength will be gained on the right side of the offensive line by the return of starting tackle Mike McDonald '80 who was granted an additional year of eligibility because he missed the 1978 season with a fractured leg. McDonald is big, strong and has the capability to play tight end, giving Bucknell the option to use a double tight end offense in short-yardage situations. Splitting left tackle duties will be juniors John Boehmer and Joe Golomboski. The senior tandem of Al Wehrhahn and Darren Ford will lead the way for Bison runners at right and left guard, respective ly- "" Wehrhahn is as capable as any guard we've had in the Wing-T,"" commented Curtis. Returning starter Ford has been described by Curtis as "" a fine blocker on the move.""  Backing See FOOTBALL, page 23 Photo--Tim Hoying"

Solar club builds,
aquaculture at mod,"BylOE NW OLCKENHAU ER "" The aquaculture]"
-I,"T**i Amiaculture, a science bei t5 y  IAE j I x ------ Aquaculture, a science being pioneered by the Solar Club, will soon be producing high protein fish and vegetable fertilizers in a University modular unit. The solar mod, with its attached greenhouse, was the location chosen by the club to build a six foot deep aquarium-type pond which can serve as a controlled breeding environment for some 250 fish totally free from chemical fertilizers, electrical power, and live feed. Bob Dorns '81, one of the primary builders, is doing his senior honor thesis with informa tion he collects from the project. He cited four functions of the aquaculture project: 1) low| cost food production; 2) utilizing nutrients from the water in the pond for plants; 3) storing heat collected during the dayfor 5degdeg(tm) temperature control; ?nd 4) a esth etic p lea su re of the arAPnhOUSC. "" The aquaculture system, said ABS P re s id e n t John Dzurinko, '81, "" was designed in the same light as was the entire solar mod project--to provide an example of how food can be grown in a small area. He said the process actually models an entire ecosystem in a simple way, virtually unaffected by anything in the outside en vironment except the energized rays of the sun. Dzurinko also stressed the size and simplicity of the experiment. Although technology will soon be able to Improve the model, this project demonstrates a "" real life experience"" for people to see a home where energy and food could be produced to sustam itself. . . . ,, ,, The costs of the project, ac cording to Dorns, << e r e  "" about $500 to build, not including the hundred hours or so of labor that went into it."" - AQUACULTURE, Page 5 This qualification which ex empts events "" sanctioned by the University""  from this n d fis th e loophole through wluch beer is permitted to be served at the an nual graduation tent P3^ Greek Week is not a Umversi ty sanctioned"" event, Commer- ford said, and alcoholic consmnp- tion is therefore restricted to the properties of privately owned fraternities.

"" Enforcement is still"
m,"the hands of local police for out of doors on the campus,""  he said. The University's stricter en forcement of its alcohoUc con sumption poUcy is seen as an ef- fort to promote responsible drink ing while limiting its liability.

Delaware VaUey was found neeUgent and Uable in the injury and subsequent quadraplegic paralysis of a student which oc- cured after a school-sponsored ^ This court decision prompted many Pennsylvania coUeges, in cluding BuckneU, to reassess their student drinking pohcies, Commerford said.

O'Brien subject of trustee's,
inquiry after four years here,"By DAVID HAWKINGS At the request of University President Dennis O'Brien, an ad hoc committee of the Universi ty's board of trustees this year will conduct a "" review and assessment"" of O'Brien's first five years here. The trustees' Committee on Presidential Assessment has already begun work on the report they will deliver to the biannual meeting of the board here next May. Samuel H. Woolley, vice chair man of the board and chairman of the assessment, said "" Nobody on the board has any concerns about O'Brien""  when reached for comment Thursday night. O'Brien -- who will be the first of Bucknell's 12 presidents to undergo a formal evaluation -- asked when he was appointed president in 1976 that a report on his job performance be issued at the end of his fifth year. He reiterated this request at the board's meeting last spring. Woolley said the committee has had but one preliminary meeting and that no format for the evalua tion had yet been set. "" We don't know yet what we will be looking for,""  he said, add ing that he "" guessed"" part of the report would include interviews with members of the student body, faculty and administration. A progress report is scheduled to be delivered to the board's ex ecutive committee in March. O'Brien said this week that reviews of the type he asked for when accepted the job of presi dent are a "" healthy way of strengthening the office."" He said he had "" no idea""  of what form the trustee's in vestigation would take. College president assessments of this type -- which have become common elsewhere recently -- are an offspring of increased "" concern about executive ac countability,"" O'Brien said. The president is directly ac countable only to the board of trustees, and serves "" at their pleasure,"" University policy states. O'Brien said he was not wor ried the committee would give the board an unfavorable "" report card,"" and he said he plans to ask for another assessment in 1986, the year he would enter his 10th year here. He said he has "" no plans"" to retire. Besides Woolley, the four- member group appointed by trustee Chairman Charles Baird in May consists of Andrew Mathieson of Pittsburgh, Claire Carlson of New York City and Uiversity of Chicago English Pro fessor Robert Streeter. None of the trustees has ever served on a presidential assess ment committee before, Woolley said. .mm"

A revamping of the phone system here will make it unnecessary to place long-distance phone,

Phone system renovations planned,"By NANCY McMANUS A new phone system which will enable students to dial direct long distance phone calls from their rooms will be installed within a year, according to Gerald Commerford, associate director of residen tial life. The new system will enable students to place off- campus calls without going through the University switchboard. Security measures may be necessary to prevent unauthorized use of the phones for long distance calls. Locks may be installed on the phones, requir ing students to unlock the phone before use. Phone bills would be issued separately through the University and sent to each room. 1 8 AE d /"

"Tom Travis, professor of political science, speaks Thursday",

Palestinian conflict and on other Middle East problems.,
Travis says Palestine,
key to Mideast peace,"By STEVE GARFINKEL A Palestinian nation must have statehood and self-determination to achieve lasting peace in the Middle East, Associate Professor of Political Science Tom Travis told a meeting of the International Relations club in the University Center Forum Thursday night. Travis depicted in detail two scenarios -- one "" static""  and one "" dynamic""  -- that portrayed the future of the Mideast. The static scenario would be one in which Egyptian President An war Sadat would be snared in "" an Israeli trap"" that confines him to waiting at the feet of the Israelis. t . Anwar Sadat has a tremendous ego and he wants all of the Sinai Peninsula back. If he threatens Israel, he won't reach lus! goal, Travis said. Sadat, according to Travis, would probably be ousted as Egypt's leader by the military without taking this stance. The dynamic scenario detailed the coexistence of a Palestinian state with Israel by the election of labor leaders who would replace the "" hard line"" government of Israel. . A five-year period would exist during which time a Palestinian state would be "" tried out""  by Israel, in Travis' plan. This dynamic situation would result in a strong Israeli-Egyptian peace, the reaching of United States goals and -  most importantly -  no war in the Mideast, Travis said. "" Both Sadat and the United States must choose, he said, bet ween which approach is right to take. A new war would include the possible use of nuclear weapons, the failure of U.S. diplomacy and a possible split in the NATO alliance, according to Travis. Travis listed six reasons for the "" limited"" Israeli position in the Palestinian matter. Because of violence, he said, many Palesti nians are unwilling to negotiate with the Israelis. Jordan and Syria still do not condone the Camp David Accords, and as a result Egypt is ostracized in the world. . Travis said the Palestinian quest for statehood has been legitimized by the recent UN condemnation of Israel. The Euro pean Common Market has also taken a stance on a "" new European initiative"" to restart the stalled peace talks, Travis told the au dience of 30. , .. # The U.S.-Israeli stance has united the Arab nations more than before against Israel, he concluded. Travis listed five "" conditions of stability' that would not allow a "" super conflict"" to occur in the Mideast. The United Nations en forcement action to back up its resolutions against Israel, Travis said, is not likely to occur. He added that America is unhkely to press Israel to give concessions to the Palestine Liberation Organization because Israel is a U.S. ally.________________________"
Student leaders convene for a,
Table' talk,". nntciHp the riculum"" for the University, and By DAVID HAWKINGS ABS President John Dzurinko '81 this week called together the leaders of major student organizations in an effort to "" coor dinate and consolidate"" their efforts behind the major goals of his administra- tion. In what Dzurinko termed a "" roundtable discussion"" Tuesday evening, the ABS principal officer told the others "" We have the resources and the knowledge behind us, but we're letting them escape."" "" When we're isolated from each others as leaders, we're defeating ourselves,"" Dzurinko said. "" If we know we can go to each other for support and help, we can get things done."" The seven others attending the dinner meeting appeared responsive to Dzurinko's urging that the efforts of the major extracurricular activities be strengthened through unity, but they all balked at the president's suggestion that major extracurricular efforts especially if they improved the life of the surrounding community of Lewisburg -  be more easily rewarded by academic course credit. Although WVBU-FM Program Director Jay Cresswell '81 asserted that "" If we all had course credit for the time we put in on activities, we would all have graduated years ago,""  he joined with the others in telling Dzurinko that efforts outside the classroom should be separated from academic endeavors in most situations. Others who participated in the meeting were Bucknell Student Lectureship Chair man and former ABS President Phil An drews '81, Bucknell Engineer Editor David Christiansen '81, Concern and Action President Steve Hushner '82, Interfrater nity Council President Steve Kohn 81 Eco- Coalition Chairman Scott Bolhack '81 and an editorial board member of the Bucknellian. One of Dzurinko's primary goals as president of the ABS is to develop what he calls "" a more socially oriented cur riculum"" for the University, and he tried to sell his ideas to the group at the meeting. There was a general consensus among the seven others in attendance that faculty should be encouraged to offer courses which integrated material with the needs of the community. Dzurinko plans to convene the group weekly for an indefinite period of time, but he said he plans to invite other student leaders -- from groups such as the Black Student Alliance, the Women's Concern , the Panhellenic Council and the principal religious organizations Group three here -- to all future meetings."

Thomas: The controversy is history,"____ j a>>ai with it again, but broke her By MATT KARANIAN"
"""Where","the hell is Bucknell? It's an overused phrase, but it was probably the first reaction of Linda Thomas, visiting assistant instructor of political science, when she responded to a Univer sity advertisement for a position here. .. Thomas is filling a vacancy m the comparative politics division of the political science depart ment. The temporary opening was created when Professor Harry Blair left on sabbatical last semester. Last year, the position of visiting professor was filled by Stuart Rothenberg, an interna tional politics specialist. His one year contract with the University expired last May. rolled in squash, swimming and dance classes, and before school began, she ran daily. ""Now there's no time,"" she says laconically. Thomas does not consider herself ""politically active,"" however. ""Many have the im pression that I'm a Radical Black Nationalist, but this is not the case,"" she said. ""I'm not an 'ideological person'."" Thomas said even her friends ""can't tell you what my leanings are. She isn't sure who she will sup port for president yet, and she was unsure how to label herself politically. ""Who says political science professors should be ideologically anything?"" Claims have been made in the past--including an assertion last"
NEWSMAKERS,"Thomas' agreement calls for her to serve here for two years. Thomas said she ""had never heard of Bucknell"" before apply ing here. Upon checking the U niversity's credentials, however, she said she found it to be a ""very good school. But, because ""this is the East, not the South,"" she has ex perienced ""a little cultural shock,"" and is only ""vaguely looking forward to living in a smalltown."" . Thomas, who grew up in Loui siana, said she has never been this far east before. And although her hometown was small, it was only 15 miles outside Baton Rouge, giving her the advantage of living in both a small town and being near a city. Everything cultural here, she said, seems to revolve around the University. Thomas considers herseit somewhat "" athletically in clined,"" and active. She is en- year by Rothenberg--that the political science department here is leftist. The department has been called unbalanced ideologically, and has been refer red to as composed of ""collec tivists."" Thomas shrugs off these claims, however. ""At Bucknell, anybody is leftist. Center here is not the normal center."" For Buckndll, the ideological center is actually far to the right, she said. , . . While refusing to explain where she stood ideologically, she said that either extreme, whether rightist or leftist, is a reflection of narrow-mindedness. Rightists and leftists are usually ""not will ing to deal with opinions opposite to theirs."" Drawing her conclusion from dealings with reporters last semester, Thomas said she believed the Bucknellian is an ultra-conservative newspaper. She said she had vowed never to"

Having been reared in the South, however, Thomas said her first exposures to conservatives, and her first impressions of them, are men in ""white robes and burning crosses. But although she equates conser vatism with the racism of the Ku Klux Klan in the South, she claims that the conservatives in the northern United States are such mainly because of their socio-economic background. Thomas said conservatism among students was primarily a product of their predominantly upper-middle class upbringing. She said she has encountered no racism or sexism. Thomas is the first black woman on the faculty here, and is the only woman in her department. . _ , ,, Thomas arrived at Bucknell having received a lot of unwanted publicity. The competition to fill sabbatical-bound Blair's vacancy in the department was intense, and Rothenberg was among those competing with Thomas. Rothenberg claimed he was the only member of the political science department with a con servative ideology, and he therefore should be retained. His one year position had expired and was considered for renewal. When the position was offered to Thomas, Rothenberg told the Bucknellian, ""Although Thomas is a qualified candidate, there is a reasonable chance she (would not have been hired) had she not been a black woman."" Thomas doesn't think Rothen berg is correct. ""I am well qualified. I fit the bill for the job: comparative politics."" She said her applica tion never mentioned she was a black woman, because she ""didn't want it to."" She said last year's Rothenberg controversy, in which students wrote letters and circulated peti tions to persuade the University to hire him, is ""a problem for the University, not for me."" Although Thomas said ""Rothenberg might not have had a case if I wasn't a black woman,"" she has ""no feelings about what has passed. ""Students need some diversi-"

Reagan shot back at Carter when he and runningmate George Bush gathered for a rally on the Capitol steps with Republican Congressional can didates and party leaders Mon day. Reagan criticized the disunity of President Carter and his party and went on to outline some ma jor Republican goals at the rally.

Both Reagan and Anderson criticized Carter for his refusal to debate with them, but Carter termed it "" a Republican debate"" and restated that he would not be there. The president is willing to debate with Reagan but declined to participate in a session that in cluded Anderson. The debate, sponsored by the League of Women Voters, takes place in Baltimore and will begin at 10 p.m. Sunday. It will be televised by the CBS and NBC networks and will focus on domestic affairs, including the economy and national defense.

The figure above depicts the aquaculture which is now in operation at the solar mod here. The,
six-foot deep tank is used to produce food and fertilizer.,
High-protein fish raised at mod,"From AQUACULTURE, Page 1 The funds were primarily from the Solar Club, which receives appropriations from the ABS. Dorns is confident that the project will soon pay for itself in terms of BTU's in heat energy and edible food produced. The primary fish being bred is the tilapia, a Mid- Eastern fish known for its strong health and hear tiness as well as easy breeding qualities. Other benefits of the tilapia, which grows to be seven to twelve inches, are that it eats algae and does not eat any other fish, most importantly its young. In the two months of the experiment, not one of the fish has died, and 35 have grown to full adulthood. The technology for the project came from various sources, especially the acquired knowledge and research of the seven people who composed the team of builders. Many ideas came from an organization in Cape Cod, Mass, called the New Alchemists. This group is a progressive research group in the area of solar, wind and aqua technology. The system was described to the Bucknellian in an The third tank is a plant tank which helps to remove other matter from the water and to transfer nitrogen gas from the air to the water. In the main tank are surface plants called water hyacinth, fine rooted plants which clean dust and impurities off the water surface.

The tank, he explained, is designed to produce and stimulate the growth of large quantities of algae which is the primary source of food for the fish. Much of the waste and other undesirable materials settle to the bottom and are eated by catfish. A pump, which will eventually be powered by a windmill, circulates water through three sup plementary tanks. One tank simply collects sedi ment, which is used as fertilizer for plants.

Somoza cut-down,
by machine gun fire,"Anastasio Somoza Debayle, the ousted ruler of Nicaragua, died in a hail of machine-gun fire Wednesday in Asuncion, the capital of Paraguay. Somoza chose Paraguay as a safe place of exile last year. The 54-year-old Nicaraguan, whose family ruled his Central American nation from 1936 until he fled Sandinist guerrilla forces in July of last year, was struck by 25 machine-gun bullets. The five man Nicaraguan junta who presently rule the country deny having any association with Somoza's death. They never theless expressed joy at the news of his death. The United States supported Somoza's dictatorship, and he in turn acted as an American "" proconsul"" in Central America, interfering openly in the affairs of his neighbors to keep them op posed to Communism. Somoza was therefore puzzled when the Carter administration criticized violations of human rights in Nicaragua. Left-wing politicians hailed the assassination as a warning to all dictators. His assassination, however, may not end the Somoza fiefdom. His son is said to be eager to avenge the dynasty's collapse."
Saudis up oil prices,
to keep OPEC unity,"Saudi Arabia, the World's largest oil exporter; agreed to raise its oil price by $2 a barrel; to $30, yesterday. Saudi Arabia's deputy oil minister, said that the increase enables OPEC to "" reach a unified price.""  Saudi Arabia, which has repeatedly insisted that oil prices must be reduced, agreed to raise the price in return for a pledge by other OPEC members that their prices would be lowered even tually. The accord includes an agree ment that the Saudis, if they are satisfied with the moderation on prices by other OPEC members, would cut back their production by one million barrels a day next year, to 8.5 million barrels a day. Industry analysts say a $2-a- barrel increase by the Saudis would not have a noticeable im pact on the cost of petroleum pro ducts in the U.S., since the rise is less than five cents a gallon and since Saudi Arabis accounts for only about seven percent of the nations total oil supplies. The agreement, under which other members would freeze pre sent prices, was a last effort by the oil cartel to reach an accord before the summit meeting of all 13 OPEC chiefs of state in Bagdad, Iraq in November. The new accord will lift the price of one-third of OPEC's oil by $2 a barrel because the Saudis produce that much. OPEC's official price is $32 a barrel."

Shortages of nuke,
material high in US,"The Carter administration is facing the question of whether to increase production of bomb- grade plutonium at the same time the United States is discouraging foreign govern ments from acquiring stockpiles of such materials. The United States is not pro ducing enough plutonium and other bomb-grade substances to create a new generation of nuclear weapons over the next decade, the Defense and Energy Departments have concluded. Secretary of Defense Harold Brown has reported that existing stockpiles of bomb-grade materials are so low that delays have already occurred in some nuclear weapons programs. The growing shortage in plutonium and tritium, another nuclear-weapons material, has put pressure on President Carter to approve a plan for expanding American production of bomb- grade substances for the first time in more than 15 years. The administration, State Department and arms control aides say any decision to increase production would be viewed abroad as hypocritical. The House and Senate Armed Services Committee has inserted funds in the budget request for the fiscal year 1981 to increase plutonium production."

The new program is designed to win the votes of laid-off steelworkers. The dumping issue is crucial for President Carter in the steelmaking towns of Penn sylvania and Ohio. Recent polls have shown Republican presiden tial candidate Ronald Reagan slightly ahead in both states, which hold a total of 52 electoral votes. Imports have left more than 100,000 U.S. steelworkers idle, ac cording to David Roderick, chair man of U.S.""Steel Corp."

Last week the state Agriculture Department declared 11 counties, including Union, as drought disaster areas and began work ing with the federal government to have the entire state declared a disaster area. Although too late to help the summer crops, rain is needed to replenish well water supplies and to help the fall-planted winter wheat crop."
Newest sorority,
joins national base,"Delta Lamba Pi, a local sorori ty here, has become a national sorority. Its new name is Delta Phi Epsilon. Sorority president Kathy Olson '81 said nationalization will "" strengthen the sisterhood."" There will be no change in ac tivities or structure, but there will be a change in contact with other universities, and with alumni, Olson said. A member of the National Panhellenic Council, Delta Phi has no sorority suite in Hunt Hall now, but hopes to have one soon. The Delta Phi Epsilon chapter operating here is Phi Rho. It was established in 1978 and now has 14 members."

Commerford echoed this opi nion: ""Up until last year, we felt it was an adequate policy . . .  but after our talks of last year and the Delaware Valley incident, we felt it was imperative that we make some change in our stance."" Both Commerford and Dunlop expect the Residential Life staff to be the primary enforcers of the new policy. In prior years, resi dent assistants and residence directors were expected to supervise hall parties. The new policy is markedly dif ferent. 1 ..... ""Instead of staff availability, they need to interact with the students in a different way, to re mind them of the University's ex pectations,"" Commerford said. Thus far, Commerford and Dunlop report no serious pro- blems in implementing the new policy. Added Dunlop: ""We believe that the students will not put the R.A.'s in a position of jeopardy."" Among the R.A.'s, however, confusion is only now beginning to subside over the enforcement issue. One R.A. in Kress Hall described the policy as ""virtually impossible to enforce"" adding that ""we were pretty confused about how far we have to carry out this rule. A lot of R.A.'s were upset that we weren't notified sooner."" Dunlop said ""We mishandled that badly -  our lateness in in forming the R.A.'s of the new policy. I feel badly for our staff that they did not know this at the time they were offered the jobs."" A series of meetings between Commerford, Director of Residential Life Brenda Gordon and the Residential Life staff has,"
GERALD COMMERFORD,"in the last week, made progress in clarifying and amplifying the University's new position. ""So far, things have been con ducted as we hoped they would,' said Commerford in assessment of the new policy."
IFC to charge frosh,"The Intrafratemity Council voted Tuesday to institute a $2 registration fee for all men in terested in rushing fraternities. The primary reason for the new fee is to support IFC functions such as Greek Week, the Rush booklet, and publicity cam paigns, according to IFC Presi dent Steve Kohn'81. ""Costs for fraternity men have gotten extremely high, and we felt that a registration fee would be the best way to raise funds rather than increase IFC dues, ""Money is collected at other universities and by the Panhellenic Council here, Kohn said. Freshman girls who register are presently charged $ 1 . ""Freshmen are getting eight weeks of rush and a really good time, and two dollars isnt too much to ask,"" Kohn said. At a meeting held earlier this week, fraternity rush chairmen voted overwhelmingly not to charge the fee. ""It serves no necessary purpose that IFC dues cannot cover,"" one fraternity of ficer said. ""They could possibly discourage freshmen from giving fraternities a chance,"" he said. Formal rush will begin Sunday, and will continue through Mon day and Wednesday nights fo next week. For the second year in a row, freshmen will be required four to five houses on each evening. After Greek Weekend, Sept. 27-28, houses will be open for in formal rushing until pledging in early November."

LETTERS_______________________,
We're more anarchist than collectivist,"To the Editor: In last week's Bucknellian, Richard Pisano argued that ""collectivist professors had over run"" the economics and the political science departments. Dismally, Pisano ended his arti cle arguing that ""students, alum ni and especially trustees"" should pressure Dennis O'Brien to redress the ideological balance in these two departments. Such pleas for a grand equilibrium are often made con cerning social science depart ments, since, invariably, those who study American culture closely discover that parts of it stink to high-heaven. And, public discussion of the stench often pro vokes outsiders. For example, several corporations recently have funded over thirty ""chairs of free enterprise"" in the U.S. (including one at Stanford). The purpose of each of these chairs is to bring the ideology of free enterprise into the classroom to compete with that of the ima gined collectivists. Given his view, then, Pisano is part of an ongoing cacophonous choir, bear ing much sound and no small amount of fury. But, sweetly, universities have procedures which, though typically tedious, do not readily give in to such pressures exerted by those off campus and unin formed adequately to offer sage advice on personal matters. Specifically, adding faculty members, of any persuasion, to the economics department would involve a selection of a preferred candidate by the department (with counsel from our majors) to be presented to the administra tion, with a very strong likelihood that this choice would be ap proved. There is, in other words, very little left in this process for anyone else to do: we faculty and students, along with Ms. Ann Witkowski, are the economics department, and, as such, we know better (by a wide margin would be my guess) than anyone else who should join us as a col league. Fortunately, like most en cumbrances of this world, this one has its silvery side for Mr. Pisano. In fact, the economics department has already been decollectivized, and by its own past hiring practices. And, were Mr. Pisano aware of even the most superficial aspects of the way we Bucknell economists think about the economy, he would realize how foolish is his judgement that we are ""collec tivists"". As I read things, more of us would call ourselves anarchist than collectivist, and without question, most would not think of themselves as either of these. Finally, it is interesting to speculate about how the alumni, students and especially the trustees, now bothered by our political inclinations (if there are such people) would react to the utter decollectivism sometimes imagined by the anarchist, where everything, including large pro perty holdings, are fragmented entirely and shared widely. Charles Sakrey Assistant Professor of Economics"
Administraton playing games?,
In praise of,
Christy's Gate,"To the editor: The Bucknellian cannot see anything wrong with bringing in a ""Director of Security?"" Iam  incredulous! What is wrong is that the ad ministration is playing a chess game using Chief Fine and his assistants as pawns. A dual purpose is being served: 1. Fine is being made an example of to the other foreman. 2. Im provements won as a result of unionization will be credited to the reorganization of the new ""Director."" Our security depart ment already has men capable to reorganize. For years we have suggested this course of action, and our suggestions were re jected. Since our unionization, Mr. Zeller has decided that a B.A. degree is a requirement for the position of chief. An A.A. degree is to be required for future of ficers. All responsibilities that the new ""Director"" is to assume have in the past been carried out by people with a high school education. The East Buffalo and Lewisburg Police Departments are staffed by 11 trained officers. They are excellent men, but would not qualify as security of ficers under Mr. Zeller's plan. I have described the cir cumstances under which we work to professional police officers, and they usually laugh. Would they work under similar condi tions? No. Ask a professional if he thinks we should be trained, and he'll say ""of course."" Mr. Bell (he's an engineer) thinks it's a waste of time and money. He says we can go to the use of local police, and as an example he mentions tampering with fire apparatus. Ask Chief Heiter of Lewisburg if his officers will issue warnings to students or turn them over to the administration for action, the way campus security does. Rare ly or never will be the answer. Ask him if you can get a perma nent police record for tampering with fire apparatus. The answer is yes. Ask what happens if you are the victim of a crime and an untrained security officer makes a minor mistake on the case. The criminal goes free. In the Bucknellian, Chief Heiter mentions ""illegal han dguns on campus."" Ask for details. You will find that in this particular incident the local police received the call for assistance after the suspect arm ed with a .357 magnum handgun was apprehended by a security officer. We do not know the cir cumstances of a call until we get to the scene. We are required to answer police-type calls! There are hundreds of incident reports on file, and they prove this point. I simply point out that in over six years of protecting the people and property of Bucknell I have been bruised, scratched, bitten and cut, and I do not want to end up dead. The administration wants the appearance of a police force, but we only have the authority of watchmen. I think that it is very un fortunate that Mr. Bell and Mr. Zeller have become locked into a rigid anti-union position. We had hoped to enter a period of reasonable dialogue on the sub ject of security. Cp. E.J. Roberts Campus Security"

Nora Wilcox '81"
Homogenize,
the liberality,"To the Editor: Curricular reform is a win ding subject at Bucknell--the present effort is more than four years old. Teachers gather about to mete out their various concerns for the academic and intellectual world. It is, John Kennedy once said, an honorable preoc cupation. Unfortunately, radicals tend to seize the curricular agenda and work to incorporate per sonal ideology into what will eventually be issued. This describes the bombastic no tions of Messrs. John Kirkland, Douglas Sturm, Dennis O'Brien and Bob Chambers, who have each worked to homogenize the liberality which has made Bucknell a thriving, great in stitution. No person is free if he must think like another. Thus I kindly reject thematic cur riculum. Rather, curriculum, and I mean the best curriculum, must rely upon clean and pure structure to let it operate. In this way the vivid per sonalities of faculty may with freedom present their best and brightest ideas, and the recipients can struggle to develop from them their own guiding themes. Jim Wilson '82"

John Held,"I am running for freshman class president because I want to integrate the class as much as possible with extracurricular ac tivities. There are many people who still do not know each other and this can be cor rected. The intrigue of political machinery and the storm and stress of decision making do not bother me. I have followed politics closely most of my life and eventually I hope to enter United States politics and help guide the nation through the socio-economic turmoil of the 21st century. I am an avid debater; my op ponents always know my views. I feel I am qualified to evaluate vast quantities of in formation and from that distill a rational decision. The underlying premise of my platform is simple: I want to create a more integrated freshman class. In addition, life should be made as pleasant as possible for students while still maintaining Bucknell's reputation as a high quality institution. It is inap propriate to ask every student to be rabidly interested in politics so it is that much more important to secure responsible officials. Every political state in history has eventual ly fallen due to decayed administrations. I urge every student to explore the view points and political philosophies of the can didates thoroughly on Sunday at 8 p.m. in Roberts Lounge. I welcome debate or discus sion on any political topic with any in terested student or professor at any time. I especially urge all students to vote in the up coming election. The maintenance of political society can only be assured by peo ple, not institutional inertia."
"CANDIDATES FOR PRESIDENT, CLASS OF '84: From left, Dan",
"Huck, John Held and Michael Concordia.","starting official rush late in September adds to freshman restlessness. A solution to this lack of clarity in policy is a clearly stated position and procedure con cerning alcohol. As a solution or alternative to this new administration stand, we would support an earlier start for official freshman rush and designated "" legal""  areas on cam pus that could be rented to various groups or classes who want to have parties where alcohol will be served. ABS is attempting to integrate the Univer sity curriculum more closely with the ex tracurricular activities on campus this year, and we would help in any way to further this plan. In order to keep our community vibrant and multifaceted, there needs to be more administration financial and moral support for activities outside of the classroom.

"Paul Mihok, Scooter Hoerrnerand Nick Badami.",
Dan Huck,
Herb Grice,"The intent of our campaign is not to make empty promises that our own power limita tions, as freshman class officers, would not allow us to fulfill. However, there are serious problems and administrative deficiencies within the University community that we recognize and would attmept to modify. Foremost among our concerns are the new policy limitations on alcoholic beverages and their consumption. We do not advocate breaking Penn sylvania drinking laws, but we also feel the University administration is not dealing with the problem clearly or realistically. Damage to freshman dorms is an issue in itself and is not strictly a result of hall parties. Likewise,"
Vice-President,
Nick Badami,"Let me tell you, unexpressable, yet com mon to us all, is the feeling I got when Dad turned and left me standing alone in front of a strange-looklng building called the Univer sity Center. The first contact I had was with two upperclassmen who handed me a folder with my name, Nicholas Badami, on it. I told them to call me ""Nick."" So began by first day as a freshman. I arrived at Freshman Camp and was deposited amidst other ap prehensive persons. As these strangers became individuals through various "" ac tivities""  I became aware of the extraor dinary friendliness and enthusiasm we shared. Friends came naturally and surpris ingly fast. The freshmen at the camp con sidered themselves special in that we had such tremendous spirit and fellowship. When I arrived at campus, however, I realized that we were not special, rather the entire Class of 1984 is special. That is when I decided that I would like to have the honor of representing such a fine class. It is true that we are all freshmen, but that Is something to be proud of! We are all beginning again, so let's start off on the right foot with class of ficers that have the initiative and drive to get things done because a step In the right direc tion will always bring us closer to our goals. We need not look forward to the years ahead when we are juniors or seniors. We have something the juniors and seniors don't have: time. Time to make the Class of 1984 the best in Bucknell's history. These next tour years of our lives will be the most trying yet the most enjoyable. Elect me to the posi tion of vice-presidency and I will do my very utmost to make our class one to be proud of."
Scooter Hoerrner,"I am running for vice president of the Class of 1984 for three basic reasons, all of which mean a great deal to me. My first reason for running is the sense of ac complishment I get from seeing things done right. Being vice president would give me the opportunity to blend my ideas with those of the other students to create the best possi ble plans. Another reason I have for seeking office is because of the enjoyment I get from working with people. This summer I had a job which let me work closely with people and I found that I really enjoyed it. By being vice presi dent, I would get a chance to work with other freshmen and also alumni and I know it would be something that 1 would enjoy. A third reason for my campaigning is school pride. I have been here only two weeks but already I can sense a strong feel ing of school spirit and tradition. Bucknell is a school long in tradition and by being vice president I would try my utmost to carry on this tradition of achievement. Putting it into one line, I would say the vice presidency is a job I want to do, a job I know I could do, and a job I hope, you the Class of 1984, will let me do."
Paul Mihok,"As a vice-presidential candidate I realize I will not be making any earth-shattering deci sions. However, I do notice areas where im provements can be made. The telephone lines out of town could be increased to allow more people a chance to call home. Too many times it takes too long to reach your family. Also, an increase in the allocation of freshman shower hot water would be helpful. My third and final reason for running is sim ple. Student government is the initial step a person must take in order to enter major U.S. politics. For years the power of change has rested in the hands of the students. This power, however, had been useless because it has been spread out and diverse. It must be concentrated in order to be effective. To in fluence legislation the students must channel their energies into one focal point. I can be that focal point. The students can no longer be content to let others run their lives. It is now time for students to influence their own destinies."
Thomas Burke,"Strong, responsible officers, able and will ing to represent as well as unify the Class of 1984, are necessary for a successful freshman year both academically and socially. I am running for secretary/ treasurer because I am sure that I can make a positive contribution to our class. It is my intention to bring our class together with many diverse activities and fund raisers. One idea I would like to see put into action is a counseling service for students having difficulties with any of their courses. Such a service would be run like the ride sheet system in the University Center. Also, study breaks would be a beneficial activity for many students. These small get togethers would ease the tension before exams. People with ideas for class activities should be able to contribute them to the officers for con sideration. I have considerable experience with the duties of a treasurer, having been the treasurer of an American Field Service chapter. I am majoring in accounting, work ing toward a Bachelor of Science degree in business administration and I plan to become a Certified Public Accountant. I would really like to pull our class together and get started on a great year. If we all par ticipate, I am sure that our class will have an outstanding first year at Bucknell."
Treva O'Leary,
Kress,
_____,
Steve Garfinkel,"As a candidate, 1 am genuinely concerned with what occurs at Bucknell. In any class or organization, there are those apathetic in dividuals who choose not to participate; I do not choose that path. In my later high school years, I realized that activities, especially student government, provide challenges and obstacles that make life exciting. Through the office of secretary/treasurer and the assumption of the subsequent responsibility which it brings, I may provide myself with this type of challenge. Through meeting this challenge, I can pro vide not only myself, but the Class of 1984 with a sense of accomplishment and achieve ment. Meeting a goal in a successful manner is difficult. I, with your support, can reach the goal of being elected to the office of secretary/treasurer. Campaign articles, many times, can sound misleading. The following demonstrates why I want this office and why I feel that I am competent for the job. I sense that 1 am relatively representative of the type of stu dent who attends Bucknell. I care what goes on here: this is my home. I will not hesitate to voice my opinions at class meetings, even though my title will be secretary/treasurer. I intend to offer suggestions to the class president and vice-president (even if I am not elected) in addition to completing the other tasks that the office demands. My past experiences have not been numerous, but I have worked in student government before. I have also held a job which, among other things, entailed book keeping. I am very organized. Therefore, I will have no difficulties in meeting the re quirements of my office. Most importantly, 1 want to do this job; I search for the challenge that the office will provide. A vote for Garfinkel is a vote not on ly for confidence, but for accomplishment"
Noreen Walsh,"Why does a person seek an office in the stu dent government? For me personally, I have found that it is a good way in which to be in volved, hear ideas and get ideas heard. I feel that student government should not be limiting but expanding. The more that are involved the better it is. Too many times it seems that the students' views are not lis tened to and yet the outcome of whatever is at hand affects them the most. In the past, I was elected to be part of the general student council. Last year, I served as vice president of the student body at my high school. It was the first year that I had held such a position and found that I really liked it. Running for a position in the student government was a big decision, but after going through the year, I know that it was worth the effort. I like being involved and contributing to my class. We are one of the largest and brightest classes that has entered Bucknell recently. If we work at it, we should be remembered as the best."
Tom Elkas,"I am anxious to serve as a voting member of the student congress. 1 like meeting new people and working with a concerned, active group. The ABS is an important organization for it permits the students to vocalize their suggestions for a better student life. As dorm representative, I would be more than willing to do this in addition to relating back to the student body the results taken up by the ABS. In the position of dorm representative, I am considering Ideas for student breaks, en joyable fund-raising activities and, possibly, a band party for the freshman quad. There is much we can do but first we need the ap propriate people in the right positions. I look forward to serving you in the future."
David Grossman,"I feel that the residents of Kress Hall deserve equal and effective representation within the ABS. In order to achieve this, ex perienced and dedicated congressmen must be elected as dormitory representatives. As my high school class president for four years, I learned how to responsibly deal with the needs of my class, much as I would cooperate with those of you who live in Kress Hall, working towards common goals in the dormitory's best interests. As a dorm legislator, I will strive to make the Kress voice heard, so that any grievances or suggestions we would like to present about our dorm will not go unanswered. As a member of the ABS, I will represent Kress's better interests in the enactment of ABS legislation. I will also act as an effective liaison between the ABS and my consti tuents, so that Kress residents are always aware of what takes place during ABS meetings, as well as the ABS's plans for the future. Again, I would like to reiterate that I am seeking this office not only as a result of Kress Hall's entitlement to effective representation, but also my desire to benefit Kress Hall and to make it an integral part of a well-balanced Bucknell community."

Jeff Sieber,"I chose to run for dorm representative because of my past experiences in leader ship and because I enjoy working with peo ple. During my high school years, I served as Class president, and student council vice- president. I also helped with organizing various other activities in my high school, and enjoyed working with others. I have had to work with people because of the previously mentioned activities. I believe that a dorm that works together can accomplish the goals that they want to. With my experience, I believe that I can lead them to help our dorm achieve these goals."

Tricia Kennedy,"When I was twelve, my sister gave me a plaque, featuring the PEANUTS character, Lucy, which read, "" If you can't be right, be wrong at the top of your voice!'' That was supposed to be a hint; my sister thought I argued too much. Well, I still have that plaque standing on my desk in 306 Roberts West. But I've learned by now how to discuss things in a productive way. As a reporter for my high school paper, and here, for the BUCKNELLIAN, I have had to know how to listen to people's opinions and how to repre sent differing viewpoints fairly. I've had experience too, in presenting both opinions and factual data to a group as a delegate to Keystone Girls State, a program in which high school juniors form their own state government. I was the editor of the KGS newspaper and a county party chair man. My other leadership qualifications in clude the presidency of SUBS (the Super Useful Beautiful Servants), a community volunteer organization, and of the Cliff- hangers Club, which I also founded, where the members take hiking and biking trips together and participate in Christian fellowship. I have always enjoyed politics, whether campaigning for someone else, as I did for then-gubernatorial candidate Dick Thorn burgh, or for myself. I would welcome the chance to represent you in the ABS. What you think and what you have to say are im portant to me. As your representative, I would make sure that both have a chance to be heard."
Helayne L. Sherman,"Dorm life is an important aspect of col lege. It will be our home for most of the year, and like home, problems may arise and changes may be necessary. Some of these problems can't be resolved without the help of the ABS Congress. I will be responsible for informing them of the problems, ideas or opinions you may have and see that action is taken. I will represent any and all suggestions from the dorm as a whole or from in dividuals. These ideas can be anything from dorm activities to personal recommenda tions. I will keep you well informed as to the results and progress of any recommenda tions made to the Congress. In the past two years, I was representative to State and National Key Club Conventions. I also served as class representative to the student government in high school. I have had much experience in this area and I will work hard to have your views heard and make this a great year for you. quainted with one another.

That is the reason why I want to be an ABS representative. There is much work to be done. The opinions, attitudes and needs of students must be expressed to those in charge of four years of their life. Working within the administration this summer, I was often asked my opinion because they said ""you know how the students feel."" If the student body is working up to its potential, the administration should already know how the students feel. As a result of the lack of awareness, the students view is often pushed aside. I take pride in this University, knowing that the bad points it does have can be im proved by joint student effort, and by my own effort, not that of "" someone else."" Off campus students have very special needs apart from the residents and these needs often pass unheard.

Justice in America to be examin,
Different concepts of justice,
will each be discussed in turn,"By LYNNE RUTHERFORD Is there justice for children? Is the American prison system fair? To explore these and other topics, a four day sym posium conducted by the Bucknell Student Lectureship Committee entitled, ""Justice in America,"" begins on campus Monday. Justice is an all-encompassing concept that means different things to different people. Throughout history, every Society has set their own standard of criminal punishment: an eye for an eye, enforced slavery, or, as is the case in the U.S., in carceration. ""Justice means the right to due process under the law, which is what the prison project is trying to do,"" said Karl Patten, professor of English. Speaking as a representative of the Lewisburg Prison Project, Patten voiced a concern common to many of us--the treatment and rehabilitation of our nation's criminals. Today, we are faced with an ultimatum, for whether our prison system is too harsh or too lenient, it is simply not working. Soaring crime rates, particularly in our cities, attest to that. Unless some type of change is instituted soon, the problem will continue to grow. The types of alterations that are desperately needed will be among the topics discussed during the sym posium. Yet justice reaches beyond the criminal arena, permeating the social, economic, and political areas of society as well. "" It's a complex question. I'd have to think about it more, but to me, justice implies fairness,"" said Linda Thomas, visiting in structor of political science. Fairness? Is our nation totally fair to its weak, including its youth? Ken Wooden should have much to say on that subject Thursday night. The courtroom is another legal institu tion justice plays a paramount role in. "" In America, lawyers are trained to think only of their clients. Justice is presumed to emerge mysteriously out of combat bet ween two attorneys in the courtroom,"" said Michael Moohr, associate professor of economics. Once again, a fear familiar to many of us is being voiced: that there are so many legal loopholes, particularly for the rich, that true justice never triumphs. William Kunstler, who as a well-known civil rights lawyer has fought more than a few of those battles, will address this and other viewpoints in his lecture, "" Is There Justice in America?"" Along with these particular concerns, the symposium analyzes the more general ideal of justice, articulated by John Peeler, professor of political science. "" It's a very complex question--most important ly, everyone having an equal chance to develop their own potential as a human be ing."" . . That chance is lacking in our own society today. The "" Justice in America"" sym posium is an important event simply because it points out a few of the many reasons why."

Panelists to debate criminal justice system,"By STEVE RICHARDS Is there justice in the prison system? That is an all important question to many former and present inmates of federal prisons, as well as attorneys and criminologists. It will be the subject of a"
f,"ianel discussion here featuring two na- ionally konwn authorities, civil rights lawyer Aryeh Neier, and psychoanalyst Ernest Van den Haag. This discussion, the third of a four-part "" Justice in America"" seminar, will take place Wednesday at 7 pm in the University Center Forum. Matt Silberman, associate professor of sociology, will moderate. Aryeh Neier, the son of Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany, is a former executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union. He is the author of two books on the U.S. criminal justice system, has written numerous magazine and newspaper ar ticles, and is a frequent lecturer. Neier is now a professor at the New York Universi ty School of Law. Neier is highly concerned with what he sees as the dehumanizing treatment many prisoners receive. "" Institutions usually content themselves with degrading new in mates. They strip them naked, take away their possessions, issue formless clothing, assign them numbers, yell at them and tell them who is boss,"" Neier told the New York (Times) on July 3,1980. Dr. Ernest Van den Haag, a social philosopher, educator, lecturer, and author of the highly respected book, Political Violence and Civil Disobedience, will also participate. Van den Haag, as the title of his book im plies, is concerned with the control of crime. In contrast to Neier, he will present a conservative view of the criminal justice system. A third panelist, Faruq Muhammad, will offer an inside view of prison life the others cannot. As a former inmate of the Mississippi State Penitentiary, he is now the information coordinator at the Na tional Prison Project, an offshoot of the American Civil Liberties Union. The NPP deals with the enforcement of inmates' rights throughout all federal prisons. The fourth panelist is Karl Patten, pro fessor of English, who as a representative of the Lewisburg Prison Project has a PSHppf. great interest in "" improving the conditions of prison confinement."" Among the pro blems the LPP hopes to help correct are: overcrowding, discrimination, mail tampering, beatings and arbitrary rule en forcement. The LPP is a local volunteer oganization that not only monitors the rights of the prison population, but provides parole representation to those who cannot afford it. In the words of a Lewisburg inmate, "" You cannot imagine how frustrating it is to see one's privileges being steadily taken away week after week for no reason at all."" Federal judge James E. Doyle said as far back as 1972, "" I am persuaded that the institution of prison probably must end. In many respects, it is as intolerable as was the institution of slavery."" Some members of the panel agree with him, others do not. But the controversy over our nation's prison system will rage long after the discussion ends."

The topic for the series of talks and panel discussions, which wiu begin next Monday and end with Wooden's talk on Thursday, is "" Justice in America."" Wooden is scheduled to speak Thursday in Vaughn Literature Auditorium. The topic of his talk is "" Justice for Children -  A Time for Ad vocacy."" ,,  . . . Wooden's lecture will bring to light a subject about which many of us have never thought or knew existed: the incarceration of ch ild ren in institutions throughout the country. After completing a 30 state study of children in long term detention, Wooden found "" hor rors such as whippings, tear gassing, rape and solitary con finement of children."" In his book, and in his lectures at col leges nationwide, Wooden reveals these horrors, as well as the individuals he feels are responsible for these gruesome social injustices politicians, bureaucrats, the court system, and exploitative businessmen. He has been actively engaged in trying to persuade Congress to pass legislation which will pro tect these institutionalized children -- the same Congress that, he says is "" happy to spend $21 billion on the B-l bomber but only provides $13 million a year for the National Right to Read program."" Wooden's interest in the plight of problem children is a very per sonal one, as he himself was dismissed as uneducable as a child. It is ironic that such a child would re-enter society and not on ly prove it wrong about himself, but also denounce the many in justices to other young people. In stead of being given a chance to realize their potential, these children are punished, Wooden insists, for crimes which they have not committed, or for being an unlucky member of a broken family environment. Wooden's message serves not only to alert people around the country to what is happening to our nation's youth, but to rally them to the worthwhile cause of rectifying an incompetent penal system in America."

"Friday, September 19.1980",
First 1980,
presidential debate: three crowd?,"By PHIL ANDREWS Much has been said of Jimmy Carter's refusal to meet John Anderson and Ronald Reagan in this Sunday's nationally televised ' League of Women Voters- sponsored debate. And rightly so. Throughout the primary and general election campaigns, Carter has financed his reelec tion drive by drawing from the national interest. On the morning of the Illinois primary, the nation awoke to hear Carter announce that significant progress had been made in the efforts to secure the release of the American hostages in Iran. For months, Carter has played politics with the defense budget. For example, he has stated sup port for the volunteer army, but has consistently refused to sup port pay increases necessary to attract and retain key military personnel. He has championed draft registration, contending that it would save 90 to 100 days if a draft were needed. In a January, 1980 report, however, Selective Service Director Ber nard Rostker wrote that only seven days would be saved. And now, as during the primary campaign, Mr. Carter has decided to forego a debate he ""had pledged to participate in. Fortunately, Sunday's debate will go on whether Carter is there or not. And so it will be John Anderson and Ronald Reagan in the first, and perhaps only, debate of the general election campaign For Anderson, qualifying for the League debates was essential for .a viable candidacy. It is the only way he can become well- known to the majority of the American electorate. If he stumbles, his candidacy will be effectively over. If he does well, there are enough voters disillusioned with Mr. Carter and Mr. Reagan to make him presi dent. To "" win""  the debate and draw close to the Democratic and Republican nominees, Anderson must articulate three things: 1) He must make a compelling case that his National Unity plat form is superior to those of Carter and Reagan. Crucial dif ferences need to be singled out. He should stress the im portance of reducing"
U.S.,"dependence on OPEC oil and ex plain his proposal for a 50 cent tax on gasoline. He should emphasize his sup port for a lean, flexible and strong national defense, and ex plain why he opposed mammoth missile systems like the MX. How he plans to strengthen the volunteer army should be made clear as well. And he should reiterate his deep commitment to the Equal Rights Amendment, and to a pro- choice abortion position. His leadership on civil rights issues should be underscored. 2) He must highlight Carter's ineffectual leadership and vacillation on domestic and foreign policy. 3) He must demonstrate the contradictions contained in many of Reagan's policy statements. For example, Reagan will be hard-pressed to explain how he would raise defense spending, lower taxes and balance the budget without cutting popular social programs. Reagan will find people slow to swallow his prescription of op position to the"
ERA,and rhetorical support for equal rights for women. And his professed concern for nuclear arms control will ^ be viewed by many as incompatible with his opposition to the SALT II
treaty.,"While Anderson must adopt a three-pronged approach, Reagan has the luxury of attacking an eminently vulnerable candidate who will not be present to defend his record -- or to probe Reagan's. The Republican nominee will: 1) Blast Mr. Carter's economic policies as disastrous "" for the average American,""  and em phasize his support for the Kemp- Roth plan to slash income taxes by 30 percent over three years; 2) C h aracterize C a rter' s foreign policy as weak, using Afghanistan, Iran and Nicaragua as examples. If asked to specify what he would do, he will tend to beg off, stating that only the president is privy to the requisite information -"
"""Eh d E _ --3","Katie Mansuy Reagan will propose large in creases in defense spending, arguing for "" peace through strength;"" 3) Emphasize his opposition to "" excessive government spen ding""  and "" unnecessary regula tion.""  Reagan will not be specific about the programs and regula tions he considers "" excessive"" and "" unnecessary,""  for that is what many people disagree on. He will refer liberally to his days and record as governor of California; 4) And he will ignore Anderson -- except when he can place Anderson and Carter on one side of an issue and himself on the other. Jimmy Carter also has a strategy for the debate. He will attempt to smother the barbs from Baltimore with a plethora of media events. If Carter "" wins,"" he will con tinue to avoid Anderson -- even at the expense of no debate with Reagan. Should Carter "" lose,""  he may find he has no choice but to join Anderson and Reagan a se cond time around. Interestingly, House Minority Leader John Rhodes (R-AZ) believes that it is not in the na-' tional interest that President Carter, or any other President; participate in campaign debates. "" Under the stress of the moment, a sitting president is liable to say some things that might harm Ou foreign policy or our domestic policy."" Presidents, however; are under stress much of the time. It goes with the job. Surely it is in the national interest in 1980 to have the opportunity before the election to observe the presiden tial aspirants in close, pressure- packed encounters of a triple kind."

Will Cronkite and Co. create our next president?,"By TODD G. BUCHHOLZ You know, Jimmy is right. Mr Anderson is a creation of the media. But who isn't? Lately, it's been very fashionable to criticize the press. Twenty five years ago everyone talked about Russia and the bomb. Just a few years ago hating Nixon was chic. People would compete for the title of having hated Nixon first. Today we scorn the media. We deplore the little men with anten nae crawling around political conventions chasing rumors. We can't wait for Cronkite to retire. Ironically, it was Nixon who had the foresight to despise the press first. So how is our presidential race being reported or distorted? First, we must realize that politicians and the mass media have a common interest in avoiding issues. Why? For candidates, issues cause complications and don't attract many votes. Talk to George Bush about China, he'll tell you. For the media, issues don't sell newspapers. We are thus left with personalities, perceptions of character and appearances. Because of the media's liberal bias, Ronald Reagan suffers the most from such dreadful coverage. Jimmy Carter is neither harmed nor helped. John B. Anderson gets the best deal. One at a time. The Democrats' primary tactic is to portray Ronald Reagan as an old man and as David Brinkley put it, ""a combination of Scrooge and the Mad Bomber."" The media are playing right along. Instead of carefully examining positions and challenging policies, they examine the"

Whoever wrote the caption for the photo of Reagan somehow forgot why Reagan was in the hospital. The caption: ""Ronald Reagan spends forty minutes in hospital."" Esquire magazine devoted its August issue to the Republican candidate. On the cover is a pic ture of Ronnie wearing a cowboy hat and pointing a pistol cocked and ready to fire. The title of the issue: ""We warned you about JOHNSON. We warned you about NIXON. We warned you about CARTER. Now will you please listen to us about REAGAN?"" After reading the magazine, I was stunned. There was no bad news. I shook the copy and turned it upside down, hoping the ugly stuff would fall out. Nothing. The fact is, Esquire in vestigated all of Reagan's past and was disappointed. They therefore printed an in criminating cover, expecting that alone to sway their readers. Even Garry Wills concluded his piece with fallacious fluff: ""the scary thing about Reagan: that he doesn't scare us."" Profound. Jimmy Carter has not had it easy either. The press exploited ""Billygate"" to sell as many papers as it could. They have reported all the scandals from Lance to Andrew Young to Tim Kraft, who was accused of using cocaine this week. Jack Anderson's accusation that Carter was planning an inva sion of Iran was of no help. Perhaps out of gentleness or humaneness, though, the media has not pointed out his pitiful record. We've got serious pro blems with our economy and foreign policy. But the press thinks that Ted Kennedy's sup port should be the basis of the"

For he is the alternative, as if that is a sufficient basis for choosing a leader. Rather than checking his votes in Congress for the Kemp-Roth tax cut and for nuclear power, they check his ""viability rating"" each day and tell us about his wife Keke's 49th birthday. As I see it, Anderson is chang ing his views to attract the liberal Kennedy folks, the Easterners, and the New York Times editorial board. He's like the Frenchman during the revolu tion, who sees the mob running down the street and reaches for his coat. ""Where are you going?"" his friend asks. ""To find out where they're run ning to so I can lead them. ' '"

There are fundamental con tradictions in the proposals of all three candidates. The rhetoric has obviously befuddled the reporters. Reagan, Carter and Anderson are magicians; and the reporters are wide-eyed kids, often wat ching the decoy hand of the pro fessionals. They'd better catch on to the act. Of course, we can't blame the media for everything, but they could do a better job informing the public. So far they have created not one candidate, Mr. President, but three: a chic alternative who mysteriously reconsiders; an in cumbent who flip-flops; and a challenger too senile to recall what he said originally."

Christy's Gate'is a,
smashing success,"By AMY KENNEDY Christy's Gate, a temporary cafe run by Concern and Action, opened Wednesday to en thusiastic response. The innova tion provides a change of pace for those who are tired of the noisy atmosphere of the Bison and fraternity parties. The ambience is that of a Greenwich Village pub -- re laxed, informal and, if the right company is available, romantic. The location is the Faculty Lounge on the second floor of the University Center. The simple decor of the room has been enhanced through the use of dif ferent sized round tables, candlelight and the importation of plants to create a totally new image. Live entertainment utilizing the piano in the main room and supplied by talented students pro vides a mellow background that makes Christy's Gate an ideal place for uninterrupted conversa tion. Never does one feel pressured to hurry and leave, rather, visitors are encouraged to linger over their repast and savor the few moments of respite Chris ty's Gate gives them. Along with the tranquil mood prevalent, there is also a superb and unimposing menu -- featur ing home-made pastries and all natural Pennsylvania cheeses at reasonable prices. Cheeses, served with crackers or vegetable sticks, are fresh from the dairy, and a basket con taining a generous portion of Swiss or Havarti cheese or an ex ceptionally fine smoked cheese- spread, costs $1.50. Onion dip runs $1.25. The pastries, for those with a sweet tooth, are made by two Muncy women and include a cheese or raspberry danish with streusel topping (30 cents) that has the old-fashioned taste only home-baking can give, cinnamon bread with melted butter (25 cents), and warm sticky buns (20 cents). To quench the thirst are two drinks (both 50 cents) -- an orange mixture made popular by the Orange Julius chain of snack bars, and the Christy's Special, a frothy blend of orange and grapefruit juices. ""The drinks are great,"" one student complimented, ""but they do need more variety."" From the moment a customer enters, the service he receives is excellent. Six waiters and waitresses on each shift, as well as six more people in the kitchen, labor to take and fill orders as quickly and efficiently as possi ble. All workers at the Gate serve on a volunteer basis and are trained by CA members. Student response to the new gathering place is highly"

String Quartet showcases Shostakovich,"By DAVID O'CONNELL The return of the Fitzwilliam String Quartet to Bucknell after their residency in the fall of 1978 has been long-awaited by the local concert-going community. For some, Sunday's concert provided, like a page from an album, another glimpse of a group that many have called the world's primary interpreters of the works of Shostakovich. For others, it provided the first look at a cultural treat--one of the most cohesive of today's quartets in their finest medium, as they performed not one, but two Shostakovich quartets, the First and the Ninth. At first some might have been skeptical about the logic of programming two Shostakovich quartets, preferring to hear them one at a time so that the full value of each could stand alone and be pondered in its entirety. However, the choice of the First and Ninth provided an interesting contrast of the early extrovert against the pensive Shostakovich evident in his later works. The audience sat back against the hard chapel pews and awaited the opening of the C major quartet. Immediately the rich warmth of tone and the precisely accurate balance was evident. Too often quartets are content to just play the notes, but the Fitzwilliam interacts to the point where the group becomes one entity with four voices. The first quartet is unpretentious, unassuming, and uncomplicated both in its logistics and its musical statements. It received an appropriate, refreshing rendi tion that is best described as lighthearted. The four movements were tied together quite well, as everything seemed to lead up to the finale. The reverie of the first movement with its rich, relaxed, rhapsodic harmony was followed by a theme and variations that in creased the musical action. The third movement served as a short buildup of ten sion which was effectively released by the onrush of sound in the joyous finale. Two qualities of the Fitzwilliam evidenc ed themselves quite readily in this piece. In the theme and variations movement, particularly, the quartet met a high stan dard for sound texture. The requirement that a listener not ""notice"" the entrance of a voice -- rather, become aware gradual ly that the musical texture has changed -- was successfully fulfilled. In the third movement, it becomes ob vious that the quartet realizes they must strive to play as one unit. All four in struments are muted, providing a common ground by which the blending of sound can be judged. As the Ninth quartet opened, one was im mediately aware that Shostakovich asks for far more than printed notes. The begin ning was rather whimsical and un threatening, yet the quartet brought out a thickness in the harmony that spoke of something more impending in the background. The success of the Ninth quartet depends on changes in energy and texturing. It is a much more ""symphonic"" work, often making it difficult to believe that only four voices were filling the hall so richly. The subtle energy increases and decreases were never overdone, and abrupt changes, such as the sharp pizzacato chord out bursts in the fourth movement, were capitalized upon to their fullest extent. The Brahms Clarinet Quintet, which stood as the only work on the second half of the program, is probably the composer's finest, most profound chamber work. It was a pure performance, and the blending with Lesley Schatzberger's clarinet was exquisite. Schatzberger's solos in the Adagio movement were forceful but not overly so, and she utilized to its fullest extent the in- bred ability of the clarinet to weave its way in and out of the musical texture. Some of the quintet's interpretation was a bit ""thick,"" but this is a quality inherent in much of Brahms. One becomes very conscious of the ac tual performance when watching the Fitz william Quartet. Subtle movements within the group, as when two voices with similar parts turn towards one another, add a physical dimension that increases the uni- ty of sound. It is possible to follow changes in melody and accompaniment simply by watching. On the other hand, none of the physical elements of quartet playing -- movement, actual playing, style, or breathing -- ever intrude upon the purity of their music. The Cleveland Quartet, believed to be excellent interpreters of Brahms, breathe so deeply and sharply at entrances that this unwelcome noise is added to the music. Breathing together is a device that aids the quartet in keeping together, and the Fitzwilliam has been ever conscious of this. There might be voiced only three objec tions to the overall performance. First, the program was a bit on the ""heavy"" side. The Brahms and the Shostakovich Ninth are both ""headliner"" pieces that could each anchor any program. One might rather have heard something in the vein of Mozart's delightful Clarinet Quintet than the more intense Brahms work, which seemed to intrude upon the profound effect of the Shostakovich. Secondly, first violinist Christopher Rowland's new violin seemed to be ex- periencing ""growing pains."" Passage work on the E string was at times tinny and slightly off in intonation. Overall, however, the new instrument increased, the homogeneity of the quartet's sound, and is excellently suited to carrying the' melody, especially in the middle registers. Last, and most important, was the au dience's feelings about the quartet. It is vital to the appreciation and objective judgment of a performance that the listener take his seat with no preconceived notion of how ""great"" the concert will be. Sunday's audience was ""pre-sold"" on the Fitzwilliam. There is nothing entirely wrong with this, as their performance was in most ways worthy of the audience's praises, but this anticipation of Performing Arts Series events has become a bad Bucknell habit. Remembering the Eugene Fodor concert, which was little more than a demonstration of technique and not music, and the audience's response to it, one wor ries that the campus will blindly accept any performance placed before it without being critically discerning."
FSQ: the 'gents,
9,
room',
approach in public halls,"By AMY FORTGANG Signs of the mutual admiration that the Fitzwilliam String Quartet has established with the University have been seen throughout the first 13 days of their residency here. Although shorter than their previous five-week visit in 1978, this period has a closeness to it because of what Christopher Rowland, the first violinist of the group, calls ""the relationships developed."" These ""relationships,"" established two years ago and maintained through both long-distance communication and actual visits to the quartet's home in York, England, Bucknell students and faculty have left a ""tremendous impression"" on the four men. Rowland, in an interview Tuesday with the Bucknellian said, ""We came here two years ago and made many friends. When you have that kind of relationship you want to keep it up."" For this reason the four str ing p lay ers and Lesley Schatz- berger--clarinetist and violist and Alan George's wife--were eager to return to the University when they were approached with the idea by James Hammerlee, direc tor of student activities and University Center programs. George commented on the ""tremendous response"" the quartet received from the audience assembledJ^r ttyejr QonceU ^up- day. When the group walked onto the stage in Rooke Chapel an ovation ensued that caused them to take a bow before they had even played the first piece. ""That sort of thing is really heartwarm ing,"" George said, ""and comes only when you have intimate contact with the people in your audience, when you are more in volved with them."" Involved is not the word. Hammerlee has kept the five visitors on a round of recep tions, meetings and parties, an endless ""involvement"" with the University com munity that has them all suffering from what cellist Ian Davies affectionately calls ""Jim-lag."" ""I love having mem nere,"" one student said. ""They're not like your typical artists. When you talk to them they're so human and friendly. I was pleasantly surprised."" The openness of the quartet with students was also noted by George. ""I was in the Gents' room the other day,"" he said in illustration, ""and I was talking to a student. We remarked that all barriers are broken down in here. I mean, we're just men. And then he seemed stunn ed when I continued to talk with him when we got through the door of the Gents' room and into the hallway."" It is this kind of interaction with students, and with the public in general, that makes the Fitzwilliam String Quartet as popular"

"The Fitzwilliam String Quartet (from left to right: Christopher Rowland, violin;",
"loan Davies, cello; Alan George, viola, and Jonathan Sparey, violin, has re",
turned to Bucknell for a second residency. The wish has been expressed by,
members of the group that such visits become a regular event.,"tion Sunday evening. An unsolicited show of feeling and regard, such as that elicited by their ap pearance in the Chapel, is not only ""heart warming"" but also gives the performers a confidence that allows them to relax and enjoy the presentation of their art, George said. ""Actually,"" Hammerlee joked, ""the quartet has been so well received that we're thinking of making this an annual event."" According to the members of the quartet Hammerlee's jest is less improbable than it might at first seem to be. ""We would be very happy,"" Rowland said, ""to return to Bucknell whenever our schedule makes it at all possible."" Because the University system in England works on a trimester basis, the only available time for such a visit is in the ear ly fall. Regardless of future plans, there is still time left during the present residency to see the group in action. The quartet will perform as accompanists in Schatz berger's innovative clarinet recital at 8:15 tonight in the University Center Forum. They also have one more full-scale concert scheduled. At 8:30 p.m. Monday, Oct. 6, the Fitzwilliam String Quartet will present their final performance of the year in Rooke Chapel. Their next public appearance will be their debut at Carnegie Recital Hall, Oct. 8 ."

",","By LYNNE RUTHERFORD Combine a bored suburban wife with an insane, sexually motivated killer and you get ""Dressed to Kill,"" Brian De Palma's graphic mixture of sex and violence. ""Dressed To Kill"" opens tonight at the Campus Theatre on Market Street. Gaining a large following and huge box office receipts mainly because of the most famous shower scene since Hitchcock, this film is a flawed, lurid, and often shocking melodrama. Angie Dickinson turns in one of her best screen performances to date as Kate, a sexually dissatisfied woman looking for excitement. Through intelligently sparse dialogue and, more often, skillful facial expressions, Dickinson is able in a short period of time to establish a touching and fully developed character. The use of music and photography throughout ""Dressed To Kill"" is superb, particularly during Dickinson's scenes. The best shot sequence of the movie, a romp by Kate and a stranger through a museum, is a study of control and subtle humor. Even during the latter half of the film, played strict ly for chills, the music and photography remained excellent. Dickinson's explicit shower scene and the nature of her erotic fantasies have stirred a furor among feminists that is unlikely to abate until the movie ends its theatrical run. When her character, Kate, is dispensed with, ""Dressed To Kill"" rapidly degenerates into just another horror flick. Although several suspenseful and well-placed chills remain, the film, due to a poor screenplay, fails to achieve its early potential. After an in telligent beginning, De Palma falls prey to laziness and settles for thrills at the expense of well- developed characterizations and a clear storyline. Michael Caine is wasted. As K ate's psychiatrist, he is never given an opportunity to develop his character, which remains threadbare throughout the movie. The camera lingers long over Nancy Allen, who plays a high-priced prostitute, but her acting lacks definition and purpose. Allen, who perhaps not coin cidentally is De Palma's wife, produces a strained and somewhat tedious performance. Unlike those of Dickinson, her sexual scenes are tasteless and over done. Undoubtedly the worst thing in the picture is the horribly contrived and overwritten role of a tough city cop. Likewise, the role of Kate's teenage genius son is one dimensional. The film's conclusion, wherein all the characters are pulled Agatha Christie-like into one room, just fails to put together all the hows and whys of the killer. But for an old-fashioned scare, without too much thought as to what is plausible or not, ""Dressed to Kill"" will suffice."
"John Houseman, actor, will lecture","Actor and Director John Houseman, best known for his Academy Award-winning per formance as the tyrannical Pro fessor Kingsfield in ""The Paper Chase,"" has been signed as the keynote speaker for this year's Celebration of the Arts. Houseman will present his lec- ture on the general history of the American theater in the past 40 years and will lead a drama workshop.

Erick Hawkins troupe,
gets mixed responses,"By AMY FORTGANG Erick Hawkins, dancer and choreographer, brought his dance troupe here Tuesday and Wednesday for a series of lec tures, dem onstrations and master classes, culminating each night with a full-length per formance in Coleman Theater. Hawkins' theory of dance per formance is that the audience should not watch the costumes or scenery but the movement of the d a n c e r s ' b o d i e s .  Th e knowledgeable viewer will swift ly ascertain that Hawkins' ap proach to dance is not merely training, but a way of life. No skinny, undernourished dancers for him. One gets an impression of extreme good health and ex cellent physical condition. His dancers, all trained at a feed-in school in New York City in accordance with his own special standards that emphasize fluidi ty, have strict control of their bodies, and in performance can move smoothly together as one unit. In a master class Wednesday afternoon, Hawkins vehemently stated that ""costumes, scenery"
sj&ar,"%s 3 and story-line should not intrude into the contemplation of the ac tual dance."" Through Wednesday night's performance he both affirmed and denied that stand. The evening's program opened with ""Agathlon,"" performed by all eight of the company members on a stage bereft of scenery except for a free standing modern sculpture. Multi-colored leotards set off the primary hues of the set-piece and allowed the audience to see minute body movement. A celebration of Hawkins' ideals, the piece permitted no outside influences to distract f r o m  t h e  n o n - s t o r i e d choreography, though subtle and lightning-quick costume changes somewhat undermined the basic premise and seemed to serve no purpose. One anticipated more of the same pure dance, but in the se cond piece -- ""Plains Daybreak"" -- Hawkins began to deviate from his own lines by portraying animals and man at the beginn ing of the world. The use of surrealistic masks"
fig,"aided in the identification of creatures and each dancer show ed the essence of his role through repetition of characteristic movements. Hawkins, making his initial ap pearance of the evening as the First Man, did not have the lightness and total control that he demands of his dancers. His movements were less sharply defined and one got the idea that any of his corps members could have performed the role with more professionalism. It might be debated that Hawkins was hoping to convey the clumsiness of man in com parison to the grace of animals. This argument could be accep table had the same problem not occurred again in the last number, which played to a much- emptied house. Despite an excellent comedic performance by Craig Nazor as Parson Weems, ""Parson Weems and the Cherry Tree, Etc."" was essentially an over-cutesy por trayal of the famous George Washington - and - the - cherry - tree legend. One would assume that, with his own orchestra at hand to play written-to-order music and with the highly talented lighting designer he has in Robert Engstrom, Hawkins would utilize his uniquely trained dancers to promote his own dance theories in the form of pure dance presen tations. Judging from Wednes day's performance, he does much better when he stays away from stories, and concentrates on bodies and their movements and interactions."

anticipation of exhibit,"By ROBIN MEREDITH The University's Permanent Collection of fine art for the first time is undergoing a complete inventory, according to Andrea Hinds, direc tor of the Center Gallery. "" Our goal is to write a catalogue of all the works owned by Bucknell so we know what we have and can utilize it,""  Hinds said. The compilation will result in an illustrated listing of each piece of art and its history. Pam Feir, a graduate assistant, and Susan Carr '81 are aiding Hinds in the creation of the reference system, which she calls an ongo ing process that will never be fully completed. All available informa tion about each work--including an identification number and date of acquisition--will be included. The sources of most of the art are private collections of people con nected with the University, although there are some pieces purchased by the University. Because the collection is distributed throughout the cam pus--much of it on display in the Kress Gallery at the Ellen Clark Ber trand Library--there will be a central file detailing the location of each item and recording when and where it is moved, thereby forming a "" system of control."" The filing and cataloguing will be useful to students who wish to study the collection by making it possible for them to know the whereabouts and history of any piece before research is begun, Hinds said. If the University ever forms a museum, she added, the collection will be in readiness. Some categories of the collection--for example, the large number of prints in storage--can be used in art classes as well. Among items uncovered were two high-quality paintings by iPrendergast, now on display in the library, an American impres sionist from the early 20th century, and works by other well-known American artists, including George Inness. The inventory is not a matter of simply documenting each item. Discovery is followed by research to trace the history of the piece in a continuing process that seeks to erase the labels of "" Unidentified Ar tist""  and "" Unidentified Title."" The paintings of the Kress Gallery, including a portrait attributed to the famous painter Tintoretto, have already been catalogued, but The Permanent Collection does not consist solely of paintings. It in cludes furniture, prints and large Japanese collections. The highlight of the inventory process will be a display of selec tions from the finer works of The Permanent Collection in the Center Gallery. The exhibit is scheduled for January."

First act will be 'Spiritwood,
9,"By DAVID BLACKMAN The Coffeehouse organization, under the management of Rob Guimento '81 and assistant manager Sue Dettbam '81, opens tomorrow night in the University Center Forum. Long an outlet for campus talent as well as quality outside performers, the Coffeehouse is an integral element of student enter tainment, running Wednesday dinner shows and weekend pro grams. This year 25 acts auditioned for only eight weekend slots. "" The competition was stiff and the decisions were difficult to make,"" Guimento said. "" We were extremely pleased to see so many promising fresh acts to go with the remaining consistent quality of our more experienced groups,""  he said. When asked what standards they used for judging the acts, Guimento and Dettbam cited sound quality as the top priority followed by stage presence and the performers' ability to enter tain an audience for an entire show. Claiming their schedule is "" strong and able to satisfy all tastes,"" the management of the Coffeehouse presents a plethora of events for the entertainment seeking campus community. Beginning the season on Satur day with two shows is the return ing off-campus group "" Spirit- wood.""  Featuring original folk ballads accom panied by a- coustic guitar, this popular hus band and wife team will perform in the forum at 8 and 9:30 p.m. The next Coffeehouse, Friday, Oct. 10, at 9 p.m., is in conjunc tion with the Homecoming ac tivities and will be held in Davis Gym to accommodate the ex pected large turnout. This special program will include the talents of Bucknell alumni Bob and Bill Grabowski, The John Roll Band and Jonathan Sprout, all per forming original works. Parents Weekend, Oct. 17 and 18, returns the Coffeehouse to its familiar home in the University Center Cave for two per formances nightly at 8 and 10 p.m . by Carolyn Odell of Rochester,"

Bison harriers Steve Bigotto '82 and Glenn Gibney '83 lead the pack early in last Saturday's race,
against Columbia. Eleven Bucknell runners finished before the fifth fcion man,"ByROBBYSTETZ and JEFF CROSS The men's cross country team edged Columbia 25-32 Saturday, stretch in g their six -y ea r unbeaten streak to an incredible 65 straight meets. The race featured a tough, four-way battle for first place between Bisons Steve Bigotto '82 and Bill Reifsnyder '84, and Lion runners Charles Miers and Mike O'Brien. The four harriers main tained a tight pack in front of the field until they neared the three- mile mark, where Bigotto broke away. Reifsnyder stayed close and eventually pulled ahead, break ing the tape in 25:29.1, the second- best time ever by a Bison freshman on the 5.15 mile circuit. Reifsnyder was the Pennsylvania high school champion last year. Bigotto finished second with a time of 25:55, followed by Lions Miers and O'Brien at 25:57 and 25:59, respectively. A total of eleven Bucknell har riers finished before the fifth Col umbia man came home. Among those were freshmen Jeff Hines (7th place), John Leary (11th), Mike Deckert (12th), and Tom Richardson (14th). The best performance by the Bison tri-captains was the 16th place finish by Jim O'Shea '81. Mike Debraggio placed 21st and Rick Sayre '82 dropped out after being trampled following a fall."

The harriers will attempt to ex tend their streak Saturday when thev travel to Van Cortland Park their loss to Manhattan in the districts last season, where Bucknell finished fifth. Gulden warns, "" They have the tendency to be very ready, very early in the season."" The Bisons have never faced Rutgers in a dual meet before, but lost to the Scarlet Knights in the Bucknell Invitational tourna ment two years ago. Last fall, Rutgers faltered with many in juries and finished in the middle of the field in the eastern cham pionships. Gulden is an alumnus of Rutgers and would delight in beating his former coach. Gulden ran cross country for the Scarlet Knights as a freshman twenty years ago. Gulden noted, "" If Rutgers is healthy, they should have some good people,""  but added that "" both the players and I will be disappointed if we don't beat both Rutgers and Manhattan. How ever, the race may be closer than it probably should be because Rutgers will be so psyched up."" and fullback Don Clark power the running game. After last week's 38-7 defeat by the University of Connecticut, Curtis commented, "" It's easy to say that the season is already over but you can be back and back quick. We have to make a stand now."""

Lock Haven defeats,
field hockey by 3-1,"The Bison field hockey team dropped its second match of the season, a 3-1 decision at Lock Haven State College on Thurs- The stickers fell behind the Division I Golden Eagles 2-0 at the half. Both goals resulted from powerful drives off penalty cor ners, according to co-captam Anne Kennedy '82. Lock Haven tallied a third goal midway through the second half against Betsy Doyle '82, who earlier saved a Golden Eagle penalty stroke. The Bisons' second half ag gressiveness finally paid off when freshman Nancy Dill scored the first Bucknell goal of the campaign, with an assist to Kennedy. The Bison rally was short-lived, however; and the Golden Eagles were victorious. Doyle had 13 saves while Bucknell could only manage eight shots at the Lock Haven net. Coach Sally Starr noted the fine play of senior co-captain Jill Henry on defense, Jeanne Minahan '83 at link and Dill at forward. The Bisons have until next Saturday to prepare for Ithaca College, a team that defeated Bucknell 3-0 last season and was second ranked in New York state. The Bison home opener starts at 1 p.m. on the Bucknell west fields."
Yanks' Guidry back,
in starting rotation,"New York Yankees hurler Ron Guidry marked his return to the starting rotation with a 5-4 vic tory over the Toronto Blue Jays Tuesday night at Yankee Stadium. The game was Guidry s first start since his August 18 loss in Baltimore. During his three-week stmt in the bullpen, Guidry made a total of eight relief appearances, allowing four earned runs while striking out 15 and walking only one. Guidry was the American League Cy Young Award winner in 1978, compiling a 25-3 regular- season record."
John Harrington,

JE F F  CROSS,"The Mudsharks, the men's ultimate frisbee team, hosted Penn State and the Jersey Jolt #last Saturday to open their fall season. Bucknell began the afternoon with an easy 19-5 victory over Penn State. The Mudsharks were clearly the superior team and have consistently defeated the Lions in the past. Spokesman Mel Bayo '81 commented that ""our zone defense worked very well' in allowing only five goals. After only 15 minutes' rest, the Mudsharks were back in ac tion against the Jolt, a combina tion of Bucknell alumni, the Knights of Nee, and Glassboro State, the defending national champions. The 'Sharks fell behind early due to inexperience and many turnovers. Despite holding their own against the Jolt offense in the second half, the deficit was too much to overcome and the Mud sharks fell, 21-13. In the day's final game, Jersey crushed Penn State. The Mudsharks will be back in action Saturday in Mercerville, New Jersey, as they challenge the University of Pennsylvania, the Knights of Nee and the Mercer Disc Connection."

Women's X-country,
seeks improvement,"By JAN BALAKIAN "" We expect the team to score much better than last year,""  said second-year runner Laura Gaydos '83 of Saturday's Penn State In vitational. The Bisons finished a disappointing eighth last year out of a field of ten but Gaydos believes the Bison women's cross coun try squad was overwhelmed by the size of such schools as Cornell and the University of Maryland, the latter of which gives athletic scholarships to many of its athletes. Last season the women harriers turned in an impressive 6-1 record but this year will be without the services of Ann Bischoff, the outstanding Bison captain who graduated last spring. The returning upperclassmen have all bettered their times con siderably, however, and their times are greatly improved because of more challenging practices. "" This year most of the runners are fairly equal in ability and as a result practices are more com petitive,""  Gaydos said. Coach Dianne Ware also expressed enthusiasm over the poten tial of the freshmen, citing Karen Flanigan, Nancy Nelson, Patty Reilly and Judie Olson as the names to look for. Gaydos believes Saturday's confrontation at Penn State will be an unusual challenge because the women will have to contend with a four-mile race rather than the three-mile course to which they are accustomed. "" It will be difficult for us to pace ourselves,"" she said. Ware expects the Bisons' toughest competition to come from Penn State, West Chester, Shippensburg and Temple. _____________"
7th at West Point,
Golfers disappoint,"By BOB DAVIS and JEFF CROSS Following last week's AFC picks, we present our equally dazzling predictions for the National Football Conference."
NFC EAST,"To many fans the retirement of legandary quarterback Roger Staubach signalled the end of the Dallas dynasty, but replacement Danny White ,iould be ready to take command after several seasons as understudy. The return of Ed "" Too Tall"" Jones restores the Cowboys' "" Doomsday Defense"" to past prowess. Dick Vermeil's Philadelphia Eagles are finally read to challenge the best of the NFL. A solid defense and a potent offense led by Ron Jaworski, Harold Carmichael and Wilbur Montgomery, plus a 'year of experience will make the Eagles a Super Bowl threat. Washington always seems to be in the race despite a timeworn defense and offense of cast-offs led by quarterback Joe Theismann. This year will be no different for the Redskins. A lack of players of the caliber of all-pro linebacker Brad Van Pelt leave the Giants with a deficient defense. Quarterback Phil Simms at tempts to move an offense that lacks a solid running game. . The playoff flame began to flicker in St. Louis several years ago and has since gone out. Running back Otis Anderson alone does not have the spark to relight the Cardinals."
NFCCENTRAL,"John McKay's Tampa Bay team will prove that last year's banner season was no fluke. Quarter back Doug Williams and powerful backs Ricky Ball and Jerry Eckwood lead the offense, while Leroy Selmon anchors the Buccaneer defense, the NFL's best in 1979. Former Oklahoma sensation Billy Sims should provide the offense punch needed to lift Detroit out of the NFC cellar. The Lions may still be a couple of players away from a playoff berth. Walter Payton's talent will keep the Chicago Bears in the running in the NFC's weakest division. Minnesota will try to regain past glory with the talented Tommy Kramer at the helm. The Vikings' young defense is bolstered by veteran linebackers Jeff Siemon and Matt Blair. Green Bay's championship days are a faded memory. Bart Starr's young and promising Packers are still a few years from respectability."
NFC WEST,"The Rams' biggest obstacle on their way to yet another division title is how to please the fans they left behind in Los Angeles. With two quality quarter backs in Pat Haden and Vince Ferragamo, a pierc ing offensive thrust and a stingy defense, the Rams could be on their way to another Super Bowl. San Francisco hopes Thomas "" Hollywood"" Henderson will give the Forty-Niners the talent to challenge in the west. Steve Debery and Paul Hofer are offensive leaders. After years of mediocrity, New Orlenas may have finally built a winner. Archie Manning, Chuck Muncie, and Wes Chandler will power the Saints' high scoring offense. The Falcons, a playoff team two seasons ago, have slipped considerably since. Steve Bartkowski, Wally Francis, and rookie Junior Miller are bright spots on Atlanta's offense. In the playoffs, look for the Rams to topple the Eagles for a return meeting with the Steelers in the Super Bowl. We'll leave that contest up to you."

OFF,"By JEFF CROSS The men's golf team opened its fall season last weekend with a seventh place finish at the West Point Invitational tournament. Temple University won the two-day tournament by out- shooting the 22 team field with an aggregate score of 586. Bucknell lagged behind with a 612 total. In a playoff for individual honors, Kevin Klier of Temple defeated Dave Camevale of James Madison with a birdie on the first extra hole. Klier's total was 69-71-140. The Bisons' aspirations were dashed when Kevin High '82 dislocated his shoulder on his first swing of the opening round. He nevertheless managed to shoot a courageous round of 84 before dropping out of the tourna ment. High shot an impressive 69 in an earlier practice round. Bill Francis '83 was the leading Bison golfer as he tied for 13th place with 75-76-151. Dave Richards '81 was close behind by shooting 78-75-153. Rob Wagner '81 and Rick Kramer '83 tied with 77-77-154 and 73-81-154 totals, respectively. Coach Jeff Ranck was disap pointed in the team's showing and hopes the scores will improve this weekend. The Bisons will get more major tournament ex posure at the Yale Fall Inter collegiate tournament in New Haven, Connecticut. A strong field is expected for Thursday's onening round."

-12,
p.m.,"By STEVEN SKOLNICK and MICHAEL SUAREZ The Bisons were neither outclassed nor intimidated in their 38-7 loss to the University of Connecticut Huskies last Satur day. They were outplayed. The after noon began well for the Herd in their first contest of the season. After losing the toss, Ken Durr '82 booted the opening kickoff deep into the UConn end- zone. Husky running back Joe Addison returned Durr's kick to his own 24 where he fumbled. Sophomore Glen MacGibbon recovered for Bucknell. A Geoff Gallo '82 run into the middle followed by a 17-yard touchdown strike from quarter back A1 Locey '83 to Ken Jenkins '82 put the Herd on the board first. Junior Bill Grennon's point- after was good. Score: Bisons 7, UConn 0. Total time elapsed: 52 seconds. It was easy; perhaps too easy. "" I thought that the first score was too quick, too fast,""  commented Head Coach Bob Curtis. The crowd of 7,670 Huskie fans watched in quiet disbelief as Durr prepared to kick off a second time. The silence at Memorial Stadium in Storrs quickly turned to screaming, however, as UConn drove deep into Bison territory. The drive stalled when linebacker Pat Paro '82 came up with a Huskie fumble, saving at least 3 points for the Herd. Several exchanges followed before Locey, the talented but in experienced quarterback, threw Photo-- John Rosenlieb"
Ken Durr '82 shows his punting form in Thursday's practice.,
Durr's 41.3-yard average was one of the few bright spots in,
the Herd's otherwise gloomy 38-7 loss to UConn.,"the first of his four interceptions of the afternoon. The Huskies then took ad vantage by quickly, advancing in to field goal range. A facemask penalty against Bucknell ac counted for a good portion of UConn's yardage. Two plays later Bob Segar split the uprights on a 40 yard kick which cut the Bison's lead to 7-3. The second quarter opened with another exchange of posses sion. Faced with a third-and-nine situation on his own 26 yard line, UConn quarterback Ken Sweitzer dropped back to pass. In what was probably the Bisons' most outstanding defen sive play of the game, outside linebacker Jeff Miller '82 in tercepted the ball in a crowd but was quickly brought down. The Herd was unable to capitalize, however, as Gren non's 36-yard field goal attempt was blocked. Sweitzer then led the Huskies on a nine-play, 80 yard scoring drive capped by a 13-yard touchdown toss to Joe Markus. The remainder of the second quarter was characterized by poor execution and frequent er rors by both teams. Bucknell fumbled three times, recovering once, while Locey threw his se cond interception. The Bisons managed to get the ball back twice on interceptions by defen sive backs Doug Smoot '82 and Jim Gush '81. Although his team trailed 10-7 at the half, Coach Curtis felt that "" it was anybody's ballgame."" The events of the third quarter proved to be crucial to the con test. Halfway through the period Sweitzer spotted a hole in the Bison secondary and hit Markus on a 31 yard pass play that gave the Huskies a first down on the Bison 22 yard line. The strange occurrence that followed proved fatal to the Herd."

Quarterback Al Locey '83 hands off to sophomore halfback,
Marshall Hall in drills preparing for Saturday's home opener,
against Slippery Rock.,"After the Bisons held for two plays, UConn set up in a passing formation with 12 men on the field. Bison coach Gene Depew spotted the infraction from the press box, but with the phones dead, he was unable to relay his message to the officials. Sweitzer threw a 20 yard pass to Rusty Umberger on the Bison two yard line. No flag was thrown on the play. Thirty seconds later the Bisons were on the short end of a 17-7 score. Curtis called it "" the play that turned the tide. That was the ball game right there. We had a tremendous letdown right at that point."" With the momentum in their favor, the Huskies dominated the remainder of the game, scoring three more touchdowns in the final period. The story of the Bison's defeat is the fact that their total time of possession amounted to less than 24 minutes. Curtis commented, "" You just can't keep the defense on the field for that much time."" The Huskies exploited "" a definite weakness in the middle of the defense""  while utilizing an effective passing game. Several key Bison personnel left the game with injuries while some others played with an acute virus. Moreover, six turnovers on first down thwarted the Bison of fensive effort. Curtis concluded, "" We were not as ready physically and mentally as we should have been."" The football team will face Slip pery Rock State College in their home opener tomorrow at 1:30 p.m. The contest will mark the first-ever meeting of the two teams. For a preview, see page 21 ."
Grieb cites teamwork and spirit,
as crucial to volleyball success,"By LOUISE BRISTOL There is nowhere to go but up for the women's volleyball team. After finishing their third varsity season at 4-12, coach Terrie Grieb feels the team will be much improved. Grieb is enthusiastic about the upcoming season, stating, "" We could do well if we learn to play together. We don't communicate enough yet and we need to work on control."" Only two players were lost to graduation and the freshmen are promising, leading Grieb to comment that, "" We have much more ability on the court than in the past."" Also expected to see varsity action are Sue Atkin son '81, Denise Cohen '83 and Janet Rankin '84. Atkinson was abroad last fall but played as a sophomore and Cohen is a first year member of the team who played for the women's softball team last spring. Rankin "" has shown a lot of hustle""  in prac tice sessions, according to Grieb. The other women competing for the final spots are junior Carolyn Weeks, sophomores Ann Novasatka, Carol Schmidt and Alison Wellington, and freshman Karen Tamow. Seniors Nina Kaminsky and Laura Kinney and freshman Kathleen Spear are all presently injured. Returning starters are captain Susan Bairstow '81 and Katie Hale '83. Bairstow is an outstanding hitter in her fourth year on the squad. Hale and freshman Laura Medalie will both play regularly and are still battling for the starting setter spot. Joining Medalie as the only starting freshman will be Kathleen Eckert. Jeanne Groeneveld '83, who is making the switch from field hockey to volleyball, will also start.

Report says bookstore like a,
drugstore; poor selection cited,By
DAVID HAWKINGS,
and MADELON HENEHAN,"Alterations in the physical ap pearance and management policies at the University Bookstore have begun following publication of a report calling for the store to change its ""Rea and Derick"" appearance. Besides criticizing the store's look as similar to the drugstore chain, the report by The Book store Advisory Committee also ask the University administration to help remedy the situation by making a ""financial commit ment"" of $30,000 annually to improve the book department at the store--especially its collec tion of ""quality"" books in academic disciplines. The yearly purchase of these books--which are traditional money losers--should be absor bed by a decrease in the rent the store pays the University for space in the University Center. The publication by the com mittee, a six-member faculty group chaired by Assistant Professor of Classics Barbara Shailor, was made public Sept. 8 but was originally sent to University President Dennis O'Brien in March. While the faculty's principal criticism of the store both in general and in the report has been an inadequate book depart ment, students' complaints have traditionally been the fear of being ""ripped off."" ""As far as we can see,"" said Associate Professor of English and committee member Philip Withim, ""this has never been the case."" The finds of the report agree with the results of an in vestigation by the Bucknellian in March of the bookstore's financial procedures. It was the long-standing criti cism from the faculty that prompted. O'Brien to create the special committee, members said. They published as an appen dix a list of 13 complains about the store which members said ""have been heard around the store for 20 years."" A chief faculty complaint was the ""emphasis on entertainment, best-sellers, science fiction mysteries and write-in yourself books at $5 each,"" the publica tion said. ""There's just too much plain junk"" at the bookstore, it said. University Bookstore Manager Warren Elze said this week the committee and faculty ""must realize this is a bookstore and not a library. The store is not for the faculty."" But Shailor said in a separate interview the bookstore ""should"

8,"By DAVID O'CONNELL Greek Weekend 1980 has already seen two events occur, with the main festivities tomorrow. This is the second year Greek Week end has been held in its current format. Co-sponsored by the Interfraternity and Panhellenic Councils, the purpose of Greek Weekend is to raise money for chairty as well as to provide a good time for students, according to Donn Zacune '81, publicity chairman of the IFC. Thursday nights Swim-for-Cancer resulted in nearly $2,000 in pledges. Sixty swimmers, nearly twice the number who participated last year, entered the event. Fifteen teams were entered, representing fraternities, sororities and six freshmen halls. Teams competed on the basis of total money pledged, and the winners received extra points towards the overall cham pionship. Winning teams in the event were first, Kappa Kappa Gamma, 40 points; second, Delta Delta Delta, 30 points and third, Phi Kappa Psi, 20 points. Each entering team received 10 points. Wednesday night's Greek Weekend banner contest saw 10 entries, each of"
v,"whom received six points. Judges named Pi Beta Phi's banner as the winner and awarded 20 points. Second was Phi Gamma Delta and Beta Gamma, who split 14 points, and Sigma Alpha Mu took 10 points for their third place entry.

Student leaders seeking academic credit,* I1 * 1.1 >> _____ >>nm nklnt nn tho AWV fnrrnp :
JOHN DZURINKO,"By STEVE HABETZ Officers for the ABS are seeking academic credits for the duties they perform and the student government leaders are also looking for students to fill two new paid positions in the ABS. ""We're looking for maybe two academic * credits per year,"" said ABS President John Dzurinko '81. ""We feel that this is justifiable when you take into consideration the time in volved, the nature of the activity and the potential impact as far as benefit for the en tire Bucknell community,"" he added. Dzurinko said that, ""the program could be supplemented with readings pertinent to the issues or subject matter handled by each of ficer. For example, the treasurer could be given readings on finance. This type of pro gram could become a practical vehicle for conveying theory for the student to learn. We think this would better prepare students for similar work in the future.' Dzurinko would like to see academic credits made available for students filling the ABS of fices of president, vice president and treasurer. Two paid positions are also now being of fered by the ABS. publicity director and inter collegiate coordinator. The ABS currently has one paid employee, a part-time secretary. The addition of the two jobs will involve an expenditure of about $700 a year, but Dzurinko said, ""We see the benefits far outweighing the expense."" The jobs will be paid for out of ABS funds which originate from the student activities fee. The duties of the publicity director, Dzurinko said, ""will include informing students of opportunities available through student government, putting together an ex- planatory pamphlet on the ABS tor tne admis sions office and making press releases, in ad dition to standard publicity."" The inter-collegiate coordinator, ""will be in charge of sharing new ideas with student associations at other schools in an effort to improve the ABS and become more involved with the national student movement,"" Dzurinko said. The jobs are available to anyone on student aid and will pay minimum wage. Dzurinko, in explaining the advantages of creating paid positions, said that ""many students who would be interested in doing this type of work are working in the cafeteria and bookstore in order to meet their financial obligations to the University. We felt that by adding the finan cial incentive we would get a larger selection and be able to find the persons most suited for the positions."""
Student bicyclist struck,
while crossing Route 15,"By LISA CERUTI Mary McNemey '81 was struck by a car Tuesday night while riding her bicycle across Route 15 at Moore Ave. She suffered a skull fracture and is reported to be in serious condition in the in tensive care unit of Geisinger Medical Center. The accident occurred at 8:45 p.m. as McNemey crossed from the east side of Route 15 toward the mods. The light was red for cars travelling on Route 15. One car was stopped at the light when William Belsky of Lewisburg, driving a 1976 Granada, ap proached the intersection and hit McNemey while she was in the crosswalk. An ambulance was called from the scene of the accident and ar rived within minutes, followed by Campus Security and East Buf falo Township police. McNemey was taken to Evangelical Com munity Hospital for treatment of severe head injuries and later transported to the Geisinger Medical Center in Danville for more extensive care. Norman Fine, Chief of Campus Security, said that upon his ar rival, McNemey showed no signs of paralysis. Fine commented that ""ambulance response was excellent."" According to John Dunlop, dean of student affairs, who was called to the accident site, the ac cident appeared to be the driver's fault. Dunlop described Belsky as ""an older gentleman"" and said that he ""allegedly ran the red light."" Capt. Auten of the East Buffalo Township Police Department stated that the^accident ""was not deliberate."" Belsky was cited for a traffic signal violation and fined $25 plus $10 in costs. In addi tion, McNemey was cited for fail ing to equip her bike with reflec tors and a light. A crossing signal for pedes trians at the site was not working at the time of the accident, ac cording to Capt. Auten."

Elze also denounced the 13- point list of criticisms, calling it ""trash and nonsense."" He denied the store had what the Shailor committee called ""inadequate academic and scholarly trade stock"" and ""poor displaying of various academic disciplines of literature."" The report was not objective and did not have ""enough con structive ideas to make it valuable,"" Elze said. To help solve problems not yet rectified at the store--especially another com plaint of inadequate art supplies, classical records and scores and ""inadequate knowledge of art, music and literature on the part of the staff, including top management""--O'Brien in June appointed Associate Professor of Music Jackson Hill as a faculty liaison with the bookstore. Hill will also institute a system of representatives from each academic department to pick titles for a ""new"" book department at O'Brien's request. He is also expected to issue his own ""memo"" , this week listing another set of recom mendations for improvement. Many of the ""cosmetic changes"" the 16-page report called for were instituted this summer as part of the effort to change what the committee called the ""mall, boutique"" at mosphere to one ""appropriate for a strong institution of learning and education."

Elze said he had been ""toying with these ideas""--all of which were specified in the report--for the past three years. ""This may be true,"" Shailor said, adding she hoped^ her committee's work would ""push forward"" the other changes asked for as well.

Lectureship sponsors^Justice'symposium,
Wooden speaks on children's,
rights in final,
',
J lecture,"By TRICIA KENNEDY Ken Wooden, speaking in the Vaughan Literature Auditorium Thursday night, raised the ques tion, ""W ho shall plead for the helpless?"" W ooden's lecture, entitled, "" Justice for Children: A Time for Advocacy,"" was the last in a symposium on "" Justice in Am erica"" sponsored by the Bucknell Student Lectureship Committee. W ooden is the author o f W eeping in the Playtime of Others, a book which deals with the subject of child advocacy. In addition, W ooden has worked for several years in vestigating juvenile justice as a reporter for CBS "" Sixty Min utes"" and NBC News. He is now a special correspondent for the Chicago Sun Times. Thursday's lecture was sparse ly attended. Its subject was the exploitation of juveniles by the U.S. legal system. Wooden called for legislation to protect the rights of so-called ""status offen ders"" --juveniles who are run aways, truants, or are simply considered to be "" incorrigible"" by their parents and the courts. Wooden named several instan ces o f abuse he has uncovered as a reporter investigating reform schools across the country. In one Texas institution, Wooden said children were put in solitary confinement for steal ing crackers, or ""acting up"" in class. Often gas cannisters were rolled into the cells to ""calm"" the children. Such offenses continue to oc cur, Wooden said, because of a lack o f ""adult interest and com mitment in juvenile justice."" He blamed politicians in particular for ignoring the issue o f in stitutional reform, claiming that most o f them are more con cerned with the advancement of their careers than with child welfare. Wooden said that conditions in retirement homes are given top priority by politicians be cause the elderly tend to have a high voter turnout. ""Kids do not vote,"" he noted. Corruption in state govern ment is stalling reform in the juvenile justice system Wooden urged the audience to get involved in the cause of child advocacy. Noting that ""the press does more to protect children than legislation does,"" he named three ways in which a citizen could report a case of in stitutional child abuse: Mail an anonymous tip to a reporter or editor; provide background infor mation on the story, working with the reporter but retaining your anonymity; "" go public"" -- come out with your information in the form o f a letter or article, and lobby for legislative reform. Wooden is currently working on a book which will cover the sexual abuse of children."

Attorney William Kunstler speaks Monday night in the Davis,
Gymnasium. He was the keynote speaker of the Bucknell,
Student Lectureship's symposium:,
"""Justice in America.""",
denounces,"By JAN BALAKIAN Nationally renowned attorney William Kunstler launched a three day symposium entitled "" Justice in America""  in a lecture here Monday night. His speech, delayed one hour due to his involvement in a murder case in New York City, prompted 25 percent of the au dience to leave, according to an official of the Bucknell Student Lectureship, sponsors of the pro gram. Kunstler spoke of "" flagrant in justices imposed on outlaws,"" those whom he defined as "" lack ing rights because they are out side the law."" "" Blacks and people from third world countries have always been outlaws,"" Kunstler said. He expounded on the plight of blacks, which he said he is "" heavily familiar with."" Citing examples of "" perversions of law,""  he pointed to the recent case of McDuffie, a black in surance salesman who was at tacked in Miami by white policemen. The officers were subsequently acquitted. Kunstler said that "" there is no need for an FBI.""  He outlined a pending bill in Congress, the FBI Charter Act of 1979. This bill would legitimize murder as a law enforcement mechanism, Kunst ler said, adding that it would authorize the FBI to probe into anyone's personal affairs. He also spoke of the FBI's lethal action regarding blacks, citing the case of Jeanne Seberg, who accompanied Jane Fonda to a Black Panther fund raising meeting in Los Angeles. "" She was killed by the FBI as sure as if they put the gun to her head and pulled the trigger,"" Kunstler said. He compared the alleged FBI fabrication - of a newspaper article to the fabrica tions that victimized Christ. The article stated that Seberg had been impregnated by a Black Panther. Seberg was so upset by the FBI's actions that she killed herself,""  Kunstler said. Kunstler also spoke of former FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover's "" heinous conduct.""  He said that Hoover, on one occasion, had termed Martin Luther King "" the biggest liar in America and the most dangerous Negro."" Kunst ler said that Hoover held the dangerous assumption that the end justifies the means. Although Kunstler did not give any specific solutions, he told the audience to "" protest injustice, to become less diverted, to escape the quietude of which we all have become victims.""  He reminisced about the decade of the 60's. "" The sixties were alive, vibrant, altruistic,"" Kunstler said. "" College troops stopped the Viet nam War."" Kunstler said he sees a very rough decade ahead, with a great deal of oppression on the local level.

Hostilities increase,
between Iran-Iraq,"Fighting between Iraq and Iran has intensified since early September when Iraq seized 90 square miles of Iranian territory. Hostilities, derived in part from Iran's attempt to impose its culture on Iraqis^ have culminated in the cessation of all oil exports from the Persian Gulf by both countries. Iraq has attacked Iran's'huge oil refinery at Abadan, and Iran has bombed the Iraqi capital of Baghdad and three oil installa tions. Both sides report renewed air raids on oil centers, and the Ira qis say they have bombed Iranian oil storage tanks on Kharg"
"Island,","an oil loading terminal. President Carter said the United States and all other coqii- tries should maintain neutrality and said he supported interna tional efforts to end the fighting. Interruption of oil shipments from Iraq and Iran will not hinder American economic security, Carter said. Carter's primary concern is to keep the Strait of Hormuz open as sixty percent of the oil in the world's international trade passes through this strait. ' If escalating hostilities en danger oil exports from other Persian Gulf countries, like Saudi Arabia, it is expected that Carter will seek international interven tion."

9 megaton warhead,
to be inspected,
A,"nine-megaton nuclear warhead was sent to Pantex ' Nuclear Weapons Assembly Plant near Amarillo, Texas, for analysis. It was accidentally ejected from a Titan 2 missile Friday. According to a defense depart- m6nt official, there was no radia tion leakage as a result of the ex plosion. One airman was killed in the accident and 21 others were in jured. At least 1,400 area residents were forced to evacuate their homes. Technicians opened the warhead and poured an oil mix ture into it before moving it, in an effort to neutral its detonator. The Air Force Mishap In vestigation Board, which authorized the missile site, may take up to two months to deter mine why a fuel leak led to the sudden explosion."

"CPI, inflation rise",
during August 80,"The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported the Consumer Price In dex for the month of August in creased by seven-tenths of one percent and the larger increases are likely in September. If this rate continued for a year, it would produce an an nual inflation rate of 8.6 percent. The rise of inflation was substantial but only half as much as the rises of 1.4 percent in each of the first three months of 1980. # r Higher prices for fresh food, and for new and used cars and houses drove the index up in August. . Officials of the Bureau of J Labor Statistics and Agriculture forecast sustained food price in creases in upcoming months.

Bookstore stops,
Rely tampon sales,"Rely tampons, a product of the Procter & Gamble Co., were removed from the shelves of the University Bookstore Tuesday following a voluntary recall by the manufacturer Monday, ac cording to David Reich, assistant manager for operations at the store. Although no official word was received from the manufacturer, Reich said, a decision was made Tuesday based on certain ""media reports"" to discontinue the sale of this product. These media reports, one of which appeared on the front page of Tuesday's New York Times, presented the fin dings of government studies con cluding that the use of Rely tam pons increases the risk of developing toxic shock syn drome. This disorder is a serious affliction that can prove fatal. Approximately 50 million American women use tampons and, according to a spokesman for the National Center for Disease Control, any of these women has th e ' potential to develop TSS (toxic shock syn drome). For some reason, however, Rely seems to heighten that chance. As yet unconfirmed theories state that Rely's ab so rb a n c y  ag en t, carbox- ymethylcellulose, might in fact be a breeding ground for TSS bacterium. Any woman who has purchased this product from the bookstore will be permitted to return it for a refund. Rely was distributed with the Good Stuffs box received by Bucknell women at the beginning of the year."

Frosh election results close;,
2 students tie in one contest,"By ALLISON ABOUCHAR and DAVID HAWKINGS In the only disputed contest among the 16 elections for ABS Congressional representatives Tuesday, Steve Garfinkel and Noreen Walsh tied in the race for Class of '84 secretary/treasurer with 107 votes each. The 45 percent of the class that went to the polls -- less than the percentage of freshman voting last year -- also elected Dan Huck as president and Scooter Hoermer vice president with 153 and 158 votes, respectively. Huck defeated Michael Con cordia by 24 votes, while Hoerr- ner had nearly double the votes tallied by Nick Badami. According to ABS President John Dzurinko '81,32 ballots from freshmen men were nearly declared invalid when Dzurinko discovered these ballots contain ed votes for dorm represen tatives from both Trax and Kress Halls. Election rules state that University students may only vote for representatives in the building in which they live. Vice President for Administra tion and Finance John Zeller -- who also serves as the Universi ty's general counsel -- ruled Wednesday that only the dor mitory representative portions of the ballot should be disqualified. Zeller was asked to rule on the dispute by Dzurinko. Had he ruled that the entire ballot was in error, 19 votes per- t a i n i n g t o t h e s e c r e - tary/treasurer contest would have been eliminated, and Gar finkel would have edged Walsh for the position by one vote, 98 to 97. After the vice president's rul ing, Dzurinko counted the ballots three more times. Twice his count produced a tie, and so the draw was declared. ABS Vice President Pete Fran- cino '81 -- who is charged in the by-laws of the ABS with running the body's elections -- did not participate in the final count. In order to resolve the tie, Dzurinko asked that the two can didates decide for themselves how to split the responsibilities of the office. Garfinkel and Walsh decided Wednesday to serve respectively as treasurer and secretary of the class. Walsh said she was "" happy with the results."" Gunnar Armstrong and Marty Pflegger were elected to repre sent Trax Hall, David Grossman and John Held beat three other candidates to represent Kress Hall, Tricia Kennedy and Sue Stanley won the Roberts Hall post and Trevy O'Leary won an uncontested election in Harris Hall in the contests for freshman dormitory representatives to the ABS Congress.

CCM and Swartz Dorm Council: Mass controversy,"_ . . . . . .. n . ______ 11.. I k i. moc c ta n r ia r r i n r p c p n t s t h o r p h v narflnt that the SDC is  COIT To the Editor: 1 should like to offer some per sonal comment on an issue of con siderable importance to the Bucknell community, keeping the following caveat in mind: "" Men who fight about religion have no religion to fight about since they do in the name of religion the thing which religion itself forbids."" j oseph fort Newton On Thursday, the Catholic Campus Ministry proposed to the Swartz Dorm Council the follow ing: that an open Roman Catholic Mass be held in one of the Swartz lounges on a given Thursday evening in the hope that residents of all creeds might feel free to celebrate, to investigate, and to share in a ritual of mutual acknowledgement of God. It was further proposed that CCM and the SDS co-sponsor an open study break for all Swartz dorm residents following the Mass. It was hoped that such a study break would serve both as an overtly hedonistic social event (gasp!) and as an open forum for the exchange of ideas. In this manner CCM sought to foster an environment which possessed both redeeming educational and social qualities that would per tain directly to the interests of Bucknell students. In considering this proposal it should be noted that CCM intend ed neither to proselytize, pon tificate, nor unilaterally pro pound. The propogation of the faith is for surer souls. Regrettably, the SDC rejected this proposal, stating that it would only consider c o sponsorship of an event which was not initiated by any single religious group. Apparently this decision was predicated upon the belief that the sponsorship of one special in terest group would, by implica tion, obligate the dorm council to co-sponsor events with other such groups. Perhaps a separation of religion and governance seemed appropriate here in order to pre vent inequitable or differential treatment of groups because of their respective ideologies. I have no doubt that the members of the SDC invoked these principles in order to pre vent setting a dangerous prece dent which they thought could possibly lead to any number of undesirable consequences. Yet is is sadly ironic that in so attemp ting to save Bucknell from religious intolerance, they have unknowingly become caught in a 'Kantian dilemma.' The SDC has adhered to a set of"
Beer is not the focal point,"... , __ j"

_,".t  ,,,,nncnroH festivities cUsaDDoi To the Editor: In last week's Bucknellian, there appeared two articles regarding the University alcohol policy and its effect on this 1980 Greek Weekend. I respect and understand the Bucknellian's in terest in the new, controversial 'interpretation of the University's alcohol policy and I also ap preciate the Bucknellian's con cern for the success of Greek Weekend. However, beer is not the focal point of Greek Weekend. Greek Weekend is an event sponsored by the Interfraternity and Panhellenic Councils to bring in dividuals and groups from the campus and surrounding com munity together to compete in games, take part in a carnival benefitting a philanthropy, swim for cancer, run for prizes and to basically have a good time. The fact that last week's editorial article assumed that the alcohol policy would "" confine and limit in size"" the carnival at mosphere of the Greek Weekend standard precepts, thereby preserving an ideal, but when these precepts prevent the realization of the ideals they so actively seek to protect, something mustjje said. The CCM proposed their Mass/study break, I think, for four main reasons: to recognize that no single faith possesses a monopoly on religious truth; to bring a sense of God back into our homes, the historical centers of worship in all Judeo-Christian religions; to foster a sense of good will and table fellowship among all people; and to actively attack the spectre of religious in tolerance and discrimination through an informal, voluntary program of interfaith interaction. Given that the reasons enumerated above are, in fact, consistent with CCM's intents and purposes, it should be ap- parent that the SDC is correct but only in a prima facie way. They have unknowingly upheld a stan dard to the exclusion of a similar equally valid standard. In this difficult case one cannot follow a set of abstract prin ciples, regardless of their ap parent expediency, to the exclu sion of the potential conse- .quences they entail without an ticipating contradictory results. It seems to me that both groups had the same ends in mind. It is t r a g i c  t h a t  a m u t u a l misunderstanding has occurred. Rather than promote a dynamic interchange of ideas between students of varying faiths, the SDC has opted for a situation which can only enforce the unacceptable status quo of religious myopia in the Bucknell community. Michael F. Suarez '82"
Convince,
us,
you 're right,"To the Editor: I cannot let Richard Pisano's article condemning the economics and political science departments of "" collectivism"" and of using academic freedom "" to strike at the social and economic foundations of our society without opposition"" go unanswered. Pisano is certainly entitled to like the thought of Frederich Hayek if he wants to, but he is not entitled to say that unless there are faculty here who subscribe to that position the departments are hiring bad ly, the administration is failing the students, and where it counts, students are being presented with only one point of view. Of course anyone can claim that unless their particular view point has a spokesman on the faculty, they are being denied a balanced education. Anyone can make such a claim, but that fact alone reveals its vacuousness, which keeps most people, Pisano ex cepted, from doing so. . . .  ,, . . If Pisano is serious, let him try to convince us that Hayek is right. That would be respectable. What he wrote is not. deg Ernest Keen Professor of psychology festivities disappoints me. Beer is a nice extra as are the food and birch beer which will be served. I would hate to think that without the beer the weekend would not be a success. In the future, I ask that the Bucknellian, and anyone for that matter, take notice of the positive services of Greek Weekend and not just the alcohol aspect often associated with all Greek events. Steve Kohn '81 IFC president"
Student cries for more coverage,"To the Editor: A disservice was done last week in the Bucknellian's reporting of the debut of Christy's Gate. While a uniquely innovative special event was being unveiled to the Bucknell campus, the Bucknellian chose to concentrate on the increasing ly mundane topics of beer and Greek life, along with the dramatic (or melodramatic) reorganization of campus security. Surely these stories cannot possibly match the excitement of a student organization volunteering inordinate amounts of time, energy, money and car ing to bring Bucknell a new and refreshing alter native to fraternities and the Bison. The impact of Christy's Gate cannot alone be measured by the 700-plus students, faculty and ad ministrators who enjoyed excellent food, a relaxed atmosphere, entertainment and friendly service. Instead, the meaning of the event must be concen trated on in order to understand its significance. Representing a profound deviation from both Greek abandon andjgoffee house theatrics. .kAiIS. Christy's Gate has opened new doors of social enjoy ment that stress relaxed conversation in a pub at mosphere. Even allowing for the demanding deadlines of a publication like the Bucknellian, surely the editors can recognize the significance of such an event and do the campus a service by appropriate coverage. With this in mind, an apology is due to those scores of students who helped with Christy's Gate. It is this kind of activity, concentrating on bringing people together for stimulating conversation, relaxation and good music in an intimate atmosphere that will lift Bucknell out of its decadent, self-destructive cApio] ctmrturp Hopefully, Christy's Gate and new ideas like it will not be one-time events but will continue to breathe new life into the Bucknell experience. In order for this to happen, student, faculty, and ad ministrative support will have to be developed in concert to an extent not demonstrated in last week's Bucknellian. I hope we are up to the task."

Goals of fraternity life are exam,
By,
LYNNE RUTHERFORD,
"On Monday, fraternity rush began once",
again. The familiar sight of freshmen hall,
"groups parading down fraternity row,",
briefly entering each house along the way,
and sometimes stumbling home a few,
hours later has becopie a campus rite of,
fall. Although it sometimes seems as if,
fraternities exist only to improve the,
"social life of their members, the reasons",
and purposes behind rush are many.,
"""Everyone has different reasons for",
"Joining a fraternity, whether it be for beer,",
"friendship or just a better place to live,""",
"said Steve Kohn '81, Interfraternity Coun",
cil president and a member of Sigma Phi,
Epsilon fraternity.,
"This year, over 75% of first year men",
paid a $2.00 registration fee and prepared,
for the trek down fraternity row. Kohn said,
many more were expected to register late,
for rush. By the time rush is over in,
"November, Kohn estimated that over 95%",
of the freshmen class will attend at least,
one rush party.,
Kohn and several other IFC members,
compiled an outline stating the main ad,
vantages of rush from a fraternity's point,
of view. Prominent among them were the,
"development of leadership potential, op",
"portunity for community service and, of",
"course, increased social life.",
Among the better known philanthrophic,
activities of campus fraternities are Delta,
"Upsilon's Demie play, Sigma Chi's Sig",
"Derby, and Phi Psi 500, sponsored by Phi",
Kappa Psi. Fraternities engage in many,
lesser known charity events as well. The,
"IFC believes these activities, as well as",
numerous posts of responsibility within the,
"fraternities themselves, combine to give",
members important leadership and,
management skills.,
"Significantly, brotherhood remains the",
primary purpose of the fraternity. They,
seek not only to provide companionship,
"during the college years, but lifelong",
friendships as well.,
"Rush is divided into two segments, for",
"mal and informal. Formal rush, which",
"took place for four days this week, provid",
ed an opportunity for freshmen to get a,
first glimpse of fraternity life and the in,
"side of the Greek houses. Informal rush,",
"spread over seven weeks, is when brothers",
and rushees become acquainted with each,
other in earnest.,
Formal rush retains the glossy at,
mosphere of fraternity girlfriends and lit,
tle sisters registering and pinning name,
"tags on freshmen, while some fraternal",
"brothers are dressed in suits and ties, all to",
make the best impression.,
"""Fraternities feel they have to put on",
"airs during formal rush,"" said Bruce",
"Bowen '82, rush chairman of Lambda Chi",
"Alpha. ""Informal rush is much more",
"natural.""",
"""During formal rush everyone seems to",
"put on an image,"" freshman Rob Pohls",
likewise observed.,
Most fraternity members agreed with,
"this, and several mentioned the Monday",
night football parties as especially useful,
"in getting to know rushees better. ""Those",
that show up on Monday night are usually,
fairly interested in the house. We're all in,
"one room, watching the game, and it's a",
"good atmosphere,"" said Paul Rasmussen,",
co-rush chairman of DU.,
"Kohn echoed these sentiments, saying",
"that the seven weeks provided ""plenty of",
time for a relaxed rush. The pressure is,
"off.""",
The goals of each fraternity are as,
diverse as the organizations themselves.,
Different fraternities stress different,
elements of the Greek scene. Some are,
"hoping to expand this year, some to re",
main stable in size.,
"""Often fraternities are intentionally",
kept small because the brothers like a,
closeknit house. Too often people assume,
that smallness means a fraternity is un,
"popular,"" Kohn said.",
"""We'll be working more for the brothers",
during rush than worrying about attrac,
ting lots of people. If the brothers are hav,
"ing a good time at a party, everyone else",
"probably is too,"" said Joe Ruskiewicz '82,",
president of Phi Lambda Theta.,
"""We're not overly concerned with",
numbers. We want people that will be an,
"asset to the house,"" Bowen said of Lambda",
"Chi, which last spring lost more than one",
third of its membership due to reorganiza,
tion by a national LCA review board. Ac,
"cording to Bowen, LCA is ""smaller and",
strong,
Our strength comes from within,
"the brotherhood, and we'll be seeking out",
"people that can aid it.""",
"Similarly, other fraternities are looking",
for new members that will effectively run,
"the house's activities. ""We hope to attract",
people that are interested in supplemen,
ting their academic life with fraternity liv,
"ing. In other words, having a good time is",
"important, but so is responsibility,"" said",
"Tom Jackson '82, rush chairman of Theta",
Chi. His thoughts were shared by many,
"other rush chairmen, including co-",
chairman Doug Conners of DU.,
"""We're looking for anywhere between 20",
and 30 people that can contribute to the,
house and get something out of it. In selec,
"ting members, we look for freshmen that",
would be the future leaders of the house,
"and are able to sustain its reputation,""",
Conners said.,
"""Our main goal is to get SAM back on its",
"feet,"" said Chris Hartnett, '83 rush chair",
"man of Sigma Alpha Mu. Last week, Hart",
nett and five other members of the class of,
"'83 pledged SAM, raising its total member",
"ship to eleven. ""We saw the rooms last",
"year and wanted to live downhill, but we're",
also very interested in building up the,
"fraternity,"" Hartnett continued.",
"In the future, the brothers of SAM hope",
to be able to fill their house entirely with,
"members of the fraternity. Presently, the",
house is owned by the university and con,
tains a number of independents.,
Few changes are being instituted in rush,
this year. Several fraternities expressed,
the desire to hold more events outside of,
"the house, such as football and basketball",
games between brothers and rushees. In,
general fraternities were pleased with last,
year's results -- with a few exceptions.,
"""A trend away from alcohol would be",
great. If its importance could be minimiz,
"ed, better communication between",
"rushees and brothers would result,"" said",
Ken Wolckenhauer '82 of Sigma Alpha Ep,
silon.,
Whatever the advantages of fraternity,
"rush, there are disadvantages too. ""In",
"general, by having rush first semester,",
fraternities fracture the male freshman,
class. Rushees immediately take on the,
personality of the fraternity they're in,
"terested in,"" said Bill Thum '82, a member",
of the university's Complimentary Ac,
"tivities Committee. The committee,",
"elected last year through the ABS, in",
vestigated fraternity and sorority rushing,
practices.,
"""Freshmen are quickly pushed into",

Another view common among in dependents is that belonging to a fraterni ty just isn't really necessary. ""I didn't feel the need to join. It hasn't hurt my social life any.

--,By TODD G. BUCHHOLZ
Squeezed between a week of,
justice in America and a weekend,
"of Bacchus and Budweiser, I'd",
like to make some connections,
between the two.,
The University has chosen this,
year as the year of the teetotaler,
and is honoring this rare breed of,
bison by enforcing rules on drink,
ing in the dorms.,
Someone apparently dug up the,
time capsule of 1920 and read the,
"University policy stating ""The",
consumption,
of,
alcoholic,
beverages is prohibited in the,
main public rooms and similar,
common areas of the residence,
"h alls.. . """,
"Bury it again. It is incredible,",
"unrealistic,",
counterproductive,
and unjust.,
"Presumably, the purpose of the",
code is to prevent drunken,
Bucknellians from tripping over,
chairs and punching out win,
dows. The University takes a,
great insurance risk every time,
someone reaches for some gusto.,
Admittedly this is a problem.,

How do we solve it?,
"First, what not to do. Do not",
"ban kegs from halls, yet allow",
them in dorm rooms. You don't,
need a mechanical engineering,
"degree to lift a keg, move it from",
the hall into a room and then,
dispense beer. Are 50 students in,
a cubicle preferable and less,
hazardous than 50 students in a,
hall? It sounds like good training,
for,
a,
telephone-booth-stuffing,
team.,
"Second, don't invoke policies",
that will force people into the,
frats if they want a drink.,
One day the administration,
seeks alternatives to Greek par,
ties and the next day they em,
phasize an important feature of a,
private fraternity house -- access,
to alcohol.,
I have been informed by an ad,
ministration,
official that,
no,
students,
are,
attracted,
here,
"because of fraternities, yet many",
are,
discouraged,
by,
their,
predominance. Keep that in mind,
as,
high,
school,
enrollment,
declines.,
Obviously the new measures,
are counterproductive.,
What to do? Responsibility and,
accountability are the answer.,
The,
University,
must,
hold,
students accountable for their ac,
"tions, whether committed when",
sober or drunk.,
If the regime in Marts Hall,
wants us to learn to drink and,
"handle ourselves as adults, they",
should treat us and punish us as,
adults.,"4 a olpnhnl a a u lw . ^ M,|n p M>..>>>>MII>>UIIIIIIIIII*lllllll|l l Mllll<<H,llllll> lt> ,llt,l,l,lttllltitllll,lllllllllll,llltlllllllllllllllllE"

The next time some slob is,

"William Kunstler's ""victim of",

The University owes every stu,

Prohibition simply won't work.,
Ask Grandpa whether it stopped,
him from drinking when he was,
twenty.,
I regret the administration,
must divert its resources to deal,
with alcohol problems.,
The question of drinking at,
Bucknell is complex and incen,
diary. That so many need liquor,
to,
convince,
themselves that,
they're having a good time is un,
fortunate.,
That parties disintegrate as,
"soon as a keg ""kicks"" is sad.",
We can solve only one problem,
"at a time, however. And the",
University's solution to the issue,
of pickled and perilous bisons is,
tenuous and should be revised.,

Brubaker profound and,
"moving, but not realistic",
with portrayal of reform,"Thomas Murton, former pro fessor of criminal sciences and penology, always agreed with the eminent English political philoso pher Edmund Burke that ""the only thing essential for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing and remain silent."" When he became a pri son superintendent, he heard of and personally saw so many in justices committed that he had to do something. The experiences he went through serve loosely as a basis for [Brubaker], which follows the attempts of an idealistic warden to reform the prison system. The movie opens on a group of convicts being transported to the Wakefield State Penitentiary. With them is Robert Redford, clearly not just another prisoner. During the seemingly endless drive to the prison and the first few days of his residence there, he is a silent presence registering signs of corruption and respon ding to the numberous acts of unwarranted cruelty with an anguished, out-of-place com passion. The need for a tough but compassionate warden to clean up the running of Wakefield has been clearly demonstrated by the time Brubaker appears on the scene. It is shown in his segments to be a courageous man so determined to right the wrongs of the place that he is willing to enter the medieval tor ture chamber the prison is likened to as one of the power less and manipulated prisoners. Within a short time, Redford identifies himself as Henry Brubaker, Wakefield's new war den. In the scene before this revelation the audience receives a glimpse of the prison from the inside. The men are controlled by gun-carrying guards (prisoners trusted by the officials) who, in connivance with the profit-seek ing prison administration and board, supply prisoners to local farms and businesses as slave laborers, while stealing and hoarding the penitentiary's food for their personal use. The climax of the movie both dramtically and emotionally oc curs as Brubaker, not yet divested of his convict's dis guise, intervenes when a black prisoner breaks out of his death- row ""hole""--so called because the men imprisoned there are allowed into the sun only a few minutes each year--and attempts to strangle a younger man. The intensity of the situation captivates the audience, some thing that recurs throughout the entire movie and speaks well for the direction of Stuart Rosen- burg. Although moving and deeply affecting, the way the film it self is presented is sometimes unrealistic. The changes Brubaker affects are necessary and plausible ones, but their after- math is implausable. For in stance, he rails against the un cleanliness of the dining facili ties, and within minutes the kit chen is spotless and the prison ers are all smiling at each other. It is to be admitted that in a life filled with unending filth and degradation, convincingly shown in the opening scenes of the movie, any minor improve ment will bring elation, but this was overplayed in an unneces sary effort to win the audience to Brubaker's cause.

screenings at 7 and 9 p.m. every night.,"the prison, and perhaps all aspects of our society, will not improve because the community in which it rests is inherently corrupt. It alludes to the notion that evil is so encompassing even the mythical American hero is powerless to change it; though he does succeed in providing the prisoners with a tiny last glim mer of hope Brubaker fails in his efforts at prison reform. A stirring and deeply moving film, [Brubaker] leaves the audience with many profound questions to contemplate. The film opens tonight at the Campus Theater on Market Street."

Tennis is young & optimistic,
By,
JEANNE MINAHAN,"and JEFF CROSS The women's tennis team en ters its seven match fall season with a young squad that is ""anxious and optimistic,"" accord ing to coach Rose Ewan. The inexperienced Bisons have only two seniors and one junior on the squad that finished 2-4 last spring and 2-3 in last year's fall season. Ewan states, ""We hope to be guaranteed three of six singles matches, so the three doubles matches will be decisive."" However, Donna and Diana Burns, last season's first and third singles players, respectively, have graduated. Jumping up to the first singles position is sopho more Patty Koch. Koch, who Ewan cited as ""the most con sistent player on the team last year,"" had a 9-1 record in the third spot. Sarah Kreiger '83, a transfer student from Drew University, replaces senior co-captain Kirsten Schubauer in the second slot. Schubauer, who Ewan said, ""possesses nice deep strokes and a good cross court shot,"" drops to third. In the fourth spot will be sophomore Cindy Appel, who gained experience and confidence in summer tournaments. Senior co-captain Janice Huber remains in the fifth position. Huber won"

The three doubles tandems have yet to be determined, but will be comprised of the top six singles players, according to Ewan. The remaining women who will see action are junior Kathy Riker, sophomore Jan Balakian and freshmen Julie Fischer, Susan St. Clair, Lisa Smails and Ann Wilbur.

"Herd topples Slippery Rock, 25-6",
By STEVEN SKOLNICK and,
MICHAEL SUAREZ,
"The playbook calls it the ""121""",
-- a sweep to the right side. Last,
Saturday against Slippery Rock,
"the ""121"" worked beautifully all",
afternoon. With 4:21 remaining in,
"the second quarter, the Bison of",
fense executed this simple play,
perfectly.,
Quarterback A1 Locey '83 took,
"the snap, faked left to his fullback",
and handed off to Ken Jenkins,
'82. The junior workhorse fol,
lowed pulling weakside guard,
"Darren Ford '81 closely, and as",
the tandem found the seam,
"created by the offensive line,",
Jenkins cut upfield and ac,
celerated through the lane. When,
"he hit open ground, all of",
Memorial Stadium was on its feet,
while Jenkins outran the final two,
defenders on a 76-yard scoring,
sprint.,
The touchdown put the Bisons,
in front 19-0 on their way to a 25-6,
thrashing of the Rock. The score,
was typical of Bucknell's play as,
they scored on four of their first,
five possessions. Head Coach Bob,
"Curtis commented, ""We utilized",
a ball control offense that was,
systematically designed to keep,
"the defense off the field.""",
Bucknell kept the ball on the,
"ground,",
amassing,
259 yards,
"rushing from Jenkins, Geoff",
Gallo '82 and Marshall Hall '83.,
The,
Bisons,
established,
themselves early as they pound,
ed their way to the Rock one-yard,
line on their first possession. With,
a third-and-goal situation Locey,
hit paydirt when he plunged over,
the line on a QB keeper. Junior,
Bill Grennon's extra point was,
"good and Bucknell was on top,",
7-0.,
The Herd defense shut the Rock,
down on the next series when,
defensive back McKinley Norris,
intercepted a Chuck Sirko aerial,
and returned it two yards to the,
Slippery Rock 33. Four plays,
later Grennon booted a 44-yard,
field goal to make the score 10-0.,
The Bison defense continued to,
thwart Slippery Rock's offensive,
efforts through most of the se,
"cond quarter, totally stopping",
"their ground game. Curtis stated,",
''The defense played well against,
the run. The front four were very,
aggressive and the linebacking,
corps also did a good job against,
"K (tm)T X "" """,
Tlff arms a would be tackier in Saturday's home opener against Slippery,
Rock. Jenkins gained 156 yards in 17 carries and threw a 29-yard touchdown pass in the,
victory. The Herd amassed 315 yards of total offense.,
"the run.""",
Midway through the second,
"quarter, the Bisons took over on",
their own 34-yard line. Powered,
by the running of Jenkins and,
"Hall, the",
Orange,
and Blue,
marched deep into Rock ter,
"ritory. The drive stalled, but",
Grennon connected on his second,
"field goal of the day, a 34-yard ef",
fort that stretched the Bucknell,
lead to 13-0. Grennon's kicking ef,
forts earned him the honor of,
ECAC Division I-AA rookie of the,wgg K*
Jenkins',
touchdown,
"romp,",
"followed by a Rock score, closed",
the first half with the Herd in con,
trol by a 19-6 margin.,
"In the second half, the Bison of",
fense got off to a sluggish start as,
they failed to get a first down in,
their initial two possessions. With,
"a fourth down situation, Ken Durr",
'82 uncorked a 54-yard punt from,
deep inside his own territory.,
Daryl Cline '83 and Mike Thomp,
son '83 popped the Rock returner,
hard enough to jar the ball loose,
and Ed Zack '82 recovered the,
fumble on the Rock's 29-yardline.,
It only took one play for the,
Herd to reach the endzone.,
"Locey,",
"rolling to his right,",
pitched the ball to Jenkins on the,
halfback option. Jenkins saw Hall,

Bisons meet Brown,
By STEVEN SKOLNICK and,

The Bisons will take to the road Saturday as they square off against,
"Brown University in Providence, R.I., at 1:30 p.m.",
___,
"The Bruins, favored to capture the Ivy League title m many, P *",
"season polls, will be trying to recover from a 45-17 loss to Yale athome",
last Saturday. Brown rallied from a 24-6 deficit to cut the lead to 24-17,
with seven minutes remaining before Yale exploded for three late,
"SCBison Head Coach Bob Curtis commented, ""It's hard to evaluate",
"Brown's true performance"" because they had six turnovers and 10",
"penalties, but ""they are a very good offensive team.",
Leading Brown's multiple I modified pro set offense is last year s,
"All-Ivy League quarterback, Larry Carbone. Curtis remarked",
We 11,
"have a lot of trouble coping with him."" Carbone completed 19 of 3",
passes for 220 yards in the loss to Yale.,
",,",
.,
Carbone's favorite ball carrier is semor tailback Rick Villella who,
needs 319,
yards to become the all-time leading Brum rusher.,
Flanker Mitch Metz and tight end Steve Jordan should keep the,
Bison defensive secondary busy all afternoon.,
.,
.,
The Herd will have to keep constant pressure on Carbone in order to,
"win. Offensively, the Bisons must establish a running game early",
against Brown's 5-2 defense. Linebacker John Woodring and defensive,
back Jeff Gradinger are players to watch on the Bm n,
T h,
The Bucknell offensive line will miss the play of left tocWe John,

Spikers lose first 4 matches;,
Grieb sees improvement ahead,
Page 19,"By JEFF CROSS The women's volleyball team stumbled to an 0-4 start by losing a pair of tri-matches this week. Tuesday the Bisons traveled to Franklin and Marshall where they lost to the host Diplomats, 3-15, 14-16, 3-15. The win raised F&M 's record to 2-1. The spikers next challenged powerful Delaware. The Blue Hens were Division II regional champions last season and went to the NCAA championship tour nament. Coach Terrie Grieb noted, "" The girls felt we had nothing to lose and everything to gain."" Although it was their first match, Delaware's skill and ex perience was obvious in the first set as Bucknell fell 15-4. However, the Bisons' blocking improved and the spikers jumped out to an 11-6 lead in the second set. At this point, the Bisons "" fun damentally stopped talking and hustling,""  according to Grieb, and Delaware rallied to take the set 15-11. The Bisons also started fast in the third set, using dinks effec tively to gain an 8-5 lead. On the verge of a comeback, Grieb noticed, "" We began to com mit mental errors such as two people going for the same ball."" Delaware took advantage and overtook the Bisons, winning the final set 15-8. Grieb said, "" We should have won the second and third sets,"" but, "" the team played 85 percent better than on Saturday so the Delaware match was definitely a moral victory for us."" Delaware topped F&M in the the third match of the tri-match. Katie Hale '83 played well as setter while captain Susan Bairstow '81 and Ann Navasatka '83 blocked well at the net, ac cording to Grieb. On Saturday, the Bisons tra veled to Juniata where they lost their opening match to Clarion State, 11-15 and 7-15. Grieb com mented, "" First game jitters were a problem, but that's not an ex- cuse. We just didn't move on the court."" The volleyballers were also defeated by Juniata, losing 9-15 and 1-15. Grieb commented, "" We didn't read and take advantage of what their defense gave us. We also didn't use cross-court spikes."" Grieb praised Susan Atkinson '81 who ' 'played the best games of her life.""  Alison Wellington '83 also played well, the coach said. Juaniata beat Clarion, 2-0, in the third match. The spikers travel to Wash ington, D.C. Saturday where they play Catholic University for the first time ever. Grieb expects Catholic to be "" tough competition since they have an established program."" The coach is optimistic that the squad will improve, noting, "" W e've shown better team play and we're playing to the level of our competition."""
Harriers topple two more foes,"ByRO BB YSTETZ Depth was once again the key as the men's cross country team edged Rutgers, 26-33, and Manhattan, 23-38, last Saturday in New York to extend its unbeaten streak to 67 meets. After placing only two runners in the first seven positions, the Bison harriers took the next six spots to decide the meet. Bob Peterson of Manhattan placed first in 25:05 and was followed by BUI Reifsnyder '84 in 25:25. Steve Bigotto '82 was sandwiched between three Rutgers runners and placed fifth in 25:44. At this point, the outcome of the race was stUl in doubt. However, the next six racers all wore orange and blue, and the Bisons' six year streak was safe. Mark Hulme '83 and co-captain Rick Sayre '82 tied for eighth place in 26:08. They were followed by senior co-captains Mike Debraggio and Jim O'Shea who tied for tenth in 26:15. Freshman Jeff Hines took twelfth in 26:20 whUe Glenn Gibney '83 placed thirteenth in 26:22. . The Bisons showed the importance of running in a pack. According to coach Art Gulden, "" Hav ing a runner finish in first place is important, but not as important as keeping the pack together and near the front."" Gulden was also impressed with the three Bison co-cptains, stating, "" I was definitely pleas ed with the way they ran. They have improved immensely.""  All three have been hampered with nagging injuries this season. The harriers are idle untU October 4 when they host ECC rivals St. Joseph's, Lehigh and Tern pie. St. Joseph's is considered among the Bisons toughest challengers for the ECC title. Despite the closeness of the first two meets Gulden remains confident. He comments "" Many people are surprised that we haven' been dominating our opponents like we did last year. I 'm not distressed. We've had a tough early schedule and our runners have not performed anywhere near their potential. And yet, we re stUl unbeaten."" ___________ _ i : tPP Photo-- Hilary Schwab"

"Booters top Gettysburg, 3-0;",
are shut out by Lock. Haven,". .............. 7 _ _______ i nrsssure and managi By BOB DAVIS "" We're definitely the under dogs,"" was the comment of men's soccer coach Craig Reynolds prior to the Bisons' 1-0 setback against Lock Haven State College at Lewisburg Tuesday night. The loss, which dropped the booters' record to 1*1, was mark ed by a deliberate ball-control of fense on the part of the Eagles, who are ranked first in Division III. Reynolds had described the visitors as a "" big, strong, quick, offensive-minded squad,"" and added that the Bison's would re quire a "" tight man-to-man defense and a quick counter to pin Lock Haven's backs down."" The bulk of the first half was played as Reynolds had dictated, highlighted by good end-to-end action but relatively few real scoring threats. The Bison game plan was effective in thwarting the Eagle attack, but at the same time prohibited Bucknell from applying sustained pressure in close. A Lock Haven corner kick with slightly more than 16 minutes in the half resulted in the best scor ing opportunity by either team to that point. The ball was chipped high towards the Bucknell goal and descended into a pack of bodies before being cleared out to the wing in a flurry of feet. The Bison's defense began to get a little sloppy late in the half and it almost cost them. Lock Haven continued to apply"

during the Bisons' season opener against Gettysburg. The,
booters scored just 45 seconds into the match and outsho,
the Bullets 28-6,"pressure and managed a quick shot that was ticketed for the cor ner, but goaltender Pete Puccia '81 made a tough stop to keep the game scoreless. Undaunted, the Eagles kept the heat on and it finally paid off. With 4:55 left in the half, Robby Gould beat Puccia for what prov ed to be the game's only tally. The Bison's best chance of the half came on a corner kick with nine seconds remaining, but the effort fell short. The opening moments of the se cond half revealed that the Eagles were not content to sit on a one-goal lead. They completely dominated the first ten minutes of play in the period, taking the play to the Bisons, who were anything but aggressive and were consistently beaten to the ball. The momentum began to shift about midway through the half, however, as the Bison's suddenly came alive. The booters' passing started to click, resulting in some fine thrusts by forwards Duncan Lee '83 and Pat Christ '82, and by sophomore mid-fielder Mark Brotherton. the Bison's best opportunity came with just under one minute to play. Bucknell was awarded a direct kick when Bill Hibbs of Lock Haven drew a red card and was ejected for flattening a Bison player near midfield."
I,"Following a quick exchange of clearing boots, Brotherton poked the ball between two defenders for a breakaway, but the ball got too far in front of him where it was easily corralled by the Eagle goaltender. Prior to the game, Reynolds noted that the team needed "" more width on our attack; we re pinching too much in the mid dle."" He added that they needed to "" finish""  on scoring oppor tunities.

Gettysburg last Friday. The victory was the 200th in,
Bucknell varsity soccer history.,"and senior Tom parently not resolved in time for the Lock Haven match, and may have been the difference in the game. The Bison's started their season off on the right foot by shutting out Gettysburg, 3-0, in Friday night's home opener. Reynolds felt "" as good about that game as I have about any game for some time,""  adding that the team played "" pretty darned good--they controlled the game."" It took the booters just 45 seconds to get on the board when sophomore Paul Devlin took a cross inside from teammate Brotherton and drilled it behind the Gettysburg goaltender for a 1- 0 Bison edge. The second Bison strike came well into the second half, when Brian Hassinger '81 connected following a series of short passes from Devlin Rotelli. Brotherton registered the final Bison goal on a feed from Devlin several minutes later. Reynolds said of the Bison offense, "" It's nice to get three (goals) -- it'll win a lot of games for you."" Junior Paul Green racked up the shutout, playing in place of regular goalie Puccia, who was resting an injured finger. Reynolds had decided to rest Puccia, who had suffered a bone <>>hip and tendon damage to a finger. A special brace allowed him to play, but he had not had enough time to adjust his play by Friday's contest. The Bisons will seek to raise their record to 2-1 this Saturday when they travel to West Chester for a 4 p.m. game with the Rams. l U I U U C O . * >> >> << >> -------- -----"
Water polo shooting for return to NCAA tourney,"f f l ' . . 4a a snrinter on this weekend when they travel to tent to make predictions. If the By DAVE KIRKPATRICK Coach Dick Russell calls them "" The most talented team ever to play at B ucknell."" Team members' tee-shirts proclaim, "" Awesometicity."" They're all referring to the 1980 version of the men's water polo team. The squad is fresh from a 28-2*1 r e c o r d  last sp rin g that culminated in a fifth place finish at the NCAA Championship Tour nament in Long Beach, Califor nia. The Bisons' fifth place finish is the highest any team from the East has ever placed in the history of the tournament. The University of California at Santa Barbara won the title with UCLA finishing second. Bucknell also captured the Eastern Championships for an unprecedented third year in a row. -:t ,, Led by captain Scott Schulte '81, the Bisons will attempt to top last season's amazing finish. Russell calls Schulte, "" One of the top water polo players ever pro duced in the East."" Last season, Schulte scored 121 goals and was selected as a second team All- America, the only player from"
the,"East to be so honored. After a summer of intense training with top players on the west coast, Schulte, called "" The Bomber""  by his teammates, will be set to take on superstar status. Tom Butter '82 plays "" the hole,"" a passing position, and "" is the most improved player on the team,""  according to Russell. Last season, Butler contributed 34 goals and 24 assists.

Mark Gensheimer '81 handles the inside water with skill. He us ed his power to score 74 goals and 51 assists last year. Two years ago he left the broadcast booth to join the Bisons in the pool and eventually made the game saving interception which pro pelled Bucknell into their first NCAA tournament. Senior Peter Weiman is the "" heart of the squad,""  commented Russell. Weiman possesses one of the most accurate and powerful arms in the East, according to the coach. Tony Paxton '81 is the return ing goaltender, whom Russell Anils "" the very best in the East."" Last season, Paxton stopped almost 60 percent of the shots fired his way."

shocks with,
'mercy killing',"ByS.A. HABETZ and MATT KARANIAN The speaker of the American Medical Association told a University Center Forum Au dience Thursday night that he prescribed a "" minimum"" of medical treatment for his own mother and allowed her to die rather than take drastic measures to save her life. In the opening speech of "" The New Morality of Life and Death"" -- the fall colloquy here -- Dr. William Rial said he gave his mother one-sixth the standard dosage of penicillin for people with pneumonia and that she died soon afterward. He said he made a moral deci sion to allow her to die in peace rather than try "" to fight death with science."" He said his parent had lost control of her bodily functions and was "" going senile."" Rial said he delayed prescrib ing any medication until pressure from staff members at his hospital convinced him to give her some penicillin. She died soon after she was given the minimal dosage, he said. The doctor explained his stand on euthanasia during a lecture entitled the "" AMA's Stand on Medical Ethics."" Rial said he also broke an un written law of medical ethics when he testified against another doctor who he knew was prescrib ing quaaludes and speed "" without discretion."" ______ ___ _ Photo-- Megan Young Fall Colloquy 1980, ""The New Morality of Life and Death,"" began Thursday night with several film presentations and lectures. William Rial speaks Thursday on the American Medical Association's stance on medical ethics. In saying he was "" obligated"" to testify, Rial added he believed "" a sin of omission in testifying against a colleague is as serious as a sin of commission."" He also said he refuses to issue false letters of illness to workers because they then would have no way of knowing "" I won't lie when it's in (their) best interest. "" Physicians must tread the thin wire of professional action and social reality,""  he said. "" They must be continually aware of their professional and in dividual responsibilities while allowing the patient freedom of choice.""

ABS president,
outlines goals,
Asks for student activism,"By GREG HAHN In the first meeting of the Association of Bucknell Students this semester, ABS President John Dzurinko '81 outlined four items of con cern for his administration and called for student activism to help at tain specific goals. A major topic of discussion was the newly-formed Committee on Social Alternatives. Chaired by Assistant Dean of Student Affairs Joseph Mammola, the group will investigate the origins and possible effects of the stricter enforcement of the University alcohol policy. The committee also plans to explore the possibility of using the University Center's vacant third floor as an area for student groups to socialize in an alcohol-free environment. Dzurinko also expressed the need for a committee of students, ad ministrators and members of the community to examine the Moore Avenue and Route 15 intersection. A proposal to make the crossing safer is needed, Dzurinko said. He added that engineering studies should be made, such as one for an underground tunnel, which has already been given a one-half million dollar price tag. Dzurinko also called for a socially oriented curriculum, saying that a student "" shouldn't be penalized through anxiety and frustration for late curricular work when doing a student service."" He said that we need a new concept of education, where the curriculum serves a greater role in the community."" He also encouraged members of the ABS Congress to become in volved in the Student Roundtable, composed of leaders from the various campus organizations. Dzurinko also said that the students--and the ABS in particular- should have more involvement in the selection of commencement speakers. Presently, President Dennis O'Brien chooses a faculty member and a parent to address the students, and Dzurinko said he is meeting with O'Brien Tuesday to determine whether more student in put can be incorporated. Later in the meeting, Richard Pisano '82 of the Finance Committee informed the Congress of possible tuition increases next year. For juniors, the figure could be $900 while other undergraduates might have a $750 additional expense."

Marts garbage burning halts,
as recycling policy reverses,"By KEN WOLCKENHAUER Incineration of garbage was recently stopped in Marts Hall as a result of a reversal in the University's policy pn recycling. The dust and pollution which usually eminates from the smokestack there has ceased In response tc complaints from students, the Recycling Club, and adverse publicity in the Bucknellian last year, the physical plant analyzed its waste disposal policies from both a cost and environmental point of view, according to Superintendant of Buildings Robert Millward. Garbage collected on campus in the past was burned either at the physical plant or in Marts Hall Because office materials from Marts and the library often contained pollutants such as plastics which adversely affect air quality, these materials have been rerouted from the in cinerators to an Allenwood land fill. The significance of this development, according to the Recycling Club, is that this is the first step toward a new Universi ty waste policy which emphasizes conservation and environmental protection as well as eventual cost efficiency. "" We're really very pleased with this change,"" noted Millward. "" We realized that we had been paying someone to sit by the burners while the garbage burned, and all we have to do now is pack it up and take it to the landfill."" Millward said he was also pleased that the physical plant is ilo longer disturbing the com munity with black smoke and its accompanying odors. Incineration was considered the cheapest, easiest and most environmentally safe way to dispose of the waste until recent ly, according to Millward. "" After all, the landfill has its limits,""  he said. The change came because the quantity being burned was recognized as a "" very significant amount,""  which could cause a"

New report on bookstore filed,"By DAVID HAWKINGS An independent report by University Bookstore liaison Jackson Hill released this week appears to have placated both the store's management and the faculty committee that has been working to make improvements at the store. The report both agrees with the Bookstore Advisory Committee that an increase is needed in the stock of academic "" trade books"" and supports the contentions of Manager Warren Elze that the store's "" emporium"" must re main if the store is to survive financially. Hill -- an associate professor of music appointed in June to under take his own study of the opera tions at the University -- said in his 17-page report that "" The management's perspective is ac tually far closer to the faculty's than most faculty would think."" Hill's suggestions differ most from the report of the six faculty advisory committee in asking that only $10,000 be allocated for the formation of an enlarged stock of "" quality"" trade books and classical records. The report of the committee made public Sept. 8 specified $30,000 as the amount that should be spent. "" That's asking a bit much,"" Hill said in an interview Wednes day, adding that the larger amount was equal to two begin ning faculty salaries here. Hill said his job was to find an "" appropriate balance between a realistic and appropriate way"" to run the bookstore. "" An assumption is that we are doing this primarily for the students,""  he said. "" A store designed primarily for the facul ty would be a bigger mistake than leaving things the way they are now."" In calling for an enlarged book department -- with a minimum of space equal to what now exists for non-textbook items at the store -- Hill said other books and "" fast-sell"" items should not be discontinued as a result. "" If Harold Robbins belongs in the bookstore, then certainly Shakespeare does too,""  he said. In one of the most strongly- worded paragraphs of the memorandum, Hill said "" having Monarch Notes on campus is reprehensible"" and "" should be eliminated"" from the store. He likened them in the inter view to the pornographic magazine Hustler, saying the refusal to sell either would be a statement "" of taste, not cen sorship."" But the growing controversy concerning the sale of study aids at the store appeared to have no easy resolution, with neither Elze or the faculty members changing their opinion and with no one ap parently knowing who would make the final decision on the matter. Both Elze and Bookstore Ad visory Committee Chairman Bar bara Shailor praised the report, which Shailor called "" a fine com plement to the work we did."" Elze said the Hill publication was "" an objective piece of work,"" but he reiterated his com ment that the committee's report was "" not constructive or objec tive."" Shailor said Elze's remarks"
JACKSON HILL,"about parts of the group's report being "" trash and nonsense"" -- printed in last week's Buck- nellian -- were "" counterproduc tive,""  "" not tactful"" and would "" not contribute to better com munication between the faculty and the store."""

dining service improvements,"By SUSAN MacDONALD In an effort to solicit responses from students, the University Dining Service, under the direction of Henry (Hank) Ross, recently placed comment cards on cafeteria tables. Ross said he likes to hear student suggestions. "" I wish all the students would feel that way; we are very receptive. Unfortunately,""  he said, "" we didn't get too many good jokes."" However, there were many requests for items such as low-calorie salad dressings and fresh fruits. Some of the comments did not concern the food, but rather the lunch line crowds. One person sug gested only students with fast passes be allowed in the cafeteria from 11:50 a.m. to 12:15 p.m. Another student said the cafeteria should be opened at 11:15 a.m. as a way to eliminate the crowds. Ross said he will post some of the many suggestions he received on the bulletin board out side the cafeteria doors with his replies. The ABS Dining Room Committee also offers a lot of constructive criticism, Ross said. "" It's nice to have students who are interested and who take time to try new ideas,"" he added. The committee meets with Ross for about one hour every other week ""to just sit down, talk, and decide which things should be changed. I really wish I had more time to devote to that,""  Ross said. Members of the committee suggested placing bread on the side tables as a way to avoid the bot tleneck of persons in line. Students also help plan the special meals, and the comment card is student- designed. About 275 students work parttime in the cafeteria, normally nine and a half hours a week. This year they are working for pay, but in the past the work was used in exchange for board. The switch was made for several reasons, according to Ross. As a paid position, the job can be included as part of the Federal Work Study program. The change also brings the Dining Service into line with other paying jobs on campus. Student employees are re quired to take a full meal plan in the cafeteria, however. The dining service issued about 2200 meal tickets this semester. The most popular plan is the 7-2 op tion, with which students eat two meals seven days a week. Ross said that there has been little change from last year in either lunch or dinner crowds. They can almost always be predicted to within 75 students, he said. "" Breakfast, however, is up 200 to 250 more people than last year,"" Ross said. Attendance at late meals, which are open to athletic teams, is up from 300 students last year to 450 now. Greater participa tion in women's athletics seems to have contributed the most to this increase, Ross said. The cafeteria does its best to provide a variety of choices for the students, Ross said. Fish is available every night, and the vegetarian meal plan is an op tion. Nearly 300 students have vegetarian meal tickets. Ross is hoping to have the vegetarian choice placed on the computer for the next school year so they would be printed on in the same manner as fast passes are. Eventually he wants to offer the vegetarian meal as a regular option on the menu."
"ABS grants $9,700",
to student organizations,"The ABS Appropriations Committee announced Wednesday they have awarded $9,700 in late and appealed appropriation requests to seven student organizations. The committee awarded 88 percent of the money requested by the groups after a series of hearings at the University Center Sunday night. ABS Treasurer Pam Ecock '82 announced the figures after receiv ing notification from University Controller Ellis Harley Wednesday morning that the funds, derived from student activities fees included in tuition, were well in excess of the amount appropriated. Of the six student organizations requesting 1980-81 funds for the first time, the Politics Club was the only group to be given all it re quested--an $800 stipend which will be used to help pay publishing costs of the Medium of Exchange, a joint publication of the Politics and Economics Clubs. The Bucknellian--the only student organization to appeal its i spring appropriation--received an additional $3975, which Editor Ken Quaas '82 said would be used primarily to offset an increase in printing costs. The Bucknell Dance Company was the hardest hit by the commit tee's actions, receiving only $1115--or 63 percent--of the $1765 they had requested to mount performances for this year. The Bowling and Rifle Clubs received $540 and $360 for their respective events, over 90 percent of what they had requested. The Ice Hockey Club and Frisbee Club each received about 75 per cent of their total requests. All other student organizations had been given appropriations from the committee.after a weekend of hearings in May. Photo-- John Stoudinger"

Millward said the paper bins on campus are often overflowing, and a professor complained that it was inconvenient and a bother to store large quantities of paper or bring them to the physical plant. A lthough re cy clin g has previously been a voluntary ef fort, the University now seems to be adopting it as a policy. Vice President for Administration and Finance John Zeller said that despite his earlier skepticism about costs, he will allow the physical plant and the recycling club to try this limited experi ment. ABS president John Dzurinko '81 said, "" The University has recognized the serious aesthetic problem and the disadvantage to the entire community of not recycling."" He said the key to the success of the program "" will be the inclu sion of custodians in the collec ting of materials and, in the long run, the physical plant providing for recycling."" The Recycling Club has de tailed plans by which the Univer sity will adopt a full and efficient waste disposal plan which will focus on recycling. First, the University's paper baler will b e ' renovated with Recycling Club funds at a cost of about $300. The machine will be used in conjunction with the League of Women Voters, who are running a community recycl ing program led by Nora Elze, assistant professor of physical education here. Second, the physical plant has offered the two groups the use of dumpsters not in service to aid in the collection of recyclable papers. The Recycling Club has also gained access to the Busser Building on Market Street for use as a headquarters. Elze worked in collaboration with the club to obtain the borough-owned building which is now partly used for glass recycling. The goal of the club is to use these developments to create a system that will eventually lead to the recycling of all paper. The baler will save great amounts of man power and make more money. The club currently bales paper into small bundles by hand and is paid $20 per ton for it by the Staiman Bros, baling company of Williamsport. It is then trucked to a York recycling plant. With the baler the club will be able to get over $50 per ton. Eventually they will pursue their own contract with a recycl ing facility and receive direct payments for the baled paper. Bob Doms '81, president of the Recycling Club, said arrange ments will soon be made for col lection of paper from the two- handed collectors the physical plant will put in the administra tion buildings. He said the club has 120 members now and should be able to easily handle the burden during the school year."

in Greek Weekend carnival,
By,
MARY LISA MURGIANO,"Greek Weekend was a "" huge success""  according to Donn Zacune '81, public relations officer for the Interfraternity Council. The sponsors of the events, the IFC and the Panhellenic Council, are donating all proceeds from the Weekend to charity. In excess of $2,000 was rais ed for the American Cancer Society in last Thurs day's Swim-For-Cancer event. Proceeds from other Greek Weekend activities have not been tallied yet. The profits, however, will be donated to the Listening Post, a counseling ser vice in the Lewisburg public school system. The Listening Post employs several University students. According to Zacune, the weekend's only problem arose when a band, Alecstar, slated to perform at the all campus party Saturday night, cancelled at 6 p m that evening. The IFC managed to engage a band from Hazleton, White Water, on short notice. There were no problems concerning the Universi ty's new policy on alcoholic beverage consumption on school property. Zacune said all alcohol was served on private fraternity property. More than 37 groups and organizations par ticipated in Greek Weekend Games Saturday. Of them, Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority was the overall winner. Kappa Delta Rho fraternity won the volleyball competition, Phi Kappa Psi fraternity won the frisbee throw and the 3rd Trax and 4th Har ris hall groups won the pyramid-building contest. Other games which were not scored included tug-of- war and earth ball. Pi Beta Phi sorority won first prize in the banner contest. The combined efforts of Phi Gamma Delta fraternity and Beta Gamma sorority won second place in that event. As for next year's Greek Weekend, Zacune said, "" I'll just make proposals and suggestions on how to better organize it.""  One suggestion that Zacune will make is to have the games earlier in the semester, before the study load increases."

presidential campaigns,
#,
g--,"By MARY LISA MURGIANO Student groups have been working on the presidential cam paign here on campus and local ly. Groups campaigning for John Anderson, Ronald Reagan and Ed Clark, the Libertarian can didate have formed. Reagan's campaign on campus is the most visible and organized"
CAMPAIGN,
UPDATE,"to date and boasts a volunteer force of 60-65 students. According to Tom DeCain '83, director of the Bucknell College Republicans, the group's main job consists of "" finding out who's voting for who and persuading students to vote for Reagan."" DeCain, who worked at Republican Headquarters as an intern last January and attended the National Convention in Detroit said, "" We have an en thusiastic bunch willing to put in a lot of time.""  DeCain hopes that "" within the next few weeks""  his group will be "" out and working"" to get Reagan elected. Anderson, the Independent candidate for president, also has a large following at Bucknell, but his campaign here lacks leader ship and unity. Senior Bob Doms, who previously coordinated the drive, has stepped down from his posi tion and is looking for a succesor. Doms noted that there are many individuals currently working for Anderson but there is no con certed group effort. "" It's difficult to find leaders around here,"" Doms said. He pointed out that much work was done for the Anderson cam paign last semester, however. Students circulated petitions to get Anderson on the presidential ballot and many contacted area residents who were potential Anderson supporters. Ed Mastascusa '84, is begin ning a drive for Libertarian can didate Ed Clark. Mastascusa, who is the co-chairman of the Northern Half of the 17th Con gressional District Libertarian. Party, does not have widespread support here, but had several volunteers who worked over the summer. Mastascusa's goal is to get enough volunteers involved with Clark's campaign. "" It would be ideal to pass out between five and 10 thousand pieces of literature in the area,""  he noted. There are no organized cam paign efforts for President Jim my Carter here at this tune.

Turks protest to,
stop British film,"The Turkish embassy in Great Britain is concerned about a new film soon to be released by film makers there. According to English sources, the Turkish embassy has pro tested to the British Film Board the proposed release of a film called Gallipoli. The film portrays events of the unsuccessful British attempt to invade the Turk mainland during World War I. According to Turk officials, the film shows that Turks behaved barbarically in the course of the battle. The film also refers to massacres the Turks have committed over the ages. "" For this reason, Ankara is in tervening to stop the showing of the film,""  said an official of the Turkish embassy in London."

Iraqi demonstrators,

The Iraqi men were returning home from an anti-Iranian demonstration at the Iranian em bassy in New York. They were en route to Chicago and had stopped in Danville for gasoline. While at the gasoline station, one of the men is alleged to have removed money from a cash drawer while a station attendant filled the gas tank of his car. Police apprehended the men about two miles from the scene, on Interstate 80. In addition to the charges of theft and criminal con spiracy, one man was charged with concealing offensive weapons. He was carrying a switchblade and an 18-inch machete. He is being held in lieu of $15,000 bail."

McNerney will probably re main in intensive care for another week, according to hospital officials. The full extent of her injuries is not yet known. John Zeller, vice president for administration and finance, said there is a need for additional lighting at the intersection of Route 15 and Moore Avenue. "" I have written a letter to the Penn sylvan ia D epartm ent of Transportation and asked whether they would permit the University to install more lighting at the intersection,"" Zeller said. He also said the University "" would like to have a flashing light in the south-bound lane on 15 in addition to the existing one in the north-bound lane.""

Zeller refused to comment fur ther on his reasons for discharg ing the two campus patrolmen. University advertisement for patrolmen calls for applicants with "" a minimum of high school or equivalent""  schooling. It also states "" associate degree, armed services, security and Safety training""  is preferred. Physical Plant director John Bell said he hopes to have a Director of Security hired before he fills the two vacant patrolman positions. The new director would replace the position left vacant by Chief of Security Norman Fine, who said he is retiring this year. Although applicants are being screened now for both the direc tor and patrolman positions, Bell would not comment as to when he expects actual hiring to be com pleted."

Interaction and Diversity sponsors,
discussion on alcohol policy changes,"By TRICIA KENNEDY Potential ramifications of the University drinking policy were among the major topics of discus sion at a meeting Sunday of students and administration leaders. The meeting was sponsored by Interaction and Diversity, and was a forum for discussion bet ween Associate Director of Residential Life Gerald Commer- ford, Dean of Student Affairs John Dunlop, ABS president John 'Dzurinko '81, members of the committee and any student who wished to attend. Only three students attended the meeting. Dunlop said the much publiciz ed drinking policy is not entirely new, but rather that there is now a "" new mode of enforcing""  the policy. The need to "" avoid liability for University em ployees,"" par ticularly residential directors and resident assistants, is a reason for stricter enforcement of the alcohol policy, Dunlop said. Dunlop said there has been evidence of a "" marked increase"" of consumption of alcohol on campus in recent years. The ad m inistration sees drinking becoming a "" disproportionate part of college life,"" he said. Part of the administration's in tention in strictly enforcing the alcohol policy is to encourage students to develop a sense of responsibility about their drink ing, according to Commerford. "" Bucknell has realized that drinking is a way of life in our society,""  Commerford said, "" but what are you going to do to keep from drinking yourself into trou ble?"" Dunlop and Commerford both agreed there is a need for social events on campus other than those that feature alcohol. Sug gestions made by students at the meeting included more study breaks and ice cream parties, dances and roller skating. There was also a motion made to open the third floor of the University Center as a perma nent home for on-campus social li--- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- activities. Such a center would help students develop "" a real sense of community"" that is lacking here, Dzurinko said. A committee is now being formed to create social alter natives here. Dzurinko and others emphasized the need for students to have input into the decisions of the committee. Stu dent groups should come up with ideas for weekend and non w eekend socia l functions, Dzurinko said."

R,"did a lot of passport pictures there,""  she said. At the same time, Cross was working as a free-lance photographer for the Union Coun ty Journal. Her breakthrough in to fu ll-tim e p rofession a l photography occurred after a football game against Boston University last year. There, Cross photographed what she still calls her "" favorite shot,""  featuring player Bruce Keltie '81 in mid-air. This picture so impressed former Sports In formation D irector Dennis O'Shea that shortly afterward, Cross was promoted to the posi tion of official University photographer. Since that time, little has escaped Cross' photographic eye. An avid bicyclist, she has photographed bicycle raoes, horse races and even turtle races. A favorite subject is also flowers, as she is motivated by her biological studies -- "" that was helpful in learning composi tion;""  -- she has also photo graphed hang-gliders and sky- divers from the air. Cross calls frisbee "" her favorite sport""  to photograph, with football second. Her photographic equipment is basic -- a 35-millimeter Vivitar, wide-angle lens and a 200 or 300 millimeter lens for sports events. "" I rarely use special effects,"" Cross said. "" My photos aren't pretty or artful -- they're useful. Still, it's a lot more fun to take pictures than to develop them in the darkroom."" Part of the reason for this is the "" rather severe problem"" in volved in sharing darkroom facilities with University faculty and student clubs. "" It's a big fight for space -- everyone wants more room.""  Cross is optimistic about a proposed Media/Com- munications center at the Univer sity, but adds "" it's still probably five years or so away."""
A,"painter as well as a photographer, Cross explained the differing philosophies bet ween the two art forms: "" In photogrphy, everything is there already. The situation presents itself and you have a given time to capture it. It's very intense -- when it's over, it's gone. The hardest thing to do is concen trate, you have to be just a pair of eyes."" One thing students can be sure of is that little will escape Cross' camera this semester. "" I think the best thing to take pictures of is people,"" said Cross. "" You can make friends with anyone if you take their picture."" So don't be surprised if you see a camera aimed at you some Satur day afternoon in Memorial Stadium -- it's just Kate Cross, University photographer, at work."

Better than book money,
The University Bookstore has become the target of some heavy,
faculty fire. They contend that our bookstore isn't; it is instead a,
novelty drugstore -- an emporium -- the Rea and Derick of the,
University Center.,
"To investigate these persistent accusations, President O'Brien ap",
pointed Jackson Hill as a faculty liaison as well as a six-member,
faculty committee. Hill's conclusions are interesting and construc,
tive while at the same time supportive of the committee's critical,
contention that the store is not the haven for knowledge they say it,
should be.,
"While the bookstore is no library of classic literature, it is much",
"more than a showcase of shlock. It provides the everyday needs,",
some of the extras and even some of the unwanted.,
The Hill memorandum recommends that the bookstore increase,
classical book and record offerings and deemphasize the high-,
turnover novelty items by taking the former and placing them in the,
eye-catching spots where the latter have been. This is fine. Hill also,
"recommends that $10,000 be invested in improving the ""quality",
"book"" selection -- a more realistic sum than the $30,000 asked for by",
the advisory committee.,
"While this suggestion is well-intentioned, we think it is misdirected",
"in priority. After a week of contemplating calculus, engineering or",
"Tolstoy, most students will not read a bookstore-bought copy of",
Paradise Lost on the weekend. Forget it.,
BUClCKlELL,
BucfcNELJL/s,
*7^<<,
"Why not put the $10,000 into the library? If a student is interested",
"in doing some ""good"" reading, surely he should be able to find what",
he wants there. If he wants his own copy -- and is willing to pay the,
premium price of purchase -- he can order anything through the,
bookstore.,
The concern for image and self-betterment should be directed not,
"at the bookstore, but at Bucknell's most pressing need: the",
establishment of social alternatives on campus not dependent on,
"alcohol -  like Christy's Gate. The $10,000 could also do much in this",
direction. The quality of student life is more severely affected these,
days by the confining social life than by an abundance of Snoopy,
mugs at the bookstore.,
Abroad support,
"From Harrisburg to Washington to Aix-en-Provence to Nepal, op",
portunities for off-campus academic credit abound. The University,
itself organizes a program with its faculty almost every semester; it,
also maintains ties both official and unofficial with a variety of other,
programs both foreign and domestic.,
"Unfortunately, the University has been less than supportive of ef",
"forts by both students and faculty to travel on Bucknell's time, credit",
and funds. Questions and objections by the administration about the,
"status of grades, credits, salaries, tuition and financial aid have",
hampered a potential flourishing of a trend toward study elsewhere.,
"The establishment of a student, faculty and administration com",
mittee on off-campus study last year is a positive step; we hope they,
succeed in solving the logistical problems put to it by the rest of the,
"University, and that the result will be a student body with a perspec",
tive enlightened by an international view.,

A reversal in the physical plant's policies on waste disposal and,
"recycling deserves notice, for changes have been long in coming. No",
longer will strolling students be subjected to the acrid smoke from,
"Marts Hall waste incineration operations. Now, the harmful",
pollutants will be trucked to a safe landfill--at a savings.,
The administration has also seen the merits of encouraging,
^recycling when cost efficient. In keeping with the ever-increasing,
"problem of dwindling resources, recycling is the first step in plan",
ning for the realities of the future. All that remain^ for the Recycling,
Club and other concerned groups to accomplish is to instill the same,
"spirit in the average student, who could care less about throwing",
away scrap paper.,
More motivation for recycling-- such as a special fund for recyc,
ling savings to be applied towards student activities and more,
"recycling bins, etc.--are clearly necessary.",

Bookstore should continue catering to the students,"By KRIS FORSYTHE Warren Elze, manager of the University Bookstore, is entirely correct when he states that the faculty "" must realize this is a bookstore and not a library,""  as he did in last week's Bucknellian. The bookstore does, of course, sell books, hence the name. However, once course books are purchased, one cannot expect students to be attracted to the"

After being inundated by engineering, calculus, political theory and the myriad other "" quality""  subjects of study, the "" serious""  student needs a bit of entertainment. The bookstore of fers a convenient and basically well-stocked display of such material. When the committee refers to "" too much plain junk,""  I do hope it is not including science fiction and bestsellers as targets of its complaint. Many serious social commentaries such as Brave New World and 1984, have been written by masters of science fic tion, and both were "" best sellers.""  It is not fair to condemn a whole literary category -- "" junk"" is found in all disciplines, even in highly intellectual ones. The bookstore does not just contain only course books and best-sellers. There are many books in many different fields: biographies of famous people, works by Freud and Fromm, and writings on travel, cooking, mechanics...the list, like the selection, is rather extensive.

Corporate women face obstacles in climb to top,"ningham as his executive assistant upon her graduation from Harvard 15 months ago. After less than a year with Bendix, she was promoted to vice presi dent for corporate and public affairs, and last week she received the controversial promotion to vice president of strategic planning. Cunningham graduated from Wellesley College in 1973 and was an assistant treasurer at Chase Manhattan Bank before attending graduate school. The career path seems to be that of a young corporate superstar--if the employee was a man. The media coverage and intra-company in- nuedo demonstrates that, despite claims of equality, young women still face difficult obstacles in their climb up the corporate ladder. Bucknell women should question interviewers about how their com pany really treats women. On the average, how long do women stay with the company? What is the company's record of promoting women? What type of prejudices are women subject to in their com"
pany?,"The answers to such questions should give the student an idea of what to expect if they go to work for the firm. The interviewer may give sincere answers, but they may answer with stereotyped, water- cooler-type-joke lines. On Monday, Cunningham asked for a leave of absence from her new job, because she felt that her managerial effectiveness had been diminished because of the publicity resulting from her promotion. However, on Wednesday a committee of the Bendix board of directors rejected her proposal and gave her their unanimous vote of con fidence. Hopefully a positive precedent has been set. Employees should be judged solely on their job performance, not their sex or age."

Finally, the committee might take into consideration that even if the bookstore did stock these "" quality""  books, the students would, in all likelihood, not buy them. Face it, when one has had a rough week, one would much rather read a light, "" easy- reader""  novel than The Grapes of Wrath. If a "" quality""  book is desired, one is more likely to bor row it from the library than buy it from the bookstore. If a specific book is desired, there is always the "" special order."" Instead of a $30,000 financial commitment to the bookstore, why not give the money to the library? In this way, a quality book would be available to the en tire campus rather than only to the one who buys the book, and the bookstore could sell the less- intellectual material so that students would have a choice. By not offering a variety of material, it is quite possible that students will reject the only material offered as a matter of principle, and thus defeat the en tire purpose of an "" intellectual"" atmosphere.

"Giffard of Deauville, France, is assisting French professors during",
his year on campus. Giffard will be called upon to give a native's point of,
I view on the French language and culture.,
Campus life is agreeable,
I to student from France,
By,
SHARI HOLMES,"An exchange system between Bucknell and the University of Caen has brought to I campus Jean-Claude Giffard, a native of France who makes his home in Deauville on the [English Channel. At 24 years old, Giffard is in his fifth year of study in France and has two more years !remaining before he receives his Ph.D. While at Bucknell, he is not taking any courses [for credit, though he attends some "" just to have a look."" His main responsibility is to assist the French professors with their classes. Working a [total of 14 hours a week, he helps with French 103, French 104, French 270 and leads a |class in conversational French. In these classes, Giffard presents the Frenchmen's point [of view and opinions, which are useful in trying to understand French culture. | Having travelled extensively throughout Europe since the age of six, Giffard is no |novice at adjusting to different cultures. "" I lived in London for two years and know the |British style of life. I'm used to changing from one culture to another."" Although he says [that Europe provides more different cultures and lifestyles in a smaller area than the lU.S. and his original plan was to study in Dublin, Giffard is "" very glad it worked out this |way."" I Despite his former traveling experiences, Giffard describes America as a new |world."" When asked if adjusting to the American lifestyle is difficult, he said, "" I avoid #the thought that my own culture is the best."" | Giffard does, however, find many differences between American and French univer sities. The most noticeable was the age difference between him and the students here. In |France, the "" universities"" are strictly for graduate work. Here, he was surprised to find [undergraduates of a younger age than him. Another surprise was the rigor of academics here. "" To me, you're all working like |mad,"" he said. Giffard says that courses here are far more structured than those in [France, and the emphasis professors place on attendance is also different. In France, a [student is not obliged to attend classes; the main emphasis is instead placed on passing] [the exam at the end of the course. One less than pleasant aspect of his stay on campus seems to be the cafeteria food, [when asked to compare it with his own in France, he paused a moment and said delicate-] [ly, "" It's edible."" | Giffard's plans include taking an active part in the French Club, and planning French | meals for club members and guests. He is also continuing his hobby of photography by I | working for the L'Agenda. Although he has not traveled around the U.S. as yet, Giffard is planning to visit Mon treal for Thanksgiving, and during the semester hopes to make trips to New York City. Also planned for January is a trip through the southwest, including California. "" It is best to see as much of a new country as one can,"" he said."

Semester abroad gives a new,"By MEG KREMZNER The students enrolled in the London semester : were sitting in a bar on the upper level of the Pan American terminal at Kennedy International Air- j port in New York City. There were about 20 of us at that point. Surveying the group, it occurred to me that I only knew two of them. It was therefore odd to consider that in the next four months I would get to know the people accompanying me to England bet ter than anyone else I knew at Bucknell. Initially, the notion of living in a small London hotel with 30 of my fellow students had not been ap pealing. When I thought of living in LewiSburg and in a dorm yet another year, however, I knew it was time for a change. My judgment proved correct; it was impossible not to form a deep attachment to the people I shared my semester abroad with. The closeness that developed between the inhabitants of the Sutherland Hotel proved to be the best aspect of what turned out to be the most liberal educational experience of my life. Last semester's program was one of a number of fered for studying abroad. Dennis Baumwoll and Karl Patten, associate professors of English, led the group. Immediately after arriving, we began to settle in to a routine. Classes were held on Tuesday, Wednes day and Thursday, which left the remaining four days free for studying. Of course, there were many times when we'd put aside the books and venture about the streets of the city. It was impossible to become bored "" The education we got was not so much from the books and classes, but more from just being there. Taking everything London had to offer, and everything we had to offer each other, we learned so much more,"" is what junior Sylvia Sukop says of her semester abroad. With an average of 300 different films and 100 dif ferent plays available each week, the ennui that sometimes overtakes students in Lewisburg was non-existent. Months could be spent just wandering through the open markets and historical sites wat ching and conversing with different people of Lon don, eccentrics included. "" A streetcleaner told us that Princess Anne was dancing naked at the Windsor Castle pub. He was ly ing. It was the Warrington pub,"" reminisces Craig Ullman '81, in a quote that just might capture the semester's ambience. psa*' s ssii: * -"

WALTER ODRONIC,"By ANNE PAVUK For those students who are thinking of spending a semester abroad or in Washington, now is the time to act. Walter Odronic, director of overseas studies, has expressed concern that students don't "" plan enough in advance to spend a semester abroad."" The fall deadline is Oct. 15 and each student must have the ap proval of the university in the country in which he is interested in addition to approval here. The criteria by which students are chosen for the program are two-fold. First, a student should arrange for an interview as soon as possible with Odronic. He then will be given three forms to fill out, including personal data, a statement of purpose and an ap- proval or recommendation form to be completed by a professor. A committee comprised of Odronic, John Pyper, associate dean of the College of Arts and Sciences; Robert Chambers, dean of the College of Arts and S c ie n c e s; John Murphy, associate professor of English; Allan Grundstrom, chairman of linguistics and French; Susan Fischer, assistant professor of Spanish, and student represen tative David Hawkings '82 evaluate the academic merit of each program proposal, and decide if other universities' abroad programs, as well as some non-traditional student created programs, can be given credit at Bucknell. The commit tee is also responsible for the ac- spon- creditation of University sored programs. The study abroad program in cludes most countries around the world. Odronic emphasizes that this is not an exchange program, as all of the universities abroad are American. Nevertheless, students whose classes will be taught in English must still have at least an elementary knowledge of the language of the country they are visiting. Odronic strong ly advises two semesters of a foreign language at Bucknell in preparation for going abroad. The program is open to first semester seniors and juniors who may go overseas for one semester or the entire year, and to second semester sophomores if they are language majors. #"

V,"t ""m it - _ 11 n Pnir omhll By ALLISON ABOUCHAR For the past five years, students here have been visiting France for three weeks in January. This program was first begun as a preparation for students majoring in French to live abroad second semester, but has since broadened to include others as well. program was primarily designed for French majors who will study in France second semester, but any other students are Tncom-aged and welcome to come,"" Professor Allen Grundstrom of Frendi and linguistics said.

Avignon and Aix-en- Provence, the sites of the two Bucknell sponsored programs, were on the itinerary as weU. Recently, another University program for second semester has been established in Paris.

Grundstrom said the program allows students a fair amount of free time, with scheduling of one major activity per day. "" We ve had a fairly successful balance between organized and free time, he explained. During free time, students attended movies, theater and discotheques. These activities, both faculty and students agree, provided valuable glimpses of French culture as well as the op portunity to practice the language. . Orth said he found it interesting that while visiting tourist attrac tions so many natives responded in English when he spoke to them. He said this was because "" they like the opportunity to practice English, not that they are snobby*"" Other students have similarly favorable reports of the people of France. "" They're just like anyone else. Once you get to know them, they're very nice,""  said Meredy Weir, '82, who spent last semester on the Avignon program. During this program, classes are con ducted entirely in French. _ _ ,, ____ . "" The all-French classes were excellent. They help give a French perspective and provide students good accents to follow,""  said Weir. The other programs, Aix-en-Provence and Pans, have classes conducted in English as well.

Art professor Lasansky,
opens at Center Gallery,"By WILLIAM WALZ Eighteen works of art in cast bronze, steel and terra cotta will be featured in an exhibit in the Center Gallery. They are re- cent works of William LMansky, sculptor wlUl dejected, even and professor of art at the University. and composition. Many plaques in this show bear witness to these more graphic interests. Much of Lasansky's artwork represents Lasansky also plans to display the photographs of nine clay models for future translation into bronze or stone sculpture. In 20 years, the artist's sculpture has progressed from realistic in-the-round por traits and figures, such as his imposing ""El Cid"" on horseback, to more abstract and figurative sculpture, characterized by seemingly pliable sheets and shields about a realistic face. His more recent cast bronze sculpture is figurative in imagery, much of it bearing the influence of his previous forged and welded work: the bronze appears layered or bent like sheets of steel. The technique of relief, which he employs, offers a visual surprise and an in sight into form as well as a thematic state ment. From the front the sculpture ap pears swelling with form to create an illu sion of mass, while a view from behind often exposes the hollowness of the piece. distorted faces. They are beleaguered by their very garments; thick rainwear, op pressive suits of armor with chingards and visors applied in patches nearly smother them. Taking refuge in these metal sheets, only their faces are exposed, reluctantly, it seems, since they never look out with in terest. Some have retreated further -- into sleep. It seems Lasansky has sculpted characters of a nation having lost a war. There is a prisoner of war in chains, even a young girl in a helmet, but most of his figures are exhausted refugees conveying a strong sense of isolation and loneliness. Less obvious is an underlying sense of primitive ritual in Lasansky's work. His "" Stella"" portrays a helmeted face and hand protruding upward from an altar-like box in gesture of pagan worship. Raised patterns are repeated symmetrically on the altar piece suggesting further its ritualistic undertones. "" Plague IX,"" de-"

At 10:30 p.m., the Bucknell Jazz and Rock Ensemble, who recently cut a new album, will provide music for dancing. By ROBIN MEREDITH Marguerite Miller, Lewisburg resident, joined the University faculty this fall when her classes in the Suzuki method of violin instruction were incorporated into the curriculum. The Suzuki method, subtitled "" the mother tongue method,"" is based on the theory that a child can learn to play any instrument as soon as he can unders tand his native language provided he learns ear ly enough, usually at age two or three. Having taught children in the area for the past four years, Miller proposed last spring that the program be adopted in the fall to provide a teaching situation for music education majors, who will observe how each new student starts out, using video tape sessions to record the year's progress. The first of these sessions will begin next week with Cathy Miller '82 narrating. Miller expressed the opinion that her program, consisting of 24 private students, would probably benefit from the move. "" The number of students I can teach cannot expand unless I have an assistant. I meet with each student three times a week for half an hour, two of the sessions being private and one a group class so they can learn to play musically with others."" The sessions take up most of her time, although she already has one assistant working with her this semester. The opportunity, according to Miller, could en courage more music education majors to enter the field because teaching the Suzuki method is a full time occupation. ''With the teaching situation the way it is, ma jors Tieed new and innovative ways to use their training,"" Miller said. She says she can foresee university students helping with and eventually taking over some of her classes, allowing her to oversee the project as a whole. She would like to set up a teacher training program, possibly attending a training session next summer to prepare herself. Miller also envisions a summer institute to train Suzuki teachers that would attract more people to the campus and introduce them to the music depart ment. "" The method is really popular in many places,"" she said, "" and is readily catching on in this area, looking at the increase in students over the past years that have heard strictly through word of mouth. I do no advertising."" Teaching string classes in the public schools, she spent much of the lesson time undoing mistakes the children practiced during the week. By including the family in the lessons many of those errors do not occur. The structure of the program requires that mothers attend each session with their children, so that when practicing is done at home they can repeat the instructions of the teacher. Because the children first learn by hearing the pieces played correctly on a record and not by reading music, family time must be spent listening to these recordings. The family participation provides an environ ment for the children that not only fosters musical skill but also social skill that molds the character of the youngsters. Their parents claim to have few disciplinary problems and assert that the children are better prepared to follow directions, be neat and do their schoolwork. The founder of the Suzuki method describes its purpose as "" not to turn out prodigies or virtuosi, though some do become that, but just to turn out a noble kind of people who have an appreciation of the arts through music."""

Brunch at the Trencherman,
always a valiant experience,"By DAVID HAWKINGS The tradition of going out for Sunday brunch has grown fast and strong in New York, Philadelphia, Washington D.C. and Lewisburg. While the herd of students here continues to assemble for the crowded ritual of mass-produced Eggs Benedict in Roy Grier, a small but persistent group ven tures outside the University. Most go to places like Perkin's Pancake House on Route 15, but the far better bet - and better buy - seems consistently to be The Valiant Trencherman on North 2nd Street. The point of eating out of "" the caf""  seems to be simply to get off campus for an hour or two, to rem ove oneself from the pressures of collegiate time and place and to enjoy the food while away. On Sunday, there is no public place in town more relaxed than the Trencherman. Ironically and unfortunately, this quality of at mosphere also introduces a Bohe mian quality of almost com pulsive laxity to the brunch that often obscures both the quality of the food and the very reason for getting away. During the week, the two 32- year-old owners, David Graham and Jan Muzyczka, offer a menu of fish, chicken, quiche and vegetarian dishes at both lunch and dinner that are generally well prepared and well served while offering a refreshingly uni que culinary option to this part of the world. The list of brunchtime edibles is also as non-traditional as can be imagined; it is hard to offer a brunch buffet without eggs or pancakes, but at the Trencner- man they offer neither, and neither is missed. What is missed is the sense that the owners have been offering brunch each Sun day since their restaurant opened in September 1978. Tasty as most of the food is, the preparation and presentation is never more than casual, and is often closer to sloppy. The small room wherein the spread is layed out looks like brunch is just end ing no matter how early in the day you arrive. (Serving hours Sundays are 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.) Coffee is usually spilled and not cleaned up, bagel and doughnut crumbs are everywhere and spoons and knives covered with cream cheese and fruit butter lie haphazardly in and around various bowls and plates. Despite the appearance of the Valiant Trencherman as a kitchen used by a family of 14, the quality of the food is generally fine and echos in its freshness and variety the amiable qualities of the week day restaurant. There are three price levels for brunch at the Trencherman. For $2 -- which the management calls "" Humble"" -- patrons may choose from a dozen different kinds of bagels served with the aforemen tioned fruit butters and creamed cheese, a variety of doughnuts from Keeley's Bakery in Lewis burg, a selection of flavored cof fees and teas and three different fruit juices. At this level of the three-tiered brunch structure the spread is at its least unique and enjoyable. While the fruit butters -- apricot, raspberry and apple are the regulars -- the coffees and the teas offer flavors not found often on the local pallet, the bagels im ported from Baltimore definitely taste as if they have been travel ing a while, though toasting cures this ailment, and the juice is con sistently watery. As with most restaurants, things get better the more you pay. "" Modest"" brunchers sample from the $2 table plus a selection of Farm ers Market-bought cheeses and vegetables, home made sticky buns and -- the meal's highlight -- an excep tionally fresh and well-blended fruit salad. All this for $3 is a bargain... ...but, if you're willing to spend an extra dollar, the Trencher man's list of offerings really takes off. After taking from the "" Humble""  and "" Modest""  tables, "" Valiant""  customers arrive at a table laden with a crock of onion soup, fresh smoked salmon, creamed herring, two types of homemade quiche and a home made cassata (a Spanish pastry made with cottage cheese and orange rind). This is the table to linger at on Sundays in Lewisburg. While the quiche tends toward greasiness, it is tasty, and both the herring and the salmon will cure any case of the munchies when piled on a bagel -- no matter how rubbery. Graham and Muzyczka could not be more friendly and -- by their count -- brunch could hard ly be more popular. Bagels are consumed at the rate of 55 dozen each Sunday, and people stay well into the afternoon reading the Sunday papers spread around the two dining rooms. All Bucknellians should linger there at least once."

Other offensive threats are halfback Mickey Dillon, who scored three touchdowns against Southwestern, and speedy tight end James Jones, who has caught 11 passes for 235 yards thus far. The Wildcats play a 5-2 defensive alignment that is "" sound, with no major strengths,""  according to Bison quarterback A1 Locey '83. The one standout is 250 lb. noseguard Sven Pederson. The Bisons expect "" some stacks and stunting, but not too much blitzing,""  remarked Locey. The Wildcats rotate defensive backs, so Locey hopes to "" beat them deep when we catch the weak man in their rotation."" Davidson's defense is "" little, fast and likes to gang tackle""  according to tri-captain Dave Hibbard '81. The Wildcats will attempt to intimidate the Herd, but Locey is confident of a third straight vic tory, stating, "" We finally found out we can do it (last Saturday against Brown),""  so "" things should go well if we can keep our cool."""

M,c
C,"o n n e l l The Carlisle Old Gaelics spoiled the fall debut of Bucknell's rugby club as they edged the All-Blacks, 6-3, on Saturday. The All-Blacks, Eastern Pennsylvania Rugby Union division B champions a year ago, were outscored but not outplayed by the experienced Old Gaelics, who were making their fourth outing of the year. The All-Blacks' strong defensive performance in the scoreless first half proved to their arch rivals that they are a team to be reckon ed with. Many times, Carlisle pushed' inside Bucknell's 25-yard line, only to have their scoring threats nullified. The All-Blacks regained field position by taking several important five-yard scrums. Bucknell's first scoring chance came early in the second half when senior Steve Dixon's surprise drop kick from 25 yards faded to clear the uprights. The Gaelics came right back and scored the only try of the game on a breakaway to take the lead, 4-0. The conversion was successful, putting Carlisle in front by 6-0. The All-Blacks rallied and pushed deep into Gaelic territory. Dix on scored Bucknell's first points of the season by capitalizing on a penalty kick to close the gap to 6-3. However, time expired before the All-Blacks mounted another threat, and Carlisle was victorious. Good teamwork and several outstanding individual performances contributed to the quality of the All-Blacks' play. Scrum half Bob Rockwell '83 and John Lester '81 at second row performed well in their first-ever rugby test. Veterans Bill Charlton '81, Don DeAngelo '81 and Mike Yorio '83 also turned in stalwart performances. The All-Blacks host Juniata in a first-ever encounter next Satur day. Photo-- Dave Folsom"

"Soccer ties West Chester, 1-1;",
outscores Susquehanna by 3-1,"By BOB DAVIS "" It wasn't pretty, but it's a win,""  were Coach Craig Reynolds' words to the soccer team following Tuesday night's 3-1 victory over Susquehanna. The contest enabled the Bisons to boost their record to ""3*1. The teams ended what Reynolds termed a scary first half deadlocked at one goal apiece. The Bisons played well in the opening period, con trolling the tempo of the game, but failed to connect on their many scoring opportunities. Meanwhile, the defense was keeping the Crusaders handcuffed by allowing them only one real scoring threat, but Susquehanna was able to make that chance count, putting a header past goalie Pete Puccia '81 for a 1-0 lead. The advantage was short-lived, however, as the hooters' persistence paid off with a goal from sophomore Steve Goldenring. "" It was important for us to score before the half,""  noted Reynolds, adding that "" it prevented them from coming out and sitting on the lead."" The second half was characterized by sloppy play on the part of the Bisons, who rallied long enough to put two more goals on the board. The game-winner came on a header by midfielder Mark Brotherton '83 after an indirect kick had been awarded. From about 40 yards out, Fritz Shaak '81 chipped the ball high toward the goal where Brotherton directed it past the Crusader netminder. An insurance goal followed minutes later when Pat Christ '82 took a pass from senior Tom Rotelli, beat the Susquehanna defender for a breakaway and deposited the ball in the Crusader goal. Although he was happy with the victory, Reynolds was concerned with his team's play. "" We could've had more than three goals--we missed six good scoring opportunities. Someone's going to start ask- - ing why we aren't putting the ball in the net when we have the chance. We might be pressing too much."""

American Cancer Society,"The win had followed a 1-1 tie at West Chester last Saturday. The scenario in the first half there was much the same as in Tuesday's game. The hooters dominated the opening period, receiving little pressure from the Rams. Buckneli opened the scoring at about the 20 minute mark when Brotherton drilled a low shot toward the op posite post to beat the Ram goaltender. The second half proved different as West Chester came out fighting. "" They were pumped and we were flat--we were outplayed,"" commented Reynolds. "" I don't like to make excuses,""  said Reynolds, "" but the officials broke up the tempo of the game. They gave West Chester every opportunity."" Reynolds also noted that the game became very physical due to the interruptions and that "" things got out of control."" The Rams then benefitted from a bizarre series of events that resulted in the tying goal. The show began with an obstruction call against Rotelli, giv ing a free kick to West Chester. Then, in what Reynolds described as "" the worst thing I've ever seen as coach,"" the official "" misplaced the ball by 25 feet."" The ensuing play saw the Ram's shot ruffle the net behind Puccia. "" It would have been very difficult to score if the ball had been placed correctly,""  stated Reynolds, contending that the goal had resulted from the im proved angle afforded the Rams by the official's in correct placement. R e fo ld s cited lack of offensive production as contributing to Bucknell's problems: "" You can't win a lot of games on one goal."" The hooters square off against Rutgers at home Saturday at 1:00 p.m. and then travel to Penn State Tuesday. "" Rutgers is a real tough team,""  remarked Reynolds. "" We'll need one of our best games of the year to win. My biggest concern is getting our strongest unit healthy and ready to play."" The Bisons were bothered by injuries in their last two games, with several starters playing at less than 100 percent. Shaak, Rotelli and juniors John Krupka and Bob Brown are hampered by "" muscle pulls, sore feet, hyperextensions--nothing serious,"" according to Reynolds. Reynolds also intends to work on offense by in corporating more game simulation into practices, noting that "" We must increase our scoring percen tage. We move the ball well but we have to take it one step further."" "" We'll have to play better against Rutgers than we have in our last two games,""  he concluded."

The Bisons have a week to prepare for their next match Oct. 7 at Bloomsburg. By JEANNE MINAHAN Sent home in defeat tjiis week by both Mansfield State and Catholic University, the women's volleyball team watched their record sink to 1-6. A home ad vantage proved less dismal for the Bisons, however, as they stunned Susquehanna for their first victory, sweeping the Crusaders in three sets. On Wednesday, the spikers gave talented Mansfield a battle before losing, 4-15, 15-6, 1-15, Il ls. Mansfield was "" very strong, since they've had the same group of competitors for three years now,""  said Coach Terrie Grieb. The Bisons' serving improved, but their execution wasn't good, according to Grieb. The Bisons captured their first win of the season by dominating Susquehanna University 3-0 on Monday in Davis Gym. The Bisons have now defeated the Crusaders for three consecutive years. In the first game of the match, anxiety arose when Susquehanna jumped to an early 4-0 lead. However, the squad came back with a sustained effort, scoring the next 15 points to win the first game, 154. They followed with 15-2 and 15-6 scores to take the match. F reshm an Kathy Eckert "" overwhelmed them with her blocks, spikes and serve,""  ac cording to Grieb. Grieb also praised the excellent play of Ann Novasatka '83, senior captain S u san  B a i r s t o w . J e a n n e Groeneveld '83 was also com mended for her many spikes and dinks. The victory over Susquehanna was particularly encouraging because the team had just return ed from Washington, D.C. where they lost to a tough Catholic University squad on Sunday. With a 12-6 lead in the first game, the Bisons missed seven chances to win, and they lost 22- 20,15-2 and 15-8. Although Novasatka and senior Nina Kaminsky performed well, Grieb attributed the loss to "" a lack of hustle and poor serve reception.""  Bucknell will have another shot at the Cardinals when they travel to the LaSalle T o u r n a m e n t O c t . 31 in Philadelphia."

Herd upsets Brown as Jenkins stars,Photo--Charles Berul
Ken Jenkins '82 recorded his sixth career 100-yard game Saturday against,Brown
"to become the 12th leading all-time Bison rusher with 1,170 yards.",By STEVEN SKOLNICK and
MICHAEL SUAREZ,"Led by an outstanding performance by Ken Jenkins '82, who rushed 27 times for 192 yards and scored two touchdowns, the Bisons whipped Brown University, 28-20 last Saturday in Providence, R.I. Jenkins' efforts earned him ECAC Division I-AA Of fensive Player of the Week honors. Head Coach Bob Curtis called the win ""a Meanwhile, Brown scored on an 80-yard march when fullback Steve Curtin drove two yards over right guard to hit the end zone and put Brown on top, 7-0. The Herd offense was frustrated and when the defensive crew took the field they had no intention of staying there long. One play later the offense was back in charge as defensive back Doug Smoot '82 in tercepted a Larry Carbone pass on the The defense continued to thwart Brown's offensive efforts, as linebacker Pat Paro '81 jumped on a Carbone fumble to turn the ball back over to the offense. The Herd drove to the Bruin 20, where a holding penalty set them back to the 34- yard line. The drive looked to have stalled as Bucknell faced a third-and-26 situation, but Jenkins came through again. A1 Locey '83 dropped back as Jenkins cut across the middle of the field, picked up a key block and raced 36 yards for the score. The point after put Bucknell ahead, 14-7. But the Bruins had no intentions of quit ting, and when Brown's Tim Rualk return ed junior Ken Durr's punt after the next series 81 yards for a Brown score, the game was even once again. On Bucknell's next possession, Locey was intercepted and the ball was returned to the Bison 35. The Bruins offense looked to be on the move again. However, the Herd defense refused to bow, and the Bruins lost seven yards on their next possession, mainly due to a sack by Dave Hibbard '81. Forty-two yards and 49 seconds later the Herd tallied their third touchdown of the half on junior Rich Passerotti's spec tacular reception of a Locey aerial. Brown could do nothing in the remaining eight seconds and the Herd went into the locker room confident and ahead. The third quarter was a classic defen sive battle as the Herd held Brown to just 23 yards. Early in the fourth quarter, the Bisons missed a scoring opportunity, when Grennoh's 41-yard field goal attempt was wide. The Bisons allowed the Bruins only one first down before forcing yet another punt. Four plays later Jenkins headed for an open spot near the sideline. Just before he reached the hole, however, three pursuing Bruin defenders filled the gap. As one lunged at him, Jenkins backed up and reversed his field, leaving a trail of Bruin defenders in his wake. He sprinted 47 yards to the left corner of the end zone. Grennon's kick made the score Bucknell 28, Brown 14. The Bruins scored with 13 seconds left in the contest to close the gap to 28-20, but time expired and a jubilant Curtis was car ried off the field on the shoulders of his players. The football team tries for its third con secutive win on Saturday when it travels to Davidson to face the high scoring Wildcats. For a preview, see page 17."

__________________________,"great team victory,"" as the entire Bucknell squad gave an inspired per formance to topple the favored Bruins. From every indication in the first quarter, it looked to be a long afternoon for Bucknell. The Bisons had recovered a Brown fumble on the opening kickoff but couldn't put any points on the board as sophomore Bill Grennon's 28-yard field goal missed the mark. On the next series, Bucknell pieced together a sustained 11-play march that brought them into Brown territory, but again the drive sputtered. Bison 33-yard line. This time the Bison offense went to work behind the powerful backfield duo of Jenkins and Marshall Hall '83. The tandem ran the Herd down to the Brown 3 where they faced a fourth-and-two situation. The call went to right halfback Hall, who crashed his way over left guard to the one- yard line. Bucknell had a first down and four plays to hit pay dirt. They only needed one at tempt, as Hall plunged in over right guard. Grennon's conversion knotted the score at 7-7."

"helping the Bisons defeat Brown and MIT. Bucknell battled UCLA, last year's NCAA runner-up,",
to the wire before losing.,"By DAVE KIRKPATRICK PROVIDENCE, R.I. -  The men's water polo team ""probably played the best we've ever played as a unit,"" according to captain Scott Schulte '81, in winning two of three games at the Brown Tournament last weekend. The Bisons edged Brown, 6-5, then lost to powerful UCLA, 8-6, before trouncing MIT, 18-5. The season opener against Brown on Friday night marked the Bisons' first appearance in a longer 30-meter pool. Despite the unfamiliar pool and playing in front of a large Brown audience, the Bisons charged to a 5-1 lead after three quarters. Howevdr, Brown stormed back with four goals in the final quarter to tie the score. The Bisons regained their com posure at this point, and Tom Butler '82 scored his second goal of the game to send the Brown fans home disappointed. Scoring once apiece were Schulte, seniors Mark Gensheimer and Marc Corl and junior Dave Inglefield. Goalie Tony Paxton was outstan ding while making 10 saves. The Bisons' next challenge was mighty UCLA on Saturday morn ing. The B ruins defeated Bucknell, 17-7, in last year's NCAA championships on their way to a second place finish. Surprisingly, it was the Bisons who took charge early in the match, and Peter Weiman, '81, gave Bucknell a 1-0 lead midway through the quarter. Paxton was sparkling in the nets, and with the help of three UCLA shots that hit the post, the Bisons fought and scrapped to hold the lead to the end of the quarter. In the second quarter, UCLA started to establish itself more on offense and the result was four Bruin goals. Bucknell kept pace, however, by scoring three goals to end the half at 4-4. Schulte commented, ""We took advantage of six on five situations well."""

'successful' concert here,By
KEN QUAAS,"An estimated 1,900 Bucknell students in attendance at the Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes concert Saturday night in Davis Gymnasium was "" easily a record,""  according to Rich Schaberg '81, assistant chairman of the Bucknell Concert Commit- t66. "" It was the most successful show we've ever had in the sense of drawing Bucknellians together,"" he said. The concert committee "" will be within $500 of breaking even ac cording to Chris Petermann '81, chairman of the organization. The committee has "" no current plans for future concerts because right now the market is incredibly dry,""  Petermann said. He added that there are fewer bands touring at this time than before because of the energy crisis, and particularly, the high cost of fuel. The committee also has what he called "" considerable range limitations.""  These "" limitations""  include the small capacity poten tial--3,200--of Davis Gym and committee finances. "" We were lucky to get Southside,""  Petermann said. "" He was very inexpensive (a $7,500 talent fee for the band plus a $2,500 sum for the crew) and he's currently touring colleges in this area because that's where he thinks his fans are."" Touring small colleges is a "" thing of the past""  for most bands, ac cording to Schaberg. He said bands lose money playing to smaller crowds because of "" modern exorbitant expenses."" See COMMITTEE, page 16 By KEN WOLCKENHAUER A controversy over the ap propriation of more than $4,000 has the members of the Recyc ling Club engaged in a struggle with its form er advisor, Mechanical Engineering Pro fessor Charles Coder. The money, earned by the club for between 1972 and 1979, has been locked in a savings account by Coder, the club's trustee. Coder said the money, amoun ting to $4,633, will be saved and used as a scholarship fund which, he said, was the original intent of the recycling effort. The account is under his and University Treasurer Robert Shimer's names. According to Dean of Student Affairs John Dunlop, "" Our policy has been to respect the goals determined by the original members of a group such as the Recycling Club. We are relying on Professor Coder's word on those goals since he was one of the founders."" Dunlop said the University tries to protect the interests of groups that are formed with specific goals. Unless the univer sity finds strong evidence con trary, they would honor those goals, he said. Dunlop said if the Recycling Club wishes, it can have the ABS petition for a review of policy. The review, he said, would be given to determine what the club's funds were and whether the present members are entitled to control it. "" We would rather not engage in a review,"" Dunlop said, however. "" We're not sure what kind of an effect that will have on other clubs."" Recycling Club President Bob Dorns '81 said it was Coder's idea and never the official intent of the club's members to provide a scholarship fund. He said the money belongs to the club and its use should be at the club's discre tion. Dorns said the group would use the funds from the account for which Coder is a trustee to pursue the club's present goals, in cluding the renovation or pur chase of a paper baling machine. Baling recycled paper enables it to be resold at a much higher price than paper not machine-"

"Pew Trust donates $250,000 for computer center","By DAVID HAWKINGS The Pew Memorial Trust has donated $250,000 to the campaign for improved computer facilities here, putting the drive for the $2.8 million it will take to complete the project past the halfway point. University President Dennis O'Brien an nounced the gift -- received as a cashier's check in a letter Sept. 22 -- at the monthly faculty meeting Monday. The donation is the largest in the cam paign since the Fairchild Foundation gave the $1 million in May 1979 that started the computer improvement plans. The University has now collected or had pledged to it $1.7 million, according to Jerome Rackoff, the University's specialist in soliciting funds from founda tions and the federal government. Besides the Fairchild Foundation, other major supporters of the project have been the Merrill Trust, Western Electric Co. and the Booth Ferris Foundation. O'Brien said he hopes to finish the cam paign by the end of the academic year. He and Vice President for University Relations John Ferguson met with Pew Trust President Robert Smith as part of the application for the gift. The University did not ask the Pew Trust --founded by former Sun Oil Co. executive J. Howard Pew -- for any specific amount of money, Rackoff said. They did not know the amount of the gift until the cashier's check arrived in O'Brien's mail three weeks ago, he said. "" Tbe Pew Trust has been a steady and firm supporter of the University,""  O'Brien said, citing recent gifts of $200,000 to the Sports/Recreation Center campaign and a donation of $100,000 for an electron microscope. The trust is the second largest philan thropic organization in the country in terms of amount donated annually. The gift may be used to finance any of the three projects underway involving the computer center: the construction of the new building adjacent to the Dana Engineering Building, the purchase of new computer hardware system or the transferral of all information from the pre sent computer to the machine that is to be purchased. "" A few more gifts like this and we will be all set,"" O'Brien told the faculty. The announcement of the gift was the highlight of an otherwise uneventful 45- minute faculty meeting. After hearing reports from the five stan ding faculty committees, however, the 75 faculty members present heard a presen tation from Commputer Center Director Jon Eschinger, who said there are "" more than 7200 faculty programs in our system, and we don't know why many of them are there or what they are."""

Library's growing pains cause,
stacks to fill student lounge,"By TftICIA KENNEDY The second floor student lounge of the Ellen Clark Bertrand Library has been replaced with book stacks, because of the library's lack of "" adequate floor space,"" according to University Librarian George Jenks. The lounge was one of the few rooms in the library where smoking, eating, and drinking were not pro hibited. Vending machines for snacks and hot beverages were located adjacent to the room, but since con sumption of food was permitted only in the lounge, the machines were removed Wednesday. Jenks said the Kress Gallery -- adjacent to the former lounge -- may also be converted to a storage area for the overflow of books and reference materials unless another location for the material is found. The conversion of the rooms stems from the library's "" need of expansion,"" Jenks said. The pre sent library facility is "" not suitable today in terms of space needs,""  he added. The Library Facilities Planning Committee, formed in 1978, has been working on plans to expand the library. The function of the committee--which is chaired by Vice President for Administration and Finance John Zeller--is to take suggestions concer ning the library from the campus community and to make recommendations to the University, ac cording to Jenks. A report presented at a committee meeting in March 1979 said the library contained 66,100 square feet of floor space. Projections at that time in dicated that another 83,200 square feet--more than double the floor space available now--will have to be added in order to meet the library's needs by 1984. The additional space would allow for growth in bookshelf space, seating and study areas, and office space, according to the report. New facilities suggested in the report included storage lockers, a computer terminal, a theses area, and a "" late study room""  which would be kept open after the library's normal closing time. No actual plans for such expansion have yet been drawn up, Jenks said, adding that the construction of the new computer center here will put off any ac tion regarding the library for at least one year. No meetings have been scheduled for the library planning committee yet this year, Jenks said. Members of the committee include Professor of Spanish Mills Edgerton; Associate Professor of Biology, Richard Ellis; Professor of Sociology, John Kendrick, and Professor of History, Mark Neuman. Also on the committee are Physical Plant Direc tor John Bell, Director of Media Services Robert Dunkerly, Assistant Director of the Computer Center John Eschinger, and Assistant Librarian Nancy Weyant. Amy Jordan '81, Allen Haines '81 and Jenks are also on the committee. KnOto-- v-ari jensen"
Bookshelves now fill the room that served as the student,

"prompted the move, according to library officials.",
Food co-op started by students,"By CATHY NAGEL Students for a Cooperative Future -- a student food cooperative that hopes to offer a viable alternative to eating in the University's cafeteria -- has been soliciting new members this week in the University Center Mall. The group was formed last spring under direction of Gene Spagnoli '80 as a way for students to obtain nutritional foods through means other than the cafeteria plan. The program is offered again this year by a new coordinator, Lynn Jenkins '82. Karen Michelsen '82, Betsy Shrier '81 and"
ABS,"President John Dzurinko '81 are serving as co coordinators. The table in the mall has at tracted 37 people to sign up for participation in the cooperative, according to Shrier. Since most of these people will be buying food for an entire apartment, the total number of students she said will be using the system this year will be between 50 and 60., Each week, participants in the co-op will be given a form listing non-perishable food items, from which orders may be placed. The order forms will then be tallied and a collective order will be made to local participating stores. Six area food stores have agreed to let the co-op purchase large quantities of goods at dis- , counted prices of ten to forty per- i cent. ' When the order is returned, all m em bers are expected to separate and distribute the ordered items. Members are also responsible for the bookkeeping of the program. Each partici pant's responsibilities change on a weekly basis. The group will be using the Taylor Street House basement temporarily as a distribution headquarters for the co-op. Jenkins said if a room with kit chen facilities can be leased the group will be able to do its own baking. Although the food co-op might draw students away from the University Dining Service, Direc tor Henry (Hank) Ross has told the coordinators the group might be allowed to buy some food items through the cafeteria."
LYNN JENKINS,"Members will be expected to help pay the operating costs. There will be either an initial fee of about $10, or a slight food tax of 1 or 2 percent on the items, Jenkins said. Food selection during the first few weeks will include natural foods, such as grains, flours, cereals, canned goods, dried fruits, bean and alfalfa sprouts, breads, and cheeses. Jenkins ex- nrpsseri hone that the food selec tion will eventually include meat, fresh fruits and fresh vegetables. Those who participated in the cooperative last year estimated that buying food as part of the co op cost $5 to $10 less per week than buying a meal ticket, ac cording to Jenkins. The group hopes that if the cooperative is successful this year, it will be able to join with the Lewisburg Food Cooperative. A union of the groups would help in strengthening ties between the community and the University, .Tonlrins sairi"
Student Life committee seeks ideas,"The Student Life Committee, a recently revived branch of the ABS, is now exploring avenues for the diversification of social life on campus. The committee is concerned with "" any aspects of Bucknell life that are not academic or financial,"" according to Chairman Janice Meuller '83. She said the committee depends upon continuous feedback from the students "" to decide which issues and problems are in need of attention."" Recent suggestions, according to Meuller, have indicated a concern about a lack of "" social diversi ty""  here. Alternatives to the fraternity social life have been explored, and some--like Christy's Gate--have been successful, she said. Ten students serve on the committee in addition to Meuller. The committee is planning orientation programs for transfer students, and will provide assistance to the University Counseling Service in the administering of a psychological survey for students next semester. Meuller said the committee has "" absolute dependence""  on student feedback for it to be mean ingful."

Recycling fund contested,"From RECYCLING, p**el The funds in the club's treasury have remained under his control, however. "" It's a matter of principle. I wouldn't want us to go back on our word. I support the scholar- ' ship alternative. We will be doing something good for the communi ty as well as supporting the recycling effort,""  Coder said. Although the club opened a new account under its new advisor, assistant professor of physics Jeffrey Bowen, Coder has not relinquished control of the funds. The group said it needs the money from Coder's account to pursue its present goals, in cluding baling its own paper to sell at a higher price. Doms said he is prepared to in itiate legal action with the sup port of the club. He said Coder "" lost involvement in the club long ago. He is looking for just his so- called promises to the townj' Doms, who will graduate in May, said "" after I graduate, time won't be a bother--I'll do anything I can to get the money."" #Hje club has no constitution or by-laws specifying goals and aims. Records have been kept of the minutes of meetings, letters, and reports dating back to 1973, however. Club objectives were not set until 1975, when the group was faced with declining paper prices because of the economic recession. The club possessed $1,500 at that, time and was asked to list priorities about the utilization of that money. According to the minutes of the officer's meeting on Feb. 22,1975 -- which Doms made available to the Bucknellian -- goals were proposed in priority order. It was proposed that the club's first priority be the "" expansion of the program, using funds to buy equipment and materials deemed necessary and beneficial for the program."" Proposed as a second priority was a "" pledge of money to sup- port the production of the Bucknell Environmental News."" A "" scholarship and/or other alternatives"" was suggested as the third--and lowest--priority of the club. However, some records of minutes have been lost, Coder said, and there is no physical evidence the proposal was passed by the general membership. Doms said he spoke to three past presidents of the club and they told him the goals as pro posed at that meeting by the club members were passed."
Fraternity,
bomb scare closes,
street and forces evacuation,"By MATT KARANIAN A bomb threat was received at the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity house at 12:50 a.m. Thursday warning that a party in progress at the fraternity "" was going to blow up,"" according to Lewisburg Police Chief Donald Heiter. Police evacuated 80 people afrom the building after the threat was made by an anonymous telephone caller. Police have no leads or suspects in the case. Heiter said Lewisburg police received a call for assistance from Fiji president Steve Papariello '81 at 12:57 a.m. Papariello said Fiji member Dave Marren '83 received the bomb threat when he answered the house phone. Marren informed Papariello of the threat, and Papariello said he "" took a couple of minutes to decide whether it was a prank or real."" He said he then decided "" to be safe,""  and sum moned police a few minutes after the threat was made. Police arrived "" a minute or two later, Papariello said. Heiter said he closed Universi ty Ave. -- the street on which the fraternity is located -- from Barton St. to Malcom St. Police searched the fraternity for explosive devices but found nothing and gave up the search at 2:30 a.m. Although he was not using "" special equip ment,""  Heiter said he could have identified a bomb. If an explosive device had been found, Heiter said he would have "" cleared the whole block,"" and notified a "" bomb disposal unit and demoli tion team."" Although no bomb was found, Heiter said he told fraternity members at the time that he could not "" guarantee""  there was no bomb. He estimated 40-60 people re-entered the building. The others who were evacuated, most of whom had been attending a party the fraternity was sponsoring, left the area. Bucknell security officers also responded to the call for assistance from the fraternity. Papariello said he had "" no idea""  who might have phoned the bomb scare. "" I guess it was just a prank. Somebody must have gotten a kick out of it."""

Nurse's absence has,

CounseLine has 185 listeners,
of tapes about social problems,"By M ADELON HENEHAN CounseLine, the University telephone counselling and referral service, has received 185 inquiries since its reintroduction Sept. 26. CounseLine, initiated by the Counseling Service and the Office of Residential Life, provides 54 taped messages dealing with social problems. ^The messages may be heard by phoning on a special line and requesting a desired topic. The messages are run 7 to 9 minutes long each. Located in the Counseling Service office in the Botany Building, CounseLine phones are manned by the counseling staff during their office hours and by upperclass volunteers after hours. If the lines are not in operation when a person calls, an answer ing machine provides a phone number to call in case of emergency. CounseLine began its operations in September 1978 after investing $325 in Self-Help tapes from the University of Texas, counseling service. According to Arlene Hoyt of the service, the rationale behind the program is "" to reach students and to let them know there are people on campus interested in their personal and psychological well being."" Almost 600 calls were answered in 1978, but the number of calls decreased in following years. Hoyt said reasons for the decline included, "" understaff ing""  and the program's "" not being in people's minds."" Although total calls are tabulated, there is no way of estimating the actual number of students who use the phone, Hoyt said. "" But 35 to 40 percent of the students will have some contact with the Counseling service in the four years they are here,""  she added. CounseLine does not operate after 6 p.m. weekends. Hoyt said she would "" love to see""  hours extended. "" I'd like coverage, but it's hard to find students to answer the phones,"" she said. By MATT KARANIAN The Women's Concern Group is initiating a petition calling for the temporary placement of a woman nurse or doctor on the stu dent medical services staff. The staff now consists entirely of men, and the women's group is seeking to have a woman serve in addition to the men as a gynecological practitioner. Rozalyn Yannaccone, a nurse practitioner in gynecology, served as the medical service's only female practitioner from September 1978 until June. She is now on a maternity leave of absence and she will not return to work until Feb. 1. There are no women now on the staff, and the Women's Concern Group wants to see a woman hired "" at least temporarily""  ac cording to group spokesman Don na Spinweber '81. University Medical Director Dr. Joseph Weightman said there are no plans to fill her post as practitioner. Although Weight- man said he "" appreciates having a nurse of feminine gender for girls,""  he said the male doctors have been "" doing it for years"" and are "" competent profes sionals."" Weightman said the dispensary can take care of any medical pro blems women have. Although "" individuals prefer the same gender""  for medical matters, it is "" all a part of their work""  for the male doctors, he said. The medical services can func tion properly in dealing with emergencies until Yannaccone returns from her leave Feb. 1., Weightman said. "" Illnesses are taken care of""  and birth control counseling is still provided, he"
ROZALYN YANNACCONE,"said. Weightman said he has heard no complaints from students because of Yannaccone's tem porary leave. "" Students may say 'Oh I wish she were here,' but there have been no problems,"" the medical director said. Spinweber said women here do not feel comfortable with the male doctors. Yannaccone said she provides the same services as the male doctors at the dispensary. "" If someone needs an exam they can still get it,""  she said. "" I guess what the women really miss is someone to talk to when they have problems. Most of my time was spent answering ques tions and giving advice "" Yannaccone was hired two years ago following persistent complaints from undergraduate women that a female was needed on the medical staff and the subsequent reccommendation to that effect by a student and facul ty committee."

FM  power increase delay over,
JL,"... .. . j.- nn fnroppahlp pause for further dela; By NANCY McMANUS After a delay caused by a prolonged engineering study, University radio station WVBU has accepted a proposal from  Radio Systems Inc. to purchase $23,000 of equipment necessary to increase its power. The FM station will be increasing its power to 456.8 watts stereo by the start of the spring semester, according to Station Manager Liz Hawley '80. The Federal Communications Commission ruled in 1979 that 10-watt educational stations must increase their power to at least 100 watts, or be forced off the air. WVBU filed with the FCC for a power increase in June, 1979, and received a construction permit from the Commission to increase its power to 11,169 watts June 12. A power increase of this magnitude would have enabled the station to be heard as far as Williamspost. The station was also granted permission to move its tower from  its present location on the roof of Roberts Hall to a tower owned by a local radio station WTCG on Armor Road in Lewisburg. These plans, however, were contingent upon a National Telecommunications In formation Administration grant of $30,000. The NTIA did not make any of the funds available. Without the NTIA grant, the radio station could not afford to increase its power to the originally proposed wattage."
WVBU,"is therefore in the process of revising its ap plication to the FCC for a modified power in- crease. WVBU is also seeking to transfer its tower site to the roof of the power house at the Physical Plant building, rather than to a site provided by WTGC. Hawley said this amendment was to be resubmitted to the FCC this week. Before WVBU was able to draft a new pro posal to the FCC, a new engineering study had to be completed. The study was required by the FCC to demonstrate that the increase in power would not interfere with the broadcast signals of nearby stations. Last year, Ed Perry, a consulting engineer from  Rombury, Mass., contracted with WVBU to complete the engineering study, which he promised to complete by March. His consulting firm  was exceptionally busy, however, and maps for the study were not completed until last month. This six month delay of the results of the engineering study caused WVBU's delay in increasing its power. Although it may be a matter of months before WVBU hears from  the FCC on its new amendment to increase to 456.8 watts, there is no forseeable cause for further delay, ac cording to FM Program Director Jay Cresswell '81. Cresswell said the FCC will most likely approve the revision since it calls for less of an overall power increase than the originally planned increase. The proposal from  Radio Systems was ac cepted Friday after a meeting attended by John Zeller, Jerry Rackoff, John Dunlop, Dean of Student Affairs, Roland King, WVBU station advisor, and the station's Board of Directors. WVBU will be purchasing equipment in cluding a 40-foot tower, a transmitter, an emergency broadcasting system encoder, and a stereo monitor.

"Apartheid, racism, subject of",
lecture by Brown U. professor,"By STEVE GARFINKEL Comprehensive economic sanc tions against South Africa are not likely to be productive, according to Professor and Chairman of the Department of Political Science Newell Stultz of Brown Universi ty. He spoke to an audience of 75 persons in the University Center Forum Tuesday night as a guest of the annual James Gathings Lectureship in International Relations. Stultz's hour-long presentation, ""Thinking About South Africa: A Reexamination of Some Maxims and Axioms,"" drew heavily from a 1964 article by Philip Mason, he said. Mason's article, an effort describg the ""lines of policy"" that the United States and Great Britain should take regarding aparthied in South Africa, presented some axioms-- postulations of foreign policy- regarded as true, and some maxims--policy prescriptions-- based on these axioms. Stultz described and explained each maxim. The U.S. and Bri tain prefer friendship in dealing with South Africa, and are deter mined to see the ""graceful retire ment"" of the government of South Africa, he said. The U.S. and Britain should ex plicitly state this as their goal, Stultz said. Mason's article also advocated a minimum amount of bloodshed in South Africa during the change of government. ""South Africa is the world's business"" and the United Nations must develop a policy which ex emplifies this stance, Stutz told the mixed audience of students and faculty. Mason's axioms also included an assertion that in dependent internal revolution in South Africa is not likely to be successful. The ""former Nixon administra tion stance"" on this was that the whites of South Africa are there to stay, and effective change can be reached only through them, Stultz said. ""The South African govern ment will not fail through weakness,"" and direct armed in tervention in South Africa is not advisable, Stultz said, as South Africa is now a formidable power. Prosperity will not be an acceptable type of compensation for or lead to an end of aparthied in South Africa, he said. Economic sanctions or naval blockades of South Africa are likely to cause resentment from neighboring countries in the region, since trade would be in terrupted at other points and thus affecting other countries, Stultz said. Stultz continued his recounting of Mason's axioms by stating that general sanctions are unlikely to be successful without the par ticipation and support of the U.S. and Britain. In this case, he said, these two countries would have to consult with other nations who do not possess United Nations veto power, such as Japan and West Germany. Since South Africa has diver sified the nations with which she trades, there are many practical difficulties in coordinating a trade embargo with ""a high level of effectiveness,"" he said. Multinational corporations can ""easily avoid"" the constraints placed upon them by govern ments, Stultz said, and therefore a trade embargo is unlikely to be very effective in combating apar thied, according to his recounting of Mason's article. Stultz explained five alter natives which, in light of Mason's maxims and axioms, would pro mote ""democracy in South Africa without bloodshed."" A comprehensive economic sanction is an alternative that likely will not take place, Stultz said. The U.S. and Britain are too economically tied to South Africa to simply divest all interests in that country, he said. Trade is especially important to Britain, for it controls one-third of the total investments in South Africa. The value of South African in vestments have increased three and one-half times. This explains why countries that deal with South Africa refuse to vote for sanctions, while those who are E S I"

"Newell Stultz, professor of political science at Brown Univers",
"ity, speaks Tuesday in the University Center Forum about",
apartheid policies in South Africa.,"not tied economically advocate sanctions, Stultz said. There also exists two inherent ly opposed alternatives. One is to increase spending and develop ""intensified economic"" policies toward South Africa. This, ac cording to Stultz, would break down aparthied through in creased economic prosperity. Economic growth, however, does not equal the breakdown of pre judice through sharing of wealth, he said. Disengagement or divesture, instead, would break down the links in South African society, thus destroying aparthied. Stultz said this would abandon the ""con tribution to democracy"" and would dispel the fact that South Africa is the world's business."
O'Brien to meet with Sullivan Principles' founder,"By GREG HAHN University President Dennis O'Brien will meet in New York City Wednesday with the creator of the Sullivan principles. The principles--a standard of corporate conduct designed to safeguard and promote the welfare of South African blacks in employment, housing, educa tion and health-- are a key ele ment in the University's tentative plan for selective divestiture of University holdings of companies that have subsidiaries in South Africa. O'Brien was invited to attend a meeting with the Rev. Leon Sullivan by a group of college presidents including Swarthmore College president Theodore Friend. He said he is not sure of the specific agenda. The University's board of trustees voted in December 1979 to boycott companies which did not follow the Sullivan guidelines as a protest against South African apartheid."
A,"committee of trustees chaired by John P. Swanson of Tenafly, N.J. is in the process of determining which of the com panies in which the University has holdings follows the Sullivan principles. Despite dwindling member ship, the Bucknell Alliance Against Aparthied (BAAA) is ac tively seeking total divesture of University stocks in corporations with affiliates in the Republic of South Africa. Two years ago, the BAAA had support of 100 more students and faculty members, but less than a dozen students and faculty are active with the organization to day. The BAAA has set a short- range goal of educating the Bucknell community about apar theid. The group does not believe selective divesture to be the right move. BAAA co-coordinator Carolyn Berner '81 said the Sullivan Prin ciples are not specific enough and do not provide for any voting privileges or participation in the government. She said the prin-"
r,"ciples have not been effective and blames the vagueness of the rating system for this. Masato Aoki '82, another BAAA co-coordinator, said there is ""ex treme"" racial segregation and rule by the minority in South Africa. He described cir cumstances where blacks -- who comprise nearly three-fourths of the population--are prohibited from voting and are limited to menial jobs by the white ruling class. Apartheid in South Africa specifically is a policy of segrega-"
1,"tion and political discrimination against non-European groups. BAAA member Karen Michelsen '82 describes the situation as ""legalized slave labor."" The University has more than $3 million in assets invested in firms that have affiliates operating in South Africa. In- dustries located in the republic must abide by the laws of the area. These companies include IBM and Exxon. The BAAA wants the Universi ty to withdraw all its stocks from these corporations to protest the suppression of non-whites by the Afrikaaners, the white majority."

Some of the ships were in the process of relocating from the dockside berths they occupied to the center of the waterway because of increased hostility and fighting on the shore. The incident proves that there are Iranians entrenched in the ci ty despite Iraqi claims of total control in the area. The war bet ween Iran and Iraq has been going on for 18 days, with both sides claiming to have the ad vantage in the conflict. None of the ships involved in the shelling were from either of the warring countries.

The lecture was presented to a sparse audience in the University Center Forum. According to Dr. Mallory, "" Death is destiny, universal, solitary and compulsory."" Certain facts about death are and will remain the same, but other aspects of it change. Mallory said death was natural andpersonal in the 19th century-an individual died at home, surrounded by fam ily. Conversely, Mallory said that in the 20th century death is vastly different as the modem hospital has become the site for death; a place where family members are "" removed.""  Mallory said death has there are attitudinal changes about death. Doctors have become more open in telling patients they are dying. While Bauer expressed concern over the solitude of death and the difficulty of facing it, he defended the physician who did not become emotionally in volved in a patient's death. Although he agreed with Mallory that "" someone has to help reconcile a patient and his family to the facts of death, he maintained that it was not the job of the doctor. "" There is very little room for philosophical or emotional development in the training of physi cians. We are overloaded with information and time commitments. It's impossible to spend that extra"
hour,"talking to the patient,""  Bauer said. Lumpkin then offered his definition of dehumanization to the audience and built his argu ment around that. According to Lumpkin, "" Dehumanization is isolation."" ,, "" We must treat the person with the disease, Lumpkin said, "" rather than the disease that's got the person.""

Pulling the purse strings,
Remember when you were young and Aunt Ella gave you some,
money or you earned a few cents somehow? Wasn't it frustrating if,
"Mom wouldn't let you buy that candy bar, the way you wanted to?",
"The Recycling Club has a bank account of $4,633 comprising its",
"earnings from 1972-79. Bob Doms '81, president of the club, wants to",
use the money in part to bale the paper to be recycled for a better,
"sale price. With the increased funds earned from this innovation, the",
club could expand its objectives.,
_,
.,
"Presently, the recycling effort on campus is severely hindered",
"by a lack of collection boxes, student awareness, and administration",
concern and support. There is no organized effort for aluminum,
"reclamation. Instead of making money, the University pays to have",
its many recyclables towed away to a landfill.,
$4 633 could do a lot for the Recycling Club and their badly need,
"ed efforts here -- but Professor Charles Coder, club advisor until",
"last year, tenaciously refuses to allow the club access to the money it",
has earned. The funds are in an account under his name and he says,
he will not allow them to be used for anything other than a scholar-,
S PDoms says that the use of the money should be left to the club's,
discretion. He is right.,
.,
.,
Student organizations are not meant to be controlled by their ad,
visors. Nor their past advisors. The money earned by the Recycling,
"Club does not belong to Coder,",
This is college -- not kids and candy bars. The issue is not,
whether Coder's designations for the money are more worthy than,
the intentions of the Recycling Club. The fact is that Coder and the,
University are overstepping their bounds.,
After the lounges go,
The student lounge on the second floor of the Ellen Clarke Ber,
"trand Library was a room on which students were allowed to smoke,",
eat and drink. The room's atmosphere was markedly more relaxed,
when compared to the rigid structure of much of the rest of the,
building.,
...,
.,
",",
_,
. . .,
The lounge is now jammed full to the ceiling with stacks of books,
and the vending machines that dispensed snacks and drinks have,
been carted away.,
The lounge was occupying valuable floor space in the library --,
an increasingly scarce commodity as the library's number of,
volumes grows and its physical size remains the same.,
But the loss of the student lounge is not particularly lamentable.,
Few libraries permit eating or drinking within their enclaves and,
this is a reasonable rule. The students who must smoke while study,
ing can still use the basement study room.,
What is of lament is that the library has closed its only student,
lounge as a quick fix for its growing pains. The adjacent Kress,
Gallery is on death row for the same reason.,
It has long been painfully evident that the current library,
facilities are rapidly becoming inadequate and overburdened. Ob,
viously the University should begin drawing specific plans for the,
expansion of the facilities. This expansion should be granted the top,
priority among the University's capital improvement plans for the,
1980s.,
Missing practitionist,
A nurse-practitioner specializing in gynecology was employed,
by the University in the fall of 1978 after much student and faculty in,
put. Her duties were to instruct classes and seminars and to provide,
women with both gynecological exams and sexual counseling.,
Student response to Rozalyn Yannaccone was heavy; there was,
a marked increase in the number of women requesting exams and,
an even greater number approached the nurse for counseling. But,
Yannaccone has taken a semester's leave of absence and will not,
return until Feb. 1.,

The administration was remiss both in failing to adequately in,

"sidering student response to the post, a part time replacement",
should be provided for immediately. It is unfortunate that only male,
doctors remain to undertake the nurse's duties for the rest of the,
semester.,

"Alumni, Volvos, argyles, &  patches","By SCOTT BUCHHOLZ The "" Welcome Home Bucknellians""  banner over Moore Avenue alerts all members of the Bucknell community of this weekend's extravaganza known as Homecoming. In fleets of Volvos alumni travel great distances to their alma mater, Universitas Bucknellensis. Throughout the United States, from Scarsdale to Chevy Chase, the urge to return to one's collegiate home beckons. What can be said of these former inhabitants of Kress, Roberts, Swartz and Larison? Why do they return to Bucknell? Surely a receding hairline Mid a bit of a paunch around the midsection are nothing to show off. But when you think of it, most alumni probably display the same characteristics. Radical alumni would have us think that Homecoming is a plot by capitalists in the Universi ty fund raising office toincrease annual giving. This may be true, but do we really need another park bench? Probably the most interesting thing about Homecoming is learning that clothing styles do not change much after graduation. The way our alumni wear their clothes is a bit different. The mono- grammed sweaters are still in. However, the alum ni bring us a new fixation, patches. I can't decide if this innovation is a result of age or style. Patches are a very common item in the wardrobe of former Bucknellians, whether on corduroy jackets or wool sweaters. I have even noticed pat ches on Bucknell's favorite sock, the argyle. There is also the biggest patch of all--the patch work pants that remind me of walking bed quilts. To see an alumnus in that costume makes me wish it were summer. But enough about these collegiate forms of dress the purpose of which is to relate to times past. There is more to the alumni than the outward appearance they bring back to Bucknell. They carry minds full of memories of fraternity parties and football games. Their stories are retold and retold and... The alumni trying to prove themselves against undergraduates in events such as swimming, soc cer and beer drinking has to be seen to be believed, Unfortunately for the undergraduates and their egos, it is often unbelievable. And so the spectacle will occur this weekend Besides Bucky's Place, the parade and football game, we will be treated to an open-air fashion show of traditional collegiate styles, including patches and a look at this year's new Volvos. They have returned. _______________ Scott Buchholz '81 Is an economics and political science major from. Toms River, N.J."

ByERICHOERNER,"Faced with three dubious choices in this year's Presidential elec tion, it is doubtful that American voters will elect a winner Nov. 4. The new dimension of a third candidate means there will be two official losers on Election Day. Two non-candidate losers have emerged already however : the English language and logical rhetoric. Political campaigns are often mass exercises in hyperbole, but this year the abuses are especially blatant. For example, on Tuesday in Chicago President Carter told a crowd, "" You'll have to determine whether America will be unified or, if I lose the election, whether America will be separated, black from white, Jew from Christian, North from South, or rural from urban."" On military policy Carter claims that Reagan would "" lead our coun try into war."" Ronald Reagan responded to the remarks by saying that Carter's at tacks had reached a "" point of paranoia""  and called him a "" badly misinformed and predjudiced man."" He did not ask for a personal apology, but called for Carter to apologize to the American people. This response was reserved considering the severity of Carter's remarks. It would be easy to make a list of Reagan's outrageous and impractical statements. Both candidates are guilty of using the usual campaign exaggera tions. But Carter's extreme remarks transcend hyperbole and demean the office of the President. Carter should concentrate more on his own record rather than personally attacking his opponent._________________ _ Eric Hoerner '81, an accounting major from Easton, Pa., Is opinions editor of the BuckiwNian."

The Captain's 25th anniversary,
j,
CAREFREE,"By DAVID O'CONNELL While the rest of the campus whisk themselves away into the dark recesses of Coleman Hall and Dana Engineering each mor ning at 8 a.m., those of us for tunate enough to avoid morning classes are witnessing television history. We're reliving the days of our youth--returning to the magic kingdom of the Dancing Bear and Bunny Rabbit. The occasion? It's Captain Kangaroo's 25th anniver sary on television. Last week, the pudgy Captain (B o b K ee sh a n ) and his emaciated cohort Mr. Green Jeans (Hugh "" Lumpy""  Bran- num) celebrated the monumental date at an anniversary bash in New York City. For those who complain of the rapid disappearance of tradi tional American institutions, they need look no further. Captain Kangaroo, whether we realize it or not, has been an influential figure in our formative years. How many Bucknellians would feel secure if the Grandfather Clock chimed no more? It's a sub conscious feeling for some, but we are confident in the knowledge that every morning the sun will rise on the one show that has transcended Leave it to Beaver, Lost in Space, and The Waltons. Such an American institution cannot go unrecognized. If I had just one bunch of carrots, I 'd give them to the Captain--with an honorary degree from Bucknell.

Johnny and Ellen were tantalizing and deafening,". . . . . . , ______ ___________ .. threw DaDer at them. Sc By TODD G. BUCHHOLZ My right ear is starting to hear again. It went on strike for a week to protest the sound levels it was subjected to during the Southside Johnny concert Satur day night. At the next concert, I 'll know not to sit on the floor close to the speakers. Benjamin Franklin said, "" experience is the hardest school, but fools will learn in no other."" Ben was right. I learned my lesson. As for the concert, it was an ap parent success. And the Concert Committee achieved its goal of starting the year with a winner. I was most impressed, though, with Southside's personal ap pearance. How many performers still wear white shirts and black ties? Had I known the concert was a formal affair, I would have dressed a little better. The fact that Southside--in a fit of artistic inspiration--ripped off his tie five minutes later doesn't"

STOP,"change anything. He looked clean-cut, neat and well-dressed. In fact, when I first saw him, I thought he was a high school kid applying for admission to Bucknell. Maybe the Davis Gym stage is one of the admission's tour stops. Southside's singing was pretty good, too. Frankly, I didn't know what he said most of the time, but he sounded as if he had a decent voice. The Asbury Jukes were ex emplary. The brass and sax ophone sections added a lot of en thusiasm to the show. My favorite group, though, was the audience. Nearly 2500 people sitting on one another's laps in a mass touchy-feely session. Those of us on the floor of the gym  started off comfortably. There was very little pushing or shoving to find a seat. Officer Mike had implored us not to push our way in like a herd of Bison. "" Please take your time so young ladies and whatnot won't be crushed,""  he said. So far so good. But when Ellen Shipley came on stage, everyone jumped to their feet and crept forward, closer to the stage. Five minutes later, when students wanted to sit down again, the gym floor seemed to have shrunk. You had to revert to the fetal position to find a piece of the floor. Most people managed, ex cept for the two in front of me who didn't sit down quickly enough. They looked around like the losers in a game of musical chairs. There was absolutely no room left. Soon the pelting began. Students who couldn't see through the two people standing threw paper at them. Scientific types created supersonic transport planes out of their pro grams. The two looked like the targets of a kamikaze mission. Finally, they crawled over the crowd and escaped. Throughout this whole sordid escapade, Ellen continued to charm and tantalize. If you thought Southside was dressed by Halston, or at least Calvin Klein, consider Ellen. Her jeans were so tight she had to hunch over like an anthropoid. She was a philosopher too, screaming things like: "" You've gotta make a promise to yourself and keep it--no matter what! And it gets rough! Uh-huh, Doobee UH-huh!""  She was a real Aristotle--or at least an O'Brien."

At Princeton, the new female students were asked recently to recount in as explicit detail as they could their most intimate sexual experiences -- and on Princeton stationery as well. The school actually has a center for the study of human sexuality, but the staff there knew nothing about the questions that were asked on the center's forged let terhead. Nobody else seems to either. Local printers, students and faculty questioned as part of a "" fullscale inquiry""  by the ad ministration are silent ... and so now are most of the freshman women when asked to tell the school anything more personal than their name. At Yale, the physical plant peo ple decided to fix some leaky faucets, a few disheveled roofs and some faulty old wiring -- to the tune of $4 million. It must be nice to have that kind of money to do the things our Physical Plant appears to do for free. No one is saying their work is free, but have you ever heard of John Bell announcing he was spending twice the cost of the new com puter center on things like broken windows and faulty jukeboxes in the Bison? sciences with more money back ing it than we receive in annual giving. Our fledging program in that discipline -- long in the mak ing and constantly strapped for funds -- could operate com fortably for 10 years on that specialized endowment in Ithaca. Dartmouth continues to be name conscious. Just concluding a controversy concerning the traditional Indian mascot (it was decided the symbol implied a racial slur), the Hanover campus is now embroiled in a dispute about a secon d student newspaper's desire to use the word "" Dartmouth""  in its name. Both controversies would seem moot here. If anyone were to criticize the use of the locally ex tinct bison, it would have been when the beast died long ago. As for the emergehce of a second paper here... because he was not named presi dent. Maybe he sounds like a sore loser to you, but when was the last time Wendell Smith or any other University official was en dorsed by both students and faculty for a promotion -- and still did not get it? Brown has been in the local news lately, sending three of its professors here to teach while we sent football and water polo teams to trounce their opposing forces. What does that say about their priorities, or our true assets? Harvard remains conspicuous by its silence. Perhaps they are embarrassed at not having an alumnus in the White House for the past 17 years. A ll the ru m ors about Bucknell's asking or being asked to join the Ivy League are and have always been false. For bet ter or worse, we are not in their league, and they are not in ours. For all the money, age and prestige historically bestowed upon the ivy-covered eight, Bucknell's humbleness on all counts puts it in a class by itself.

The parade begins Saturday at 10:30 a.m. at the Lewisburg High School and will proceed up Market Street to Third Street, then up Moore Avenue through campus. One of the highlights of the parade will be the debut of the Roy Grier Botswick Kit chen Band. Membership was open to all the cafeteria workers, who will be mar ching to their beat of pots, pans and other kitchen utensils. However, the Bostwick Band is not the only kitchen band to be ap pearing in the parade. The New Columbia For a switch in musical tastes, there will also be a Dixieland band playing songs like "" Hello Dolly,""  "" When the Saints Go Mar ching In,""  and "" Basin Street Blues."" Members of the Dixieland Band include Scott Armacost '82 on trumpet; Rick Focke '80, trombone; Joe Fantuzzi '80, piano; Bob Ritter '83, drums; Assistant Professor of Philosophy Richard Brockhaus on tuba, and Mark Krauss, '74, with clarinet. The Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity's kazoo band will only be appearing "" if the float falls through,""  said float chairman Sam Niness '82. The float theme is "" Score on the Leopards""  and will feature a Bison crushing or running over the Lafayette leopard. Alpha Chi Omega sorority and Delta Up- silon fraternity are combining their talents for another of the floats. Gordie Stetz '83"
The Bison Marching Band is slated to perform at halftime Saturday. With,

All of their members are more than 70 years old and will be riding on a flatbed truck. More traditional music will be provided by the Bison Marching Band, the Lewisburg High School Band and the Bucknell Alumni Band. The Alumni Band has more than 90 members returning to play, notably Vice President for Ad ministration and Finance John Zeller '41 on the cymbals. Dave Maahr, the 1975 PGA champion and an ABC Sports commentator, will be in the parade as part of the celebration honoring the Golf Club's 50th anniversary. In addition, the alumni who initiated the club will be riding through in golf carts. Associate Professor of Japanese Studies James Pusey will not be appearing in any of the bands, but his music will still be prominent--he'll only be playing the bagpipes. Pusey got involved in the parade only by chance. One of the Homecoming Committee members spotted the "" Support Your Local Piper""  bumper sticker on the back of his car and left a message for him to join. If the weather cooperates, Pusey plans to wear a kilt and full regalia. _______ will be sitting on top of a Bison lancing a leopard "" a stuffed leopard, not a real one.""

Beta Gamma sorority and Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity's theme is "" Knock the Spots Off the Leopards."" Many of the groups were experiencing difficulties in getting flatbed trucks, but entries are expected from fifteen sororities and fraternities and several freshman hall groups. Concern and Action also plans to enter a float and are decorating their van with "" possibly the six foot Earth ball,"" said Homecoming chairperson Ginny Bagley '81.

""The nightclub atmosphere is something both current students and alumni can relax in. The entertainment appeals to all different people,"" concluded Christie. One facet of ""Bucky's Place"" that is not available to everyone on campus is the cash bar, open to all those of legal drinking age, run by the Bull Run Inn, that will operate throughout the night. ""They're go ing to be carding,"" said Todisco. Todisco, along with 40 other students working on nine different committees, has been in cooperation since last spring with Ronald Pedrick, director of Alumni Rela tions and assistant director, Ray Painter, to provide activities for this weekend. ""All together, I estimate that one hun dred students have been involved in plann ing and carrying out all the activities,"" said Todisco. .

"Petermann, Schaberg discuss",
pursuit and hiring of bands,"By KEN QUAAS "" It's anti-climactic for us,"" Chris Petermann '81, chairman of the Concert Committee, said in reference to the live performance of the band his committee had signed. In an interview with the Bucknellian Monday night, Petermann and Rich Schaberg '81, the com mittee's assistant chairman, described the mechanics and considerations involved in schedul ing a concert here. ' . The two days before the concert are the most hectic,""  according to Petermann. "" You dont sleep much Friday night worrying that something -- anything -- will go wrong."" These final days are when ""we get to see the results of a lot of hard work,""  Petermann said. The chairman begins his committee's search for performers by phone, contacting the committee s two liaisons with the professional music business, Monarch Entertainment and Harris Goldberg Con cert Ideas, both of New York City. "" I call them and they give me a list of availabilities and fees. They know our capabilities and limitations, both financially and with the gym, and tell us who we can't have right off the bat, Petermann said. From this narrowed list, the committee then votes on which band they think would be most ap propriate for performance here. "" When we choose, we can't just look at the Bucknell community, because we have to rely on good sales in the surrounding area as well. We have to come as close as we can to selling our 3,200 capacity,"" Petermann said. According to Schaberg, a band can be popular with students here but still not be "" economically feasible"" for consideration by the committee. He cited as an example the Renaissance concert of April 1977, which drew a crowd of 1,400 Bucknellians but still lost money. "" We were considering the Talking Heads before Southside,""  Petermann said, "" but we didn't feel they were worth it monetarily (the group charges a $10,000 talent fee) or on audience appeal."" "" Coordinating the musical tastes of students here and people in the local area isn't always easy,"" Schaberg added. When the committee decides on a group, contract negotiations are the next -- and mostlengthy -- pro cess. "" We get a contract and immediately cross out what we can't afford or provide. Then we talk,"" Schaberg said. Both Petermann and Schaberg said that many of the riAmands the bands and their road crews make are ""very specific"" and can "" border on the eccen tric."" An example Schaberg cited was the Van Halen group, which has a clause in its contract demanding the provision of two pounds of M&Ms in the dressing rooms -- with all the brown ones removed. He did not know the reason. Both committee members agreed that the best part of their job is the opportunity for an inside view photos--Charles Berul is most interesting,""  Peter-"

Committee explains process o f,
choosing concert's performers,"From COMMITTEE, page 1 Schaberg agreed with Petermann's statement in a Bucknellian interview Mon day that Southside Johnny is "" fan conscious,"" and gave this as the main reason the band was "" as easily accessible to us as it was."" Schaberg said the drawbacks of Davis Gym are many when trying to schedule a concert. "" It's not a good place to hear a concert acoustically, and it gets too hot."" Petermann said putting chairs on the floor to make the audience more com fortable reduces seating capacity by 1,000 and to make enough money to pay most bands the committee must try to sell out the 3,200 seating capacity of the gym. Southside Johnny's Tour Director, Jim Butterfield, called Davis Gym "" half a trash can,"" according to Schaberg. ""The roadies for Southside got here Friday mor ning, took one look at the place and rolled their eyes,"" he said. Other drawbacks of the gym prohibiting certain bands from playing here include the relatively small 40-foot stage and the inability of the gym's electrical system to accommodate the power of high-voltage amplifiers, Schaberg said. He said the concert committee had to borrow an extra generator from the Physical Plant to handle Southside's light show. The band had recently cancelled an ap pearance in upstate New York because the concert hall there did not have the proper electrical facilities, Schaberg said. Petermann and Schaberg said they were "" very happy"" with the performance of both Southside Johnny and his warmup act, Ellen Shipley. Southside was "" the smoothest band we've ever worked with,"" Petermann said."

Southside plays to appreciative crowd,
Performance gave Bucknellians just what they,
wanted to hear from the ever-popular group,"By DAVID O'CONNELL and ERIC HOERNER A clean-cut Southside Johnny, along with his Asbury Jukes, took the stage before a rowdy Davis Gym crowd of 2,400 Saturday night. In a busy night for Asbury Park, N.J. musi cians--Bruce Springsteen, one of Southside's best friends, launched his world-wide tour at the Univer sity of Michigan, quelling the abounding rumors that he would make an unannounced appearance at Bucknell--the group performed a wide selection of songs long popular among Southside's fans. The popularity of the group on the East Coast made the concert committee's choice nearly ideal. For all of the 90-minute show, including four en cores, most of the crowd remained on their feet clapping, singing along and even dancing. A majority of the evening's selections were from the group's third album, Hearts of Stone, including the opening number, ""I Played the Fool"" featuring an electrifying baritone sax solo by Ed Minion. The energetic and animated movements of the Miami Horns in ""I'm So Anxious"" warmed the crowd even more as the five brass players rocked, dipped and exuded pure energy, both when playing and during the rests. As in all their numbers, the Jukes put out a maximum effort to please the crowd and this number saw excellent solo work by guitarists Joel Gramolini and Billy Rush. The Jukes followed with ""Got to Get You Off M> Mind"" and ah even better showcasing of the in dividual talents of the Jukes. Rick Gazda's brassy trumpet solo was succeeded by an extraordinary show of virtuosity as two saxophones were played at once, and Richie ""La Bamba"" Rosenberg presented a powerful trombone solo. Overall the number reflected the blues style characteristic of early Southside Johnny efforts. Two songs from Hearts of Stone--""This Time Baby's Gone for Good"" and the ever-popular ""Talk to Me,"" written by Bruce Springsteen--were follow ed by ""Long Distance,"" chosen by Southside as a mellow contrast to the hard-driving ""Talk to Me."" One of only two songs from the group's latest album, Love is a Sacrifice, released in June, it is a typical Southside ballad, quite lyrical, yet in the slightly more polished style of his last two albums. Gramolini was featured again on guitar and vocals in the next number, ""Broke Down Piece of Man,"" and gave an excellent performance of a song recorded before he joined the Jukes for their fourth album. A selection from that 1979 disc, The Jukes, was next heard. This song, the energetic ""Vertigo,"" featured brass in one of the section's better per formances of the evening. ""Love on the Wrong Side of Town,"" another Spr ingsteen product, slowed the pace down by representing what Southside termed ""the only sad song of the night."" He then led the group is a showcase performance of ""Restless Heart,"" cur rently climbing the singles charts, which was the other song from the Jukes' new album. Undoubtedly, many fans wondered why the two other popular cuts from Love is a Sacrifice were not played. Both ""On the Beach"" and ""Love is a Sacrifice"" were East Coast hits all summer and would have provided a familiar sound for recent Southside converts. Springsteen's ""I Got the Fever,"" from the Jukes' first album, provided the most bluesy sounds of the evening as Southside moaned on the harmonica, a musical medium in which he is quite adept. Satur day's rendition contained more 'soul' than the early album version, mainly because of a harp solo and the mournful strains of Rosenberg's trombone. For most of the evening the guitars were over shadowed by the powerful Miami Horns, trademark of the Jukes sound, however in ""Trapped Again"" the ideal blend was achieved, providing one of the better listening experiences of the concert. After mentioning to the audience the pitiful lack of quality professional sports teams in New Jersey and a brief attempt to play the National Anthem, Southside launched into ""I Don't Want to go Home,"" the title cut from the group's debut album. Next came the song everyone had been waiting for, Bucknell's weekend alma mater, ""We're Havin' a Party."" In this, the last number of the con cert, the crowd's excitement rose to the highest pitch of the evening. Southside obliged the unabating demands of the audience with his first encore, ""All I Want is Everything,"" and with an interesting medley of Rolling Stones numbers played Southside Johnny style. A third encore featured ""La Bamba"" Rosenberg on piano and the concert's appendices ended with the title cut from Hearts of Stone. In contrast to the average untested warm-up band, Saturday's bill included RCA recording ar tists Ellen Shipley and the Numbers, a surprisingly professional East Coast act. The fetching Shipley caught the attention of the male audience with her revealing attire and won the musical respect of all with her rich vocals. The Brooklyn born-and-bred singer/composer was equally adept at red-hot, hard-driving rockers and slow ballads. Although Saturday was her first date as warm-up act for the Jukes, one would wonder why Southside didn't call Shipley on stage to sing the duet ballad ""You Mean So Much to Me."" From a student standpoint, aside from the ever bothersome Davis Gym atmosphere, Saturday's concert could not have been better. The choice o groups guaranteed the concert's success gives Bucknell's East Coast demographic composition, and as with every Southside concert, the fans were the group's main consideration. The Jukes aimed ti please and the crowd responded accordingly, mak ing Saturday's a most memorable concert."

Joni' touching,
but too preachy,"By ALLISON ABOUCHAR The movie Joni, now showing at the Campus Theater, is the touching story of a young woman fighting to put her life back together after a tragic swimming accident leaves her paralyzed from the shoulders down. Joni Eareckson, who plays herself, does an admirable job of making the audience feel the mental pain she faces. Her even tual spiritual fulfillment is the dominant message. The ending, however, resembles a crusade, which makes one wonder just how "" preachy""  the film was in tended to be. For the non- Christian, this may be a sour note in an otherwise harmonious film. Overall, the portrayal lacks realism. While the story line is good, it packs the beginnings of too many ideas into two hours without carrying enough of them through to conclusions. Joni' s ex-wrestler father (played by Bert Remsen) begins to train Steve Estes (Richard Joni Eareckson portrays herself in World Wide Pictures' new release based on her book. She shows the trauma and mental anguish she faces when trying to conquer a crippling accident. Lineback), a neighbor who works for the Earecksons, to become a stronger athlete. The audience is left dangling, though, as to whether or not Steve ever fulfills his dream of becoming "" Rocky III"" and is given instead his in- lO ira lll OICVC D 3 1 C 9 V i v i u i a i u U i a u u t o U10<<.V>>U M W  . . ."

The film, however, provides a fresh approach to personal han dicaps by delving into Joni's spiritual life and carefully molding the aspect of her physical rehabilitation around this core. Joni searches for faith and a reason to stay alive, and the movie effectively depicts her finding of these things through her commitment to Christianity. Katherine De Hetre, playing Joni's sister Jay, is compas sionate and supportive without getting syrupy, while Joni's room mates in the rehabilitation center add a comic touch to the other wise heavy film. While Joni may have technical difficulties, it is most assuredly worth seeing. It leaves an inspir ing religious message behind that may be taken to heart by Chris tian viewers or glossed over by"
Fitzwilliam Quartet,
plays final concert,By
AMY FORTGANG,"The Fitzwilliam String Quartet demonstrated once again in their concert Monday night why they are considered the foremost inter preters of Shostakovich. Each of the four pieces performed was well-interpreted and played. The Haydn, in particular, which can easily be played mechanically because of the style and time period in which it was written, was presented with a meticulous attention to depth of feeling. The most intense emotions conveyed, though, were those trans mitted by the Shostakovich String Quartet No. 8. Rooke Chapel was less full than during previous performances, and the number of professors, administration and locals was much greater than the number of students. It was a far cry from the Quartet's Sept. 14 performance, for which the hall was packed with equal numbers of students and non-students. The logical deduction made from this observation is that for the first concert there was not as much academic pressure on students as there is now; thus it was easier for students to take time away from their studies. This noticeable lack brought to the performance a chill air that has never before been present at a Fitzwilliam presentation. Part of the reason for the missing rapport between audience and performers was the lack of the usual communication between these two elements before or during the concert. Music may be the universal language, but when supplemented with a spoken word of friendship it can go so much farther. Christopher Rowland, violinist and the generally acknowledged spokesman for the group, must have sensed this same thing for--just before they began the Shostakovich--he rose to address the audience. "" For many of our concerts,""  he said, "" there is this barrier. We ar rive, dress up in these funny clothes, perform and sneak out the next day with our suitcases. We have never felt that here and that's what a relationship is all about, not having these barriers."" He thanked the people with whom the four members of the quartet were staying and Jim Hammerlee--who he called "" the ringleader of the bunch"" --before issuing an invitation to "" any of you who happen to be in England""  to stop by and see them perform in York. The group then went on to play the eighth quartet and, after the in termission, the lyrical Borodin Quartet No. 1. This quartet is a well- crafted and finely interwoven piece with delicate intricacies laced throughout that the Fitzwilliam showed to its fullest advantage. Rowland's instrument was still somewhat tinny in the upper registers and he had a little trouble keeping his strings in tune during the Borodin, but overall the concert was of the caliber that the local concert-going public has come to expect from the Quartet. No matter how it may have started out, the concert still had that special something that comes from personal contact between the audience"

Sem Gems are singing,
after two years' silence,"_ . ,, m n i r i n f r n lu m n i fiin p tin iU ! T h p  flPTTHSfi Of ' Photo-- Tim Hoying"
The Sem Gems rehearse outside the Music and Art Building. The group has,
been practicing since the beginning of the semester.,"By AMY KENNEDY The Sem Gems, female counterparts of the Bison Chips, have been reorganized after a two-year absence'. Seniors may remember a group of four girls called Four on the Floor -- or More on the Floor after the quartet expanded to eight members -- that formed in the fall of 1977. Karen Levine '81, singing lead in the new group, and Jill Stranko '81, baritone, joined together with Kristen Olsen 81, tenor, and Melissa Bodine '81, bass, to at tempt the revival of the Sem Gems. Levine and Stranko, the group's only original members, auditioned and were accepted at the time Four on the Floor became More on the Floor in the second semester of their freshman year. The name Sem Gems followed soon after and came from an old Bucknell collo quialism referring to a time when the downhill dormitories comprised a women's seminary. Sem Gems became the term commonly used to describe women living in this wall-enclosed area. The original Sem Gems consisted of eight girls who sang together, and with the Bison Chips, at Tailgate Luncheons and alumni functions. The demise of the group came in Levine and Stranko's sophomore year, when the other six members of the octet graduated. The four seniors who make up the pre sent quartet decided it would be ""fun to get the old music back together again,"" ac cording to Levine, and resurrected the Sem Gems. They will make their debut in the Homecoming Parade and will be singing all semester at University func tions. Parents' Weekend they will provide entertainment for those dining in the cafeteria. The Sem Gems have no specific plans to perform with the Bison Chips as yet, but are enthusiastic about singing with them again. There is no competition between the two groups, according to Levine, rather, they complement each other. Auditions for new members will be held in the spring so that the group will not dissolve away when the present members graduate in June. The Sem Gems hope to teach the ""proteges"" all their music and to train them in blending their voices. They are determined to keep up the tradition this time. __ _"
Art class pursues imaginative project,"If you have been accosted by a student bearing a tape-recorder and asking the question, ""What do you feel is the political unpact of art at Bucknell?"", then you are part of an innovative project undertaken by John McCluskey, lecturer in art, and 19 students in his Elements of Art class. The idea came to McCluskey as way to teach art through the ex ploration of its different media and will be brought to fruition by the time students leave for midsemester break. Each of the students is being asked to interview between six and 10 people and to record both the conversation and the length of walkway covered during it. This data will next be translated into colors and transferred onto an in terpretive map of the University the class has prepared. The resulting piece of ""art"" will serve two major purposes, McCluskey said. It will provide the campus with an interesting exhibit item in the University Center mall and it will be a basis for class discussion on the true essence of art. McCluskey hopes that the project will pro voke students to ask the question, ""What is art?"" McCluskey said art is a per sonal experience and thus the hopes harbored by some for a universal definition of art can never be realized. Art, McCluskey said, must be a revolt--and dissatisfaction and creative urge are prerequisites to creating it. Not that merely by wanting to do so one can become an artist, but the talent necessary can come from the desire to create, he said. Of course, he added, there are people who are talented yet not artists. Whether the project taken up by his class will result in a work of art or not remains to be seen. Whatever the final conclusion on that point, the students--and perhaps some of the viewers of their creation -- will be left with their own opinions on the criterion of art.- --**"

Walker touring Pa.,
with one man show,"Almost everyone on campus has watched a travelling per former arrive here, unpack his wares and props from a small bag seemingly unable to hold all that comes out of it, present his modest theatrical or acrobatic production and continue on his way. The thought of where he came from  -- or where he might go next -- and why he is doing what he is sometimes enters the mind, but it is quickly dispelled by the hectic class and social schedule. It never occurs to the casual observer at the uphill side of the University Center on a warm day when a minstrel is here that -- on another campus -- a Bucknell professor may be doing the same thing.

1980 'L'Agenda' providing,
"memories, filled with creativity","By KRIS FORSYTHE The 1980 L'Agenda, ready for distribution this weekend, is in all respects a welcomed success, pro ving that Editor Bill Lorenz '80 and his staff recovered nicely from the L'Agenda fiasco of 1979 to produce a well-organized and highly entertaining yearbook. Although the preface states that "" The 'Bucknell Experience' is difficult to capture in mere words and pictures,"" the 1980 L'Agenda goes on to do just that. Perhaps one of the nicest touches is the balance of senior and underclass photos. Unlike many yearbook candids, no one person is seen on an inordinate number of pages. There is also a good representation of both "" Greek"" and independent lifestyles, and the various shots do a good job of il lustrating the attraction of these alternatives. Another commendable aspect of the yearbook is the extensive coverage of campus events. The arts section, including Cap and Dagger productions, student-organized rock groups, Colloquy, concerts and Celebration of the Arts, receives the attention, so often missing, worthy of its importance. Likewise, the activities section includes major student organizations found on campus, usually ac companied by a brief descriptive paragraph about the individual activity. The senior section contain ing the graduation pictures and the faculty section are both well done and basically complete. These two sections are not as innovative as other sections, though their natures do not allow for much expres sion of creativity. The sports section is one of the best to appear in the L 'Agenda. Besides more-than-adequate coverage of all sporting events, including frisbee, the section includes high-quality action shots and complete team composites. Student life is another outstanding section. By interspersing events appealing to the entire cam pus, such as Greek Weekend, Homecoming '79, Halloween and January happenings, the yearbook staff provides an excellent memoir for all students, not only the graduates. There are parts geared especially toward the class of '80, such as gradua tion and the transcript of the speech made by Michael Cohen and Rob Middlebrook at the Presi dent's Dinner. In addition to its fine layout and the superb quality of the photography, the L'Agenda is often highly original in its creative impulses. A subsec tion of student life depicting various glimpses of stu dying abroad is one of these imaginative outbursts and, through illustration of familiar off-campus scenes, the class of '80--as well as those '81, '82, and '83--have a pictorial remembrance of those "" special""  places that provide often much-needed escapes from campus. The artwork throughout the book, especially the figures on the "" What's Happening""  graphic, is con sistently neat and amusing, while the color photos are extraordinarily well done--the two-page spread showing the change in seasons in the Academic Quad is stunning. The only improvements for the yearbook might be the listing of team members' names and the in clusion of hall and fratemity/sorority group shots. Aside from a few minor spelling mistakes and some white splotches on senior portraits, the book is technically flawless; excellent layout, no picture duplication, except for continuity, and no misnamed graduation pictures. 1980 L'Agenda with complete coverage, outstanding organization and high-quality photos is an excellent tribute to the class of 1980."

Jeff Payne '83 (right) and the second teamers sparked the,
Bisons to a convincing victory in the Slippery Rock Tournament,
last weekend.,
Water polo 1st in tournament,"By DAVE KIRKPATRICK ""When we control our intensity, there aren't many teams we can't beat,'' commented goaltender Tony Paxton '81, after the water polo team captured first place honors in a field of eight teams at the Slippery Rock Tournament Sunday. Bucknell raised its record to 7-1 and outscored the opposition 86-15 en route to winning the two-day tournament. ""Fast breaks were definitely the key,"" according to Mark Corl '81, to the Bisons marching unscathed through their early tournament opponents. Bucknell demolished Indiana University (Pa.) 18-1, Millersburg State, 18-4 and Cornell, 17-2. Bucknell was so dominant that their starting team played on ly the first half against each of these opponents. In the semi-finals, Bucknell never broke stride, dispatching Penn State by a convincing 19-2 final. To fuel their high scoring attack, the Bisons effec tively used a counter-attacking offense structured around the concept of the fast break in basketball which utilizes the team-speed advantage the Bisons have over many of their opponents. Scott Shulte '81 was the high scorer for the Bisons, pumping home 24 goals, while Tom Butler '82 contributed 15 goals and 19 assists and senior Mark Gensheimer tallied 11 times in the tournament. In the finals, the Bisons ran into a fired up Slip pery Rock team bent on upsetting awe-inspiring Bucknell. The first half of the title game featured tight checking by the Rock, and nervous play from the Bisons and the halftime score stood at 5-5. Gen sheimer '81 rallied the Bisons in the second half and when the spray had cleared, Bucknell had a 14-6 vic tory as well as the tourney championship. Gensheimer finished the game with six goals, while Scott Shulte '81 added three and Corl and Butler connected on two apiece. Two positive developments occurring during the weekend were the emergence of the counter-attack and the experience gained by the substitutes, senior Chris Layton, sophomores Mike Hoffman, John Simone, Jeff Payne, Dan Goss and Dave Ferguson, and freshman Scott Mutschler. All received exten sive playing time and valuable game experience. The Bisons play in the Mid-Atlantic League Tour nament at Cornell Saturday and Sunday, where they will face much of the same competition they handled with such ease last weekend. The contests count toward league standings, which eventually decide the qualifiers for the Eastern Champion ships. The Bisons' only home tournament is Oct. 17, where the competition will include the New York Athletic Club, a perennial Eastern power and rival < of the Bisons."
Gridder offense stalls in 21,
-i,
3 loss to Davidson,"The second quarter began more ominously for the Herd as Grennon's 49-yard field goal at tempt fell just a few feet short of the crossbar. Four minutes later Locey threw the first of three intercep tions he gave up during the after noon. The Wildcats then put together their only scoring drive of the first half, amassing 48 yards in eight plays. An 18-yard screen pass and 20-yard draw up the middle did most of the damage. When Jenkins was stripped of the ball by a Davidson defender on the next Herd series, the Wildcats had excellent field posi tion on their own 48-yard line. However, a Doug Smoot '82 in terception in his own endzone stopped the Wildcat drive in the closing seconds of the half and sent the Herd to the locker room with its six-point lead intact. The third quarter began slowly as neither team was able to gain a first down. Midway through the quarter, Davidson marched 55 yards in nine plays to tie the score. The point after touchdown was good and the Bisons found themselves behind by a 14-13 score. The conversion missed earlier sat heavily in the Bisons' minds. Jenkins returned the Davidson kickoff 34 yards and ""almost broke it for a touchdown,"" Curtis said. Just two plays later Locey fumbled a bad snap from center and the Wildcats recovered on the Bucknell 34-yard line. On the third play of the Wildcat series, Smoot pulled down his second interception of the after noon, by making what Curtis called ""a super defensive play."" Smoot is tied for second in the ECAC division I-AA with four in terceptions in as many games. An incredible series of ex changes followed with two Locey passes being intercepted with McKinley Norris '81 stealing one , back for the Bisons in between. The second Locey interception was a ""badly underthrown ball,"" that would have been ""a sure touchdown if it had been on the mark,"" stated Curtis. Davidson had little trouble scoring its third touchdown mid way through the fourth quarter, as they used 11 plays to drive 38 yards for the final score. The Bisons' final two drives ended in failure, indicative of an offensive performance which net ted only three first downs in the second half and 12 for the game. Overall, the Bison defense"
invades on Saturday,By STEVEN SKOLNICK and
MICHAELSUAREZ,"After the Bisons' poor per formance in losing 21-13 to David son Saturday, Head Coach Bob Curtis remarked, ""It was a pressure packed game that should have been a win for us. We didn't execute; we didn't win."" The afternoon started quite dif ferently, however, as the Herd dominated in the early going. After halting the Wildcats on their first series, the Bisons drove 55 yards in six plays for the opening score. An 18-yard touchdown pass from quarter back A1 Locey '83 to freshman split end Dave Kucera had the Bisons on the board with just 4:35 gone in the first quarter. Junior Bill Grennon's conversion was no good, a mistake which eventually became ""super critical"" ac cording to Curtis. The Wildcats were able to gain only 20 yards on their next possession and the Herd offense began their subsequent drive from their own 32. It only took eight plays for the Bisons to hit paydirt a second time. An 18-yard strike from Locey to tight end Rich Passerot- ti '82, followed two plays later by a Locey touchdown toss to Ken Jenkins '82, highlighted the drive. This time, Grennon split the posts to give the Herd a 13-0 lead."
Lafayette,"By STEVEN SKOLNICK and MICHAEL SUAREZ The Bisons return to Memorial Stadium Saturday to face Lafayette in the 58th renewal of Bucknell's oldest rivalry. The Homecoming contest kicks off at 1:30 pm. With a 1-3 record, the Leopards' offense has been struggling. All their touchdowns for the season came during their only win, a 27-20 decision over Davidson on Sept. 20. Lafayette has lost to Maine, Columbia and Central Connecticut. Head Coach Neil Putnam's charges utilize a new ly modified wing T formation on offense. Tailback Ed Rogusky and fullback Roger Curylo are the leading rushers, averaging four yards per carry apiece. Splitting the quarterbacking chores will be Mark Lenchmanck and Hal Hocking. Split end Jim Flanagan leads the receiving corps with 12 catches for 155 yards over four games. Injuries may hamper the Herd's effort to gain their third victory as starting inside linebackers Alvin Depew '81 and Pat Paro '82 will both be unavailable for action. Left tackle John Boehmer is still out, while right guard A1 Wehrhahn '81 is listed as questionable for the contest. played well, limiting the Wildcat offense, which averaged over 500 yards and 39 points per game to just 263 yards and 21 points. The Wildcats' outstanding fullback Ray Sinclair accounted for most of the Davidson offense, gaining 140 yards in 31 carries. Curtis called Sinclair ""the best back we've seen in some time."" In the final analysis, the Bison offense couldn't come through when it had to. Curtis summar ized, ""when the pressure was ap plied, we didn't have the maturi ty to put it all together."""

Penn State players receive athletic scholarships and are one of the top five squads in the country, according to Puccia. Goaltender Jean Schoenlank '84 was "" outstanding,""  Puccia said, in making 21 saves against the Nittany Lion onslaught. The Bisons again seek their first victory of the season in home contests against Franklin and Marshall Saturday and versus St. John Fisher Sunday. F&M defeated the Bisons 2-0 Sept. 27, while St. John Fisher was a na tional quarterfinalist last season."
Bear Bryant wins,

Bryant trails only Amos Alonzo Stagg, with 314 coaching trium phs, and Pop Warner, with 313. Bryant has a 35-year combined record of 300-77-16. The Crimson Tide led Kentucky only 14-0 at the half, but scored three touchdowns in a span of 2 minutes, 20 seconds in the fourth quarter to pull away. Halfback Linnie Patrick was the sparkplug in setting up touchdowns with runs of 60 and 38 yards and also scoring on a 1-yard dive. Alabama has won 25 con secutive games and is in quest of an unprecedented third straight national championship. The Crimson Tide is ranked first in both AP and UPI polls with a perfect 4-0 record.

Grieb cited Jeanne Groeneveld '83 as "" the all-around best player with her spikes and net play""  and Carolyn Weeks '82, who "" had the best game she's had yet. Her serve reception was outstan ding.""  The coach also praised captain Susan Bairstow '81, for a great serving game, as well as Katie Eckert '84, for her powerful spikes and fine net play. The Bisons defeated Lock Haven in a road match Monday, 15-6, 9-15, 15-8, 16-14. Grieb was pleased with the team's improv ed serving and serve reception, but added, "" We still do not have the killer instinct.""

NHL forecast: six top challengers,"By JEFF CROSS Though baseball is on every one's mind and football has begun, the National Hockey League begins action this week with 20 teams trying to unseat the New York Islanders as league champions. I offer my predic tions for the top teams for the up coming season. Although repeating as cham pions is always more difficult than winning the first title, the Islanders have the ingredients to capture a second Stanley Cup crown. They still have steady goaltending, a solid defense and depth at the forward positions. Dennis Potvin, Bryan Trottier and Mike Bossy are the names in the spotlight, but the rugged players like Bob Nystrom, Clark Gillies and Bob Lorimer make the Islanders tough to beat. Montreal, Stanley Cup cham pions from  1976 to 1979, is anxious to regain a position in the finals after being eliminated in the quarterfinals last year. With abundant talent at both forward and defensive positions, only in juries and suspect goaltending will prevent the Canadiens from challenging the Islanders for top laurels. Buffalo boasts the Vezina Trophy-winning goaltending duo of Don Edwards and Bob Sauve,"

The Sabres finished second in the overall points standings last year under the m agic of Scot ty Bowman as general manager. They need only more aggressive ness to make a serious run for the title. Philadelphia lost in the finals last year after winning the regular-season points race. The Flyers, who are packed with hard workers, feature a potent offense, stingy goaltending and the in spirational leadership of Bobby Clarke. Only an unsteady defen sive crew will keep the Flyers from championship contention. Boston, with new coach Gerry Cheevers, has a strong defense led by Ray Borque, last year's rookie of the year, and Brad Park. The Bruins are loaded with scrappers, but age may have caught up with Jean Ratelle and Don Marcotte, among others. The goaltending of Rogie Vachon who is attempting to regain his old form --and the untested Jim Craig will determine how high Boston finishes. Minnesota, a very young squad, was the surprise of the NHL last year by reaching the semifinals after knocking off Montreal. A potent offense and solid goaltending give the North Stars bright hope for the coming season.

Mudsharks finish 2nd to UVa,"By DAN PICARDI The men's ultimate frisbee team finished second in a field of six teams in a round-robin tour nament at Bucknell last weekend, losing only to the University of Virginia by a 15-12 decision in the finals. The Mud- sharks defeated Penn State and the Lycoming, Hershey, and Washington D.C. frisbee clubs to reach the championship. In the first contest, the Mud- sharks totally outclassed Penn State in winning 13-4. Bucknell defeated Penn State 19-5 four weeks ago. The Mudsharks' second match, against Washington D.C. was much tougher. Down 11-6 at one point the 'Sharks reeled off nine unanswered goals capitalizing on turnovers to win 15-12. Saturday's final game saw the Mudsharks demolish the Hershey frisbee club by a 26-10 verdict. Photo--Carl Jensen"

The finals against the Universi ty of Virginia, the only other undefeated team, proved to be the most exciting match of the weekend. The Mudsharks got off to a shaky start, but managed to stay close. With five minutes left in the game the 'Sharks closed to within a goal, but then their pass ing game broke down and turn overs were converted into Virginia goals, leaving the final score 15-12. "" We played well until the final game,"" said team member Peter Maier '81, adding "" overall the team worked well together.""

Hockey splits pair of games,"By JAN BALARIAN LaSalle trounced the varsity field hockey team 5-0 Saturday, just two days after the Bisons captured their second con secutive match with a 4-0 whitewash at home against Sus quehanna. LaSalle's "" exceptional per formance,""  combined with the Bisons' "" inability to move to and keep possession of the ball,"" were the deciding factors, according to coach Sally Starr. The Explorers defeated the Bisons only 3-2 last season, but "" They fired too many strong shots from too close in"" that could only have been stopped by "" miraculous saves""  on the part of goalie Betsy Doyle '82, ac cording to Starr. LaSalle jumped to a quick start, scoring after one and one half minutes had elapsed and led 4-0 by halftime. Starr remarked, "" The ease with which they scored the first goal caught our kids off balance."" Starr complimented the Bisons on their persistence, noting, "" We could easily have given up in the second half""  but, "" we got the ball a lot more on attack and had a few more scoring com ers.""  The game was actually closer than the final score indicated, as both teams are "" equally talented,"" Starr said. The loss dropped the Bisons' record to 2-4. The Bisons overwhelmed Sus quehanna Oct. 2 for their biggest victory margin of the season. Freshmen Nancy Dill and Sue Lenker, nicknamed "" The Jet Set""  by Starr because of their speed, scored the first two goals. Chrissy King '82 and Maria Pro- copio '83 tallied the the second and third goals, respectively. Starr calls King, "" The cor nerstone of our attack,""  while be ing "" the source of leadership and stability for the front line.""  Pro- copio, a substitute, "" has been playing better and better every game,""  commented Starr. The division III Crusaders ' 'worked hard to get the ball back but lacked the skill to complete their plays,"" added Stair. Starr looks for goaltender Doyle to lead the Bisons to a strong finish, stating, "" Betsy can be the spark as soon as she gets her composure back because she is mentally and physically strong."" The team can "" do well if we have mental discipline and confidence,"" she added. Bucknell hosts Lafayette Satur day at 11 a.m. and Centre Coun try Club Sunday and 11:30 a.m. The Leopards tied the Bisons 2-2 last season and sport a 2-4 record this year. The squad has not played Centre Court before this season. Starr concluded, "" If we are to think of playing any post season hockey, we must act now."""

Soccer team stumbles to,
Penn State and Rutgers,"By BOB DAVIS The soccer team dropped a pair of games this week to lower their record to 2- 3- 1. The hooters fell 3-1 to Rutgers Satur day and 5-1 to Penn State Tuesday. Penn State, ranked seventh in the na tion, played to expectations in dispatching the Bisons at State College. The Nittany Lions sport a 7-1 record, with their only loss coming against fifth-ranked Indiana. Despite good ball movement in the first half against Penn State, the Bisons faced a 4- 0 halftime deficit. Coach Craig Reynolds commented, "" Penn State worked well out side and rifled the ball across""  to constant ly threaten. Pete Jobling began the scoring for the Nittany Lions at 11:10 of the first half. blasting a shot by goaltender Pete Puccia '81. The Lions' second goal was the result of poor defensive play on the part of the Bisons, whose failure to clear the ball from the goal area allowed Lion Jeff Maierhofer to head a crossing pass behind Puccia. Dan Murphy and Steve Blumenthal tallied the remaining goals of the half for Penn State. The fifth and final Lion score came with six minutes gone in the second half off the foot of Doug Moyer. The Bisons were able to keep Penn State from any further scoring, eventually get ting on the board themselves.

to Rutgers Saturday. A pair of losses dropped the booters' record to 2-3-1.,"with 6:34 remaining, his fourth of the year, to cut the Nittany Lions' lead to 5-1. But it was simply a case of too little, too late. Still, Reynolds praised his team's effort, noting "" We moved the ball well and never gave up. I can't be unhappy about our per formance.""  Puccia commented, "" Penn State had exceptional shots and they finished their plays miraculously."" He ad ded, "" If we had played this well all season, we'd have been 5-0 up to this point."" After Saturday's 3-1 loss to Rutgers, Reynolds stated, "" We were terrible fun damentally--we made so many unforced errors. They didn't have all that much pressure on us."" The Scarlet Knights scored at 4:25 on a goal by Ramiro Borja that was actually a miskick. According to Reynolds, "" He was trying to cross it, but it sailed high into the corner."" The Bisons proceeded to play uninspired soccer for most of the remainder of the game. "" They scored early and knocked the incentive out of us,""  noted Reynolds, ad ding "" It's a weak sign if we quit after one goal."" Peter Csirmaz made the score 2-0 mid way through the first half by taking ad vantage of some Bison defensive errors to direct a header past Puccia. The Scarlet Knights picked up their third goal at 22:38 of the second half following a penalty called against Puccia, who fouled a Rutgers player after making a save. Bor ja promptly banged home the ensuing penalty shot for his second tally of the afternoon. With about 10 minutes remaining, the Knights' Roland Mitchell was ejected for throwing a punch at Brotherton, and the Bisons' only score followed shortly after wards. Freshman Peter Mullany passed to the left side where Steve Goldenring '83 controlled the ball and volleyed it in from 11 yards out. "" We were down 3-0 and that's when we started to play,""  said Reynolds. "" I had good vibes going in, but you're going to have your off days.""

Students battle with,
Coder over fund use,
ABS petitions University on fund control,
Committee proposes writing program;,
75% o f students deficient in skills,"By JEFF CROSSLAND A proposal calling for major revisions in the teaching of writing at the University has been sent to department chairmen by a subcommittee of the University Committee on Instruction. The 16-page writing program proposal says all students in both the College of Arts and Sciences and the College of Engineering should be required to take three courses in writing before graduating. A basic writing course and a writing emphasis course would be required of students in the freshman and sophomore year, and an advanced course -  probably related to the major -  would be required in either the junior or senior year. A principal change that would result if the pro gram proposal is ever passed by the full faculty would be that the responsibility for the teaching of writing would no longer be placed solely on the English department's freshman course offerings. The subcommittee report said all departments should offer courses with an emphasis on writing. There are reasons for concern about the writing ability of students here. According to the sub committee's report, "" some students cannot use the medium of language effectively in its written form. "" Three areas of evidence suggest that significant numbers of students lack the appropriate writing skills- the University admissions profile, the number of entering students requiring special tutorial assistance, and faculty opinion,""  the report Two surveys, one conducted in November and the other in February, asked faculty members "" How adequate are the writing skills of your students. The faculty response for freshmen and sophomores indicated "" about 25 percent are accomplished for most purposes. Maybe another 50 percent are more See WRITING, page 5 By S.A. HABETZ The Association of Bucknell Students has voted to petition the University Committee on Com plimentary Activities to deter mine who has legitimate control of funds generated by the Bucknell Recycling Club. Bob Doms '81, President of the recycling club, proposed the peti tion before the ABS Congress Monday night. The approved statement reads: "" the ABS petitions the University Committee on Complimentary Activities to review the policy concerning the Recycling Group's funds and the future use of those funds and determine who has legitimate control of the funds generated by the Bucknell Recycling Group. These funds, totaling $4,633, are currently under the control of Professor Charles Coder, the group's ex advisor."" Professor of Engineering Charles Coder has retained con trol >f the Recycling Club's bank account although he has resigned as the group's advisor. Coder said the original intent of the Recycling Club was to use the money for a scholarship fund for area high school students. Doms said it was Coder's "" original intention to use the money for a scholarship fund, not the Hub's."" 'The club's intentions,""  ac cording to Doms, "" were, and are, to expand the program, using funds to buy equipment and materials deemed necessary and beneficial for the program and to pledge money to support the pro duction of the Bucknell En vironmental News."" "" The third and lowest priori ty,""  Doms said, "" was listed as scholarship and/or other alter natives."" Dunlop said last week that the ABS could petition for a "" review of policy,""  for the Recycling Club. The review, he said, would determine whether the present members of the club are allowed to control its funds. "" We would rather not engage in a review,""  Dunlop said then. "" We're not sure what kind of ef fect that will have on other clubs."" . . The petition was originally directed to Dean of Student Af fairs John Dunlop and Vice Presi dent of Administration and Finance John Zeller. Dunlop, who also serves as ABS advisor, ob jected to this. "" Such a precedent could lead to the administration having to serve as mediator in the internal difficulties of all stu dent groups at Bucknell,""  he said. The ABS Congress agreed with Dunlop's concern -"
Prison's NAACP is disciplined,
CLIFFORD KINNEY,"By LYNNE RUTHERFORD Prison authorities have denied the Lewisburg Federal Prison's inmate chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People access to out side association members for six months. The chapter's inmate members may hold meetings among themselves during that time, however. The Sept. 8 action of Warden J. Petrovsky has resulted in a series of repercussions from the Lewisburg Prison Project and the Bureau of Prisons in Washington. The Lewisburg branch was founded eight years ago as the first prison based N.A.A.C.P. chapter in the nation. The action was taken because the N.A.A.C.P. was interfering with and setting goals for the chapter, and refusing to let the in- mates "" do their own thing,""  ac cording to Clifford Kinney, ex ecutive assistant to the warden. Prison officials have refused to cite specific incidents of N.A.A.C.P. interference. Outside interference with an in mate group is in violation of the prison's policy that all inmate groups be self-governing. L e r o y  M o b le y , national director of the N.A.A.C.P. prison program, said the charges were "" ludicrous""  and had "" no basis in fact."" Neither Petrovsky nor the in mate president of the chapter could be reached for comment. Mobley charged that the restriction was arbitrary and discriminatory, and that prison officials are unsympathetic to the needs of black inmates. The See NAACP, page 4"

Student food thief strikes mods;,
University is4to solve problem',"By MATT KARANIAN The student responsible for a recent rash of food thefts from the Bucknell West mods has been iden tified, according to Vice President for Administra tion and Finance John Zeller. Zeller said he would not reveal the name of the student responsible, but said the University is work ing "" to solve the problem."" In recent weeks, thefts of food items have oc curred repeatedly in the mods, according to John Dzurinko '81, a resident of the solar mod. According to a complaint filed with campus security and with East Buffalo township police by Kimbra Swigart '81, "" unknown person or persons did remove 2 boxes of cereal and one half gallon of milk""  from her kitchen In mod 23 between midnight and 9 a.m. Sept. 5. Swigart reported she locked both doors of the mod before going to bed, and said she awoke the next morning to find one door open, and the food missing from the kitchen. Keith Rozolis '81 filed a similar complaint less than one week later. He complained in a report to campus security and to East Buffalo police that "" unknown person or persons removed cookies, assorted cheeses, apple crumb cake, fudge cookies, and sliced ham"" from his mod 6 kitchen between 12:30 and 1:30 a.m. on Sept. 11. According to Assistant Dean of Student Affairs Joseph Mammola, these are the only recorded in stances of food thefts at Bucknell West this se mester. Mammola was not aware that Zeller had identified the person responsible for the thefts. Mammola said he had no leads or suspects in the case. He said, however, the person might be a "" bold and domineering""  type. Dzurinko said there were several other incidents, but they have not been reported to police. Zeller refused to speculate upon any motives a student might have for stealing food from student kitchens. He refused to identify the student or ex plain what, if any, action will be taken against the person. The physical plant is In the process of changing locks on doors in the mods now, but Zeller "" couldn't say"" when he expected the work to be completed. "" It may take a little time,"" he said, refusing to speculate on a date. Photo--Megan Young"

CAREER DEVELOPMENT WEEK--Students examine graduate,
study programs with a representative of Rutgers Univer,
"sity Wednesday. Career Development Week, conducted",
"under the auspices of the Office of Career Services, ran",
from Wednesday to Friday. Programs included mock inter,
views and discussions with representatives from corpora,
tions and graduate schools.,
Campus leaders convene for meeting;,
students urged to honor recess dates,"ABS President John Dzurinko '81 expressed con cern at Wednesday's roundtable discussion that students will disregard the dates of midsemester break and either leave school early or return late. "" The midsemester break is experimental, and professors will be checking attendance,"" Dzurinko said. The other student leaders should publicize -- through their organizations -- the importance of class attendance up to Oct. 24 and prompt return at 8 a.m. Oct. 29, he said. Dzurinko said students should keep in mind that the break was instituted to "" rectify the severe shortcomings of the fall semester calendar"" and as such should be respected. The meeting was the third of student organization leaders, who began a series of discussions at Dzurinko's urging to coordinate their groups ahd plan activities. The meetings are held weekly dur ing dinner in the Concern and Action office. Present at this week's meeting were Dzurinko, WVBU-FM Program Director Jay Cresswell '81, Bucknell Engineer Editor David Christiansen '81, Concern and Action President Steven Kushner '82, Women's Concern Group Chairperson Lynne Rutherford '82 and Christian Fellowship President Keith Brown '81. Dzurinko again expressed what he saw as a "" need"" for campus leaders to receive course credit for their work. He said student leaders should find a sponsor within individual departments, namely English credit for Bucknellian section editors and sociology credit for Concern and Action organizers. The ABS president also suggested that the leader^ consult with members of their organizations and submit ideas on new, "" socially oriented courses and seminars""  to be added to the University catalogue: Such courses and seminars would serve to draw the student body and Lewisburg closer together, he said. The ABS has already begun one such program in its sponsorship of student attendance during local town meetings. The success of Christy's Gate was noted, with Concern and Action President Kushner reporting that the next appearance of the cafe will be in early November. A further non-alcoholic alternative was proposed in the form of a dance in the Bison, to be scheduled following the break. Dzurinko expressed sympathy for the Women's Concern Group's petition protesting the lack of a female gynecologist on campus first semester. The petition is being circulated now and will be submit ted to John Dunlop, Dean of Student Affairs, in the near future. During the next few weeks the student leaders will address ABS meetings on the topic of student activities. As poor attendance marked the meeting, the fitting topic of their talks will be the difficulties of organizing student groups under the pressure of academics."
Teamsters struggle for support; to hold meeting soon,"By MATT KARANIAN The Teamsters will sponsor an organiza tional meeting for non-professional employees here "" in the near future"" to , solicit support for its unionization efforts, according to Alfred Byrd, secretary- treasurer and business representative of the local. Byrd hopes non-professional employees in his target group of Physical Plant and dining service workers will support the Teamsters as their collective bargaining agent. He said there are "" a lot of people in terested"" in unionizing, but he refused to cite specific numbers. Some employees have signed cards pledging support of the Teamsters, Byrd said, but he would not say how many cards he received, either. He said he does not want the University to find out. If one-third of the employees in the pro1 posed target group for the union sign the pledge cards, the Teamsters will be allow ed to put the unionization issue up to elec tion. The American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) has also been seeking to unionize the same group of i>>on- professionals here. William Fogle, staff representative for AFSCME, said he is not making any ef forts to unionize the Physical Plant and dining service workers now, however. "" The interest isn't that great. It's just a trickle,""  Fogle said. AFSCME had been working to gain the support of employees here since 1978. Fogle successfully peti tioned the National Labor Relations Board for permission to hold an election on the issue, but AFSCME lost in the referendum. Non-professionals voted 3-1 against en dorsing AFSCME as their collective bargaining agent in April 1979. Despite Fogle's failure to draw support for AFSCME, Byrd does not think the Teamster's efforts here will be "" necessari ly futile.""  Byrd said the Teamsters have organized "" many times where others have tried and failed."" Citing Teamster successes with organiz ing employees at Penn State University and at the University of Pennsylvania, Byrd said there is "" always a possibility"" for organization. "" Some employees don't think they've had fair cost of living increases. We are not the judge and jury of whether people are getting enough (wages and benefits). We just try to help them get what they want,""  Byrd said. The Teamsters and AFSCME are separate and distinct unions, and their ac tions to organize non-protessionals are not coordinated. Byrd said he did not know if AFSCME was "" even trying or not.""  He said any actions AFSCME takes would not influence the Teamsters. Fogle said, however, that actions the Team sters take would influence AFSCME's efforts. "" I'm just waiting to see what the Teamsters come up with,"" he said. "" If they petition for an election, I'm going to try to get on the ballot."" Although employee cards pledging sup port of the union are required from one- third of the employees in a target group in order to force an election, a collective bargaining agent needs to collect pledge cards from only 3 percent of the members in the target group to get its name added to the ballot, Fogle said. Fogle expects to have pledge cards from 3 percent of the non-professionals in the target group."

Prison's N AACP activity restricted,"From NAACP, page 1 Lewisburg Prison is comprised of 70 percent racial minorities. Petrovsky first informed the N.A.A.C.P. of his decision to restrict visitors in a Sept. 8 letter to Connie Craig, the association's Pennsylvania state coordinator of prison programs. Craig then informed the New York based N.A.A.C.P. office, which telegrammed back a re quest for an emergency meeting with prison and N.A.A.C.P. of ficials, as well as some Penn sylvania state senators and local congressmen. Petrovsky denied this request, and Mobley said he will take the matter to the Bureau of Prisons in Washington for review. Mobley founded the first N.A.A.C.P. chapter in 1972 when he was an inmate in Lewisburg. It now numbers over 250 mem bers and has served as a role model for 400 other prison chapters across the country. Mobley cited his status as an ex inmate as another possible reason for being denied access to the chapter."

"" The LPP is precently working in concert with the national office of the N.A.A.C.P. If they ask us to do something, we'll do it. We are supportive of them in every respect,""  according to Toni Byrd, executive director of the LPP. The prison project is a non-profit organization which was founded seven years ago to safeguard inmate's rights. "" The prison officials were getting worried that the chapter was gaining too much support from inmates and fostering brotherhood among them. The restrictions were made for security reasons,""  Byrd said. "" This is another example of prison officials trying to cut in mate's off from the outside world,""  Byrd said. Both Mobley and the LPP pledged to keep trying to rein"

Writing proposal made,
by University Committee,"From WRITING, page 1 or less incompetent --some inadequacies. About 15 percent have more serious problems and some 10 percent qualify as essen tially illiterate.""  The report said the proposals offered should be instituted on an experimental basis for the next two years. The six-member subcommittee, chaired by Assistant Professor of English Catherine Smith, releas ed the report to the faculty for consideration Sept. 10 after a series of sessions this summer to draft the proposal. A program for the CQjnprehen- siye revision and improvement the teaching of writing -- and the improvement of writing skills by students here -- was first submit ted to the full Instruction Com mittee by Smith in March. After reviewing the Smith proposal for two months, the Instruction Com mittee created the subcommittee -- with Smith as chairman -- "" to explore possibilities of expanded writing instruction at Bucknell and to develop models for te a c h in g  m o d e ls in the disciplines."" No consensus could be reached on the original Smith proposal by the full committee, although the group unanimously agreed that revision in the University's pre sent writing program was need ed, according to the committee's published minutes. The committee also feared the original proposal would not pass the vote of the full faculty, the minutes said. While faculty participation in offering these courses would be voluntary, the report said that in terested faculty should be helped to institute the writing program through the establishment of workshops in the teaching of writing. Each department chairman is expected to solicit opinions from department members within the next week. Provost Wendell Smith will hold a meeting with chairmen Thursday to discuss the proposal. Catherine Smith called this meeting a forum for suggestion, criticism and "" equal exchange."" Complete and detailed reactions from faculty members are to be forwarded to the subcommittee for final review by the second week of November. Smith said she has "" no idea what the faculty's response will be,"" and won't know until this point. The Committee on Instruction and the writing subcommittee will then revise the program ac cordingly, though the chairman said she has no desire to present a "" watered down""  proposal to the full faculty. She said the final program will probably be voted on at the facul- ty ' s monthly meeting in December. In addition to Catherine Smith, the others on the subcommittee are Assistant Professor of Chemical Engineering Michael Hanyak, Professor of Chemistry William Scouten, Assistant Pro fessor of Philosophy Frank Wilson, Associate Professor of English Philip Withim and Teresa Twomey'81. The proposal now outlines what it calls a lower division require ment and an upper division re quirement for writing courses. The two types of writing courses in the lower division are designated W1 and W2. The pro posal describes a Wl course as one "" designed to teach fun damental techniques of writing."" A W2 course is a "" writing em phasis course"" that is "" designed to teach writing in accompani ment to other study."" The upper division requires that "" an advanced course emphasiz ing writing must be taken by all students during their last four semesters.""  Furthermore, the proposal suggests this require ment should be met "" in the stu dent's area of concentration or major."" The proposal designates this type of course W3, and describes it as an "" advanced writing emphasis course."" The proposal also provides for the teaching of writing tutorials. It states "" students may at any time be required to take remedial tutorials."" This tutorial require-"

CATHERINE SMITH,"ment may become necessary under three basic kinds of situa tions. First, a student entering Bucknell may show deficient writing skills in some of the areas of what the proposal calls "" entry assessments""  -- essays written as part of the application, secon dary school records, scores on verbal aptitude tests and "" a sample essay written under uniform conditions at the Univer sity before the first semester."" Second, a student may fail to <<complete a Wl or W2 course satisfactorily. Third, a student may be recom mended for a tutorial by a dean, advisor or instructor. The proposal explains further that "" courses designated Wl, W2 and W3 might be newly developed, or they may be adapted from existing offerings."" The Departments of English, political science, chemistry and the College of Engineering now offer courses similar to the ones proposed. Along with teaching tutorials and Wl, W2 and W3 courses, the writing program would be ad ministered by a coordinating body known as the Composition Council. The council would be composed of "" six members drawn from across the Universi ty""  with a chairman to be elected from among the members of the council."
Polls show voters are,
tired of campaign,"By DAVID O'CONNELL As the presidential campaigns ended their seventh week, voter polls showed an increasingly negative view towards the partisan at tacks exchanged between President Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan. Although Reagan clings to a modest lead--43 percent to 35 percent for Carter with 10 percent for Rep. John B. Anderson--many voters said in an Associated Press-NBC news poll last week that they are becoming "" increasingly dissatisfied"" with all of the alternative can didates. Nearly 40 percent of the potential voters said that Carter's cam paign had been mean-spirited and vicious, and almost 50 percent said he did not deserve re-election. Carter's harshest criticism of his Republican opponent came in Chicago Monday when he said that a victory for himself would bring national unity while a victory for Reagan could mean that "" Americans might be separated, blacks from whites, Jews from Christians, North from South, rural from urban."""
CAM PAIGN UPDATE,"Also this week, Carter declared that his programs would lead to an "" economic renaissance,"" and spoke of his record of reducing oil im ports and creating jobs. Reagan's response to the President's attacks was more mild than his previous speeches. "" I can't be angry,"" he said, "" but I think Carter owes the country an apology."" The Republican candidate said Tuesday that if elected he would name a woman to fill "" among the first Supreme Court vacancies in my administration."" Strongly defending his position on equal op portunities for women, Reagan attempted to appeal to women, who--according to the polls--are not supporting him as much as the * male population is. In a rally for college students in Claremont, California, Monday, Reagan was heckled "" Heil, Reagan"" salutes and the crowd chanted, slogans about his stance on air pollution in the smog-choked area. He responded by saying that "" if it wasn't for our generation they'd be say ing 'Heil somebody' today."" Anderson's campaign as an independent lost some ground in the polls, and fund raising problems led him to seek more support from past contributors. However, the formation of a committee of celebrities endorsing Anderson -- including actor Paul Newman and writer Kurt Vonnegut -- was announced in New York Monday. Anderson predicted last Sunday that a surge of backing for his candidacy would occur in the next three weeks which would give him a chance at winning the election."

The CCCO calls itself the ""na tion's largest draft counseling agency."" Spears said the summer draft registration of men born in 1960 and 1961 was ""just the first step toward returning to the draft."" He said the U.S. has ""never had a registration without a draft, and rarely a draft without a war."" CCCO has sued Selective Ser vice for their draft plans and learned the Selective Service plans to allow registrants to claim hardship, medical and conscientious objector status ""only at the last possible moment after induction orders are issued,"" according to Spears. Spears said ""unless students begin to think about, and collect evidence for conscientious objec tion claims and other options, they are certain to be caught un prepared."" There is no longer a college stu dent deferment under the new draft laws. CCCO was founded in 1948 and is a national, non-profit agency counseling young Americans fac ing the prospect of military ser vice, or those already in the military."

Zeller said these "" single issue proponents""  acted in conflict with the "" very principles they en dorse"" by defacing the buildings. Whitaker said the messages were written not by "" anti- nukers,"" but rather by "" some of the guys from the house."" He said they were "" not acting under the authority of the social chair man."" It was "" not a good idea"" and he would "" not have sug gested it,"" the KDR president said. However, the writing was "" probably effective,"" Whitaker said. "" I would assume that it gets more exposure than the posters, especially for those people who only go to the U.C. once a day. It supplements the posters."" Whitaker said "" like commer cials or advertisements, the more the names are drilled in, the more likely you are to buy the product,""  or in this case, attend the party. Whitaker said he doesn't ex pect this method of advertising for parties to recur. Lynn Jenkins '82, president of the Students for Environmental Awareness -  a group opposed to nuclear energy -- said "" the anti nuke supporters did not write on the walls,"" and said Zeller's charges were not currect. Jenkins said "" obviously someone who feels as strongly about the environment would not do something like that."" There are "" clearly regulations which prohibit writing or putting signs on the walls of the buildings,"" according to Zeller. Zeller said he was "" sorry to have maligned"" the anti-nuclear groups with the charge in his let ter. He said the graffiti he saw, however, made "" no mention of a party."""

A,"^ Mika hlem. but the men will eventually posts of the two patrolme By MARC ELLIOTT Vacancies in the security force here have yet to be filled, forcing officers on the force to work as much as 14 hours overtime each week, according to Campus Security Chief Norman Fine. The vacancies on the force resulted when Vice President for Administration and Finance John Zeller fired patrolmen Charles Gross and Ralph Strunk "" for cause"" Sept. 19. Zeller has con- sistently refused to comment fur ther on his reasons for discharg ing the two campus patrolmen. Fine said he does not "" see any immediate difficulties""  resulting from the vacancies on his force. Fine said the force is "" providing adequate coverage."" Because of the dismissal of the two officers, the four patrolmen remaining on the force each work an average of 14 extra hours weekly in overtime, Fine said. Assistant Chief of Security Mike Amarante and Fine have assum- *ed shifts in the patrol rotation to help fill the shortage, he said. Find said "" so far it's no pro blem, but the men will eventually get tired"" of working overtime. Zeller expects it to be at least "" several more weeks"" before replacements are hired to fill the posts of the two patrolmen discharged. The University is currently in terviewing 80 applicants for the posts."

Romper Room rejects?,
We've all heard the reports that the nation's high schools are,
graduating an alarming number of illiterates. But we know that to,
attend a college like Bucknell--Barron's College Catalogue says we,
"are ""highly competitive,"" if that matters--you can't be a member of",
that select group of Romper Room rejects.,
That's probably why a faculty survey rates only 10 percent of the,
students here as illiterate.,
"Wait a minute, let's hear that again.",
"Yes, it's true. The survey also reports professors rate about 50",
"percent of their students ""more or less competent"" ; another 15 per",
"cent are said to have ""serious problems."" Advanced calculus is un",
necessary to determine that this leaves a mere 25 percent of the stu,
dent body receiving faculty approval.,
A subcommittee of the University Committee on Instruction has,
proposed that students be required to take three writing courses at,
"beginning, intermediate and advanced levels.",
100 level English composition courses are virtually the only of,
ferings the University has for writing improvement. The English,
Department and the tutor are overburdened. We strongly endorse,
this proposal and insist the University make immediate plans to put,
these measures into practice. The results of the faculty survey are,
"most disturbing. A $7,000 yearly tuition fee leaves no room for com",
"placency concerning the ability to write, intrinsic to everyone's",
education.,
Warning a week away,
"The mid-semester break, the seeds for which were planted",
"proudly in this column almost two years ago to the day, will blossom",
in a week for the first time.,
"After a period of nurture through the ABS Congress, the Univer",
"sity Committee on Instruction, the calendaring office and the full",
"faculty, the four day respite from an otherwise grueling 12-week",
regimen is here for the benefit of all. But--and we cannot emphasize,
this fact or warn people of it enough--the break has a one-year con,
tract only.,
The faculty can and very likely will cancel that contract and,
take the break away next year if too many of us leave before our last,
academic commitments Friday and arrive after our classes have,
begun again Wednesday morning. If you read this page you have,
heard that line before; if you think we are trying to drum it into you,
"through repetition, you're right.",
"There are just so many ways to say it, but this appears to be the",
most straightforward: Stick around now and you will benefit later.,
Advancing the arts,
"Julius Bloom, in his report on cultural events at Bucknell, unwit",
tingly hit upon one of the issues that has long been holding the,
"University back artistically. He proposed the formation of a ""new",
"entity on campus"" to serve as overall coordinator for all the arts",
organizations now in existence.,
What Bloom did not know is that such an organization does exist.,
Most students don't know about the Association for the Arts at,
"Bucknell, either, which is the significant fault of the group. The",
association stands as an example of a group with good intentions,
that lacks the knowledge and expertise to work these hopes into,
tangible and effective realities.,
"Bloom's report says the ""new entity"" should be ""headed by a",
qualified person who gives his of her principal time to the assign,
"ment."" It seems logical that -- in setting up a truly professional arts",
association -- those in charge would want at the helm a person with,
training in the field of arts management who could devote full atten,
tion to the running of such an organization.,
If the University honestly wants to advance the artistic at,
"mosphere on campus, the first step is the appointment of such a per",
son to take charge of and reshape the Association for the Arts.,

Recycling Group president explains controversy,">> * 1 * r ___ <<iw MA/nr/ilitwt rtrAim nrocirlontc mir nnoratifinS. Fur fi To the Editor: As president of the Bucknell Recycling Group, I feel com pelled to make further comment on the controversy concerning the control of recycling group funds. In the spring of last year, Professor Coder and the group had several disagreements con cerning club policy. Members of the group sup ported the expansion of recycling efforts on campus as well as in the community. Coder did not. Members of the group were en thusiastic in our financial support of Bucknell Environmental News. Coder was not. T h e s e d i s a g r e e m e n t s precipitated Coder's resignation as the group's advisor. However, Coder did not relinquish his con trol of the group's bank account, which contains about $4,600. Coder feels that by doing so, he will be protecting the interests of past students who recycled in the belief that the money earned from their activities would go in to a trust fund, the interest from which would provide a scholar ship for a local high school stu dent. The current leadership of the recycling group feels that Coder is mistaken, and that control of the account should revert to the recycling group. To resolve this issue, the recycling group has asked the ABS to petition the ad ministration for a review of policy. This review has been granted, and will be carried out by the Committee on Com plementary Activities. To support our case, we have contacted all but one of the past six recycling group presidents, all of whom agree that the funds in the account should be used to expand, and make more efficient, the recycling effort at Bucknell. It is rather obvious that $4,600 dollars could go a long way toward improving our facilities. I would also like to respond to our critics that the recycling group does a tremendous job for an all-volunteer student organization. I doubt if many peo ple fully realize the magnitude of our operations. For example, last semester the group recycled more than 115,000 lbs. of paper. More than 70,000 lbs. of paper have been recycled in the first month and a half of this semester alone. Bucknell is fortunate to have enough concerned students to make this worthy effort possi ble. Bob Doms '81 President, Bucknell Recycling Group"
Actions speak louder,
than words on any wall,"TOtiejoin with John Zeller in regretting the fact that some nameless individual(s) recently felt it necessary or justifiable to express themselves on the pillars of Marts and Coleman Halls. However, I feel that a distinction must be made between the truly "" well-intentioned and highly moral"" anti-nuclear proponents and the person(s) who think that defacing property with anti-nuke slogans is the best or only means of expressing their active con cern; that is, if they are concerned at all. I believe that the former are, according to principle, inherently concerned with protecting the aesthetics of the environment, while the latter seem not to be. For these individuals, the popularity of the "" No Nukes"" cry seems to have obscured the very reasons behind it, rendering it almost meaningless. I ask you to recognize the essential difference bet ween these two groups, and not to place blame unjustifiably on the wrong persons. To the former group, more thanks for joining in the rally at Berwick and for your continuing support of the environmental mdeg  And to the latter, whoever you may be, a request that you think twice before engaging in irresponsible actions that might tarnish the work of those who are not simply voicing, but also acting upon their beliefs. Actions do speak louder than words on any wall"

"President, Students for Environmental Awareness",
Former recycling president's view,"To the Editor : The conflict over the use of Recycling Group pro fits has been recognized by each of the past presidents of the group. A silent dissension from Professor Coder's hope of a scholarship fund was the rule. The long-range goal envisioned by both the presidents and the consensus of the group centered on continuing and expanding the recycling effort at Bucknell and possibly in Lewisburg. Three presidents managed the Recycling Group prior to the spring of 1976. All were still active in the group in the years 1975-76. That spring David Ander- spn '77 handed the presidency over to me. Discus sions In Recycling Group meetings with those past presidents -- all at once or in separate meetings -- conveyed the intention of using the group's profits for maintenance and expansion of recycling efforts. Each of the three prior presidents described to me their hope, which was also the consensus of the group, of using the funds in this way. Vocal approaches to Coder on the matter were avoided, primarily out of respect for his extensive help in the operations of the group. Coder acted as the link with the paper buyer in Williamsport, often cut corners for the group with the Physical Plant, and had his secretary keep the financial records. At one time between spring, 1976, and spring, 1978 during my presidency, the group again faced the problem of listing priorities for the use of their pro fits. A proposal for a fund of $500 for scholarship was made and approved by the group. $100 was to be allocated for five consecutive years. All other monies were to be used for recycling purposes. Although follow-through did not reach the Office of Financial Aid, Coder should have received notice of this decision. I do not know of the policies set by any charter nor the initial agreement with the administration and Coder. I do know, however, that each of the presidents, beginning with Doug Bastion '76 and through myself, has expressed the desire to spend the major portion of the group's profits for recycl ing efforts, and not on a scholarship fund. 6 Merlin Slyter"

Demands direct dialing,"To the Editor I find most amusing the oc currence of two separate but related incidents within the last few weeks. The first is a report of the faulty pay phone system on campus, resulting in a substan tial bill to be footed by the University. It seem s that students were able to place long distance calls from pay phones without the operator requesting any deposit of coins. According to the freshman class president, the problem has been rectified: all tolls are to be paid by the University, i.e., the student body. The second is the article in the September 19, 1980 issue of the Bucknellian concerning a new phone system for the University. What amuses me is that this is the third such article the fftu>>knriHan has run in the four years I have been here. The latest one reports how Gerry Commer- ford indicated that for the first time, tiie University has fixed a target date for completion of said system (August, 1981). I was quite perplexed by reading this, especially when, upon a little research,"
I,"discovered that in the April 7, 1978 Buckpellian, the University was to have its new phone system by September 1980 (last month). Again, the September 14, 1979 issue of the Bucknellian promised a new system in the "" fall of 1980."" These two incidents, together, should be a caveat to both students and administration. To the students: while we may have been promised such a useful and needed revised phone system, we have indeed been led on and somewhat prostituted in the past, so don't get your hopes up. To the Administration: whether you were ever aware of it, there has been and always will be a demand for a phone system that allows for the placing of direct long distance calls. It is high time you quit the deceptions and act on that with which you seem so effusive with words. BobPollokoff'81 To the Editor: Given the general aura of frivolity that normally surrounds Homecoming, I was pleased and gratified to see that the brothers of SAM chose to use the occasion of their participation in the parade to extoll the old-fashioned virtue of discipline.

An alternative: endorse Frank Wilson for president,"By RICHARD BROCKHAUS Around campus I hear ominous rumblings from honest and in telligent people about not voting fo r  J im m y C a rte r co m e November. Some of the ramblers intend, so I gather, to vote for Ronald Reagan, although"
I,"honestly don't know why; no one has yet presented me with a plausible example of a positive attribute possessed by the former Governor of California. But if one has a hankering to elect a senile fascist as Presi dent, I doubt highly that anything that I might say here would scratch that itch. More troubling, however, are those who ap parently intend to vote for John Anderson, but I think that I can offer good reasons for not choos ing that course of action. Let me begin with an historical anecdote. Once, long ago and far away, when the world was much dif ferent than it is now, a fat, in telligent and reasonably honest fuddy-duddy named Hubert Horatio Humphrey was running for president against a dangerous paranoid named Richard Milhous Nixon. Hubert, for reasons not clear, decided to follow LBJ in his self-destructive support of what Mr. Reagan tells us was a noble crusade in southeast Asia to either rid the world of Com munists or, failing that, rid it of gooks in general. Many of us, including your nar rator, said, as November 1968 ap proached, "" Humphrey, Nixon . . .  what's the difference?""  and so voted for Eldridge Cleaver or Moose Skowron or M ickey Mouse, or whatever. (Others of us, whose political consciousness had been raised to a somewhat higher level, voted for RMN, on the grounds that this might prod the inexorable dialectic of history toward its final conclusion -- remember, folks, this was long ago, when p olitics m eant that Anderson has even the remotest chance of winning. So if you are an Anderson Optimist, you can stop reading here. Second, a vote for Anderson is a vote for Reagan. The polls clear ly show that Anderson draws most of his strength from tradi tional D em ocratic support."

leu/isbupg,"sometnmg more tnan whether we act polite to black people or not The difference between Hubert and Tricky Dick became clear to us with tragic quickness, and I here refer not so much to the Watergate follies as to the more lasting fruits of the Nixon presidency: the devastation of Cambodia, the packing of the Supreme Court with mediocres, and the loss of faith among Americans in the notion of social progress. Now, can we learn something from this saga of the ancient past? First, 1 am here assuming that no one in their right mind thinks (Query: why does Anderson spend most of his time attacking Carter, anyway? Reagan's posi tions ought to seem more heinous to him.) Third, the spectre of a Reagan presidency is so frightening that we ought try anything to avoid it. In all sincerity, I would vote for Richard Nixon were he the only alternative to Reagan. Many Anderson supporters argue that one ought to vote for the best man. This, 1 think, is ab surd. One ought to vote to have the best president, and this means voting for someone who at least has a chance of winning. If one is not interested in who can win, and wants to vote for the best man they can find, it is cer tainly the case that there are bet ter people around than Anderson. My personal suggestion is tnat you vote for Frank Wilson. Although I am not certain that Frank is the best, I am certain that he is far more intelligent, honest and capable than John Anderson. I think that this is a crucial election, very crucial indeed. I am honestly frightened by the flood of jingoistic sword-waving rhetoric spouted by both real can didates, and I honestly find Carter a less than thrilling can didate. But I also think that any in telligent and honest person who (unlike the New York Liberal Party) contains the urge to be self-indulgent with his or her vote, will be forced to conclude that even if a vote for Carter means four more years of in competence, then that represents a small price to pay to keep Disneyland out of Washington.

As a matter of fact, Bucknell reminds me of a golf course. We have the players, and we have the caddies, and each know their job. There are many, many foursomes at Bucknell, and if you're willing to play by the rules you can join a foursome too. Of course, if you don't want to play by the rules you have to putt by yourself. But there's always the possibility that if you weren't born to play you might just make a great caddie. The only problem to all this is that those who play by them selves sometimes get in the way. But after all, hopefully after Bucknell we will all belong to "" real"" golf courses like our dads and have plenty of "" greens"" to ourselves. The "" pros""  at Bucknell are in credible also. They care very much that we all perfect our games. Although it is tough at times, if we all conform to the proper stance, keep our heads down and grip as we're told, after four years we'll really know-how to play the game. It's really great how the "" pros""  give us so much instruction and we don't even have to talk to one another. Well, I think it's about time to go out and spank some Spaldings (and maybe a few of those lonesome puttsters too, ha, ha). It's about time this place was cleared of those who don't want to play along with everyone else. If you want to come along maybe we could nudge a few of those sluggards off the course with our cart.

The typical suburban family may become extinct,"* **- . . . . . . i i ___ _ i. _ I __ i _____ _ _______ v t . 1 1 . f r t mncaiim Hienlov By TODD 6. BUCHHOLZ One of the more saddening car toons I've seen depicts the extinc tion of the suburban family. In a museum are stuffed versions of Johnny and his baseball bat, his sister in pigtails, his mother with Tupperware and his father holding a briefcase. This Parents' Weekend, it seems appropriate to consider the fate of suburbia and the post- World War II dream of owning a home and raising kids in a safe and serene neighborhood. Quite a bit of evidence points away from the lifestyle so many of us grew up with. The economic situation forbids young couples from purchasing new homes. In terest rates for mortgages and labor costs for construction are extremely high. Even the local school system, the foundation of suburban com munities, is floundering. More and more districts have become regionalized. State boards of education are usurping authority from neighborhood boards. Leftist and liberal economists like John Kenneth Galbraith smile, denigrate our "" affluent society,""  make us feel guilty about our roots and profess that small scale village units would serve people better. Despite these preachings, the suburban community has served us well. We may snicker at the typical high schools we attended and we may deplore the fast-food chains in our towns, but growing up in that environment was not"
THE,
BUCH,
STOP,"that bad. In fact it was damn good for most of us. Recall those silly yet fun things like playing in Little League, go ing trick-or-treating on Hallo ween or attending the local Thanksgiving Day football game. The point here is not sentimen tality, but to recount the small yet memorable benefits of subur bia that elicit the envy of both ci ty and rural kids. I cannot imagine the continued growth of these communities in d efia n ce of our fren zied economy. Fewer people can afford homes; this trend will not soon end. Nor will cheap energy and transportation soon return. The number of young couples living in suburbs will most likely decline. I do not foresee extinction, however. It is too early to step in to the museum display. Enough people already in communities will stay to maintain the suburbs, perhaps on a smaller scale. And the social benefits will offset the economic drawbacks. The fate of our whole society will be determined in this decade by America's responses to fiscal and energy crises. If mass transportation becomes pro fitable and desirable, the suburbs will make a comeback. If inflation-recession cycles are halted, people will be able to af ford suburban life and we will not be the last generation. These are hopeful assumptions. But we suburbanites have always been optimists."

Unbearable cafeteria lines,"By KRIS FORSYTHE The lunch line crow ds, although tolerated in the past, have recently become obscene. For those eating in the cafeteria, especially those having to endure the agony of the fast pass, the lunch hour experience is transformed from a potentially pleasant repast to a nerve- shattering test of endurance. The problem begins at approx imately 11:55 a.m., when classes let out. Since two out of the three doors are locked, the first obstacle occurs in trying to squeeze through the one open door to the ticket punchers. Over worked though they are, the pun chers punch quickly enough to allow an overflow of diners to back up into the condiment table. If one is lucky enough to grab a tray--if there are any--the true test begins. Passing the confec tions (since they are invariably unreachable anyway), one at tempts to approach the ""main course."" People are virtually tied in a human knot, with nobody taking the 27 plates of food lined up on the shelf. The workers serving the food are often distracted: not with work, but with discussion about fall break rides and yester day's test. After grabbing any plate available, the beverages are next in the muddled procession. Assuming one has not been im paled by the catty-cornered milk machine, it is usually relatively easy to sidle up to the ice con tainer. However, finding glasses is tru ly difficult, and trying to break the one solid lump of ice without an ice pick is work fit for the physical plant. And, when one finally has the precious glass of ice, there is nothing but seltzer water to put in it. Now, with skim milk over ice and a cold hot dog, the diner must try to find a seat. The best bet is probably to sit outside on a picnic bench, even though it may be 35 degrees. And seconds are im possible, considering it is now time for 12:45 classes, and people are still waiting to get trays. An exaggerated observation? I think not. As for solutions, I look to the Dining Service and/or the administration. If something is not changed soon, I think the introduction of a 7-1 meal plan should be seriously considered.

'Tartuffe': French frivolity is,
But Pedro and Lempert give excellent performances,"And in both it is Patrick Pedro '81 who comes closest to stealing the show. From the moment of Pedro's entrance in the second scene as Orgon -- the master of the house in which the play takes place as well as the pivot around which all other characters move -- he leads the cast through the twists and turns of the evening with a finely honed sense of comedic tim ing. This is a good thing, too, for too often the rest of the cast as an entity is unable to keep up with the French playwriter's wit, translated somewhat laboriously into two hours of rhyming couplets by Richard Wilbur. Pedro handles the script and the com plicated staging finely, however. He sets the pace of the humor from center stage, for the play is much more Orgon's than it is the title character's. While Tartuffe is in its simplest form a play about hypocrisy personified by the title character, his qualities are brought forth by Orgon and the other members of his household. It is well that Pedro has been elevated from the role of comic reliever as Touchstone last fall to take on the central position here. Tartuffe, the falsely pious man whose actions are the subject of the play, should Photos--Joseph Ruszkiewicz Tartuffe, by Moliere. Translated by Richard Wilbur.

Greg Paris & Peter Shaw By DAVID HAWKINGS The Cap and Dagger production of Tartuffe this weekend in many ways parallels the dramatic group's staging of As You Like It for Parents' Weekend au diences a year ago. Both romantic comedies are laced with deceit, double identity and subtle and in creasingly complex twists of plotline. Like Shakespeare's play, the Moliere comedy on the Coleman Hall stage tonight, Satur day and Sunday is directed by University Theatre Director and Professor of English Harvey Powers."
"Orgon, played by Patrick Pedro '81, engages in an argument with his daugh",
"ter's maid Dorine, played by Cynthia Lempert '82. The two bicker constantly",
"in Moliere's comedy ""Tartuffe,"" which opened Thursday for a weekend run","definitely be the character second in strength and influence to Orgon. Un fortunately, senior Barry Fishel's inter pretation of the role is considerably less than overpowering. While his outlandish pontifications and fabrications could rival the farcical nature of Orgon, Fishel seems content to let Moliere's lines speak for themselves. This casualness is most unfortunate in the second act, when Tartuffe seems to lumber through an otherwise enthrallingly bawdy seduction scene with the buxom Elmire, the second wife of Orgon played by Amy Beth Cohn '83. While Cohn plays this scene -- and the rest of the play -- with an aloof and sophisticated coyness, Fishel seems only to be going through the mo tions. The other disappointing showing in a major role is by Dodie Rippon '82. As Orgon's mother Mme. Pernelle, she again fails to capture positive attention, something that has eluded her since her Bucknell debut in the Shakespeare comedy a year ago. In the opening night peorformance Thursday, Rippon seemed baffled and rushed, alternately mumbling through or overemphasizing the stilted patterns of speech Wilbur's translation is full of. As the actress charged with acclimatizing the audience in the opening scene with this un familiar method of dramatic technique, this is regrettable. The other comedy star and scenes stealer of the evening was Cynthia Lempert '82. As the loud-mouthed and live ly Dorine -- the maid of Orgon's daughter Mariane (Jackie Krull '83) -- Lempert ex ercises the rhythms and rhyme of the script with a caustic wit. The scenes she plays opposite Pedro, in which both vie hilariously for the last word and the atten tions of the audience, are perhaps the highlight of the production. Like the last Cap and Dagger mainstage production, unfortunately, even strong scenes like these appear lost in the visual surroundings created by the designer. Elaine Williams, visiting assistant pro fessor of English and theater, has designed a set evocative of a Louis XIV grand foyer, but the garish green and brown color scheme, the gaudy molding and banister work and the baroque stairway were poor ly detailed and shakily executed. It is a disappointment when compared to the model that greets patrons in the lobby."

Dodie Rippon '82 appears as Mme,
Pernelle (above) and Barry Fishel '81,

"Dagger version of ""Tartuffe.""","Two inexplicable questions remain for this reviewer. Why did the two servants continue to add items to the set between scenes? And why did a spotlight shine briefly on and then off a wall-mounted crucifix throughout Act I? Not to worry, really; these slight an noyances are overshadowed by the good will--if not the consistent standards of quality in all aspects of the staging--of this well intentioned piece of French frivolity."
Report recommends arts center and,"By LYNN RUTHERFORD A series of proposals designed to improve the artistic standing of Bucknell has resulted from a visit to campus in December 1979 by Julius Bloom, a New York talent im presario and consultant. "" We became aware of Bloom through a contact in New York. A trustee suggested that Bloom could be of assistance and paid his consultant's fee,""  University President Dennis O'Brien said. O'Brien accepted Bloom's proposals in January and is planning an open discussion of the document with selected members of the faculty, ad ministration and student body. No date for this discussion has been set. "" We are considering all Hie proposals and are trying to form a framework to begin work on them,""  O'Brien said. The 17-page report is comprised of an analysis of the current stature of arts on campus and of a series of seven suggestions to improve the cultural offerings of the University. Prominent among the areas of improvement is the need for a new concert hall. "" For what Bucknell should be achieving in its cultural programming,""  wrote Bloom, "" there is no doubt that it feels the lack of an adequate large hall, one seating at least 2,000 people."" Such a hall would also include back stage areas, workshops, storage space and possibly studios for per forming arts classes and groups, according to the report. The report says the inadequacy of Davis Gymnasium as a concert facility is obvious, and a study should be in stituted to determine what can be done immediately -- at relatively little cost -- to improve the accoustics of the gym. O'Brien disagreed with the first part of this proposal. "" It is doubtful that the University needs a concert hall with 2,000 seats,""  he said. "" However, a new concert hall is high on our priority list and there is a reasonable possibili ty of success in the acquiring of funds to build one."" Bloom's other proposed major adjustment of cultural policy concerned the formation of a "" new entity on cam pus which would be the University's service agency for cultural and intellectual programming, its promotion and further development."" This new agency would engage performing artists and arrange for their accommodations here, in addition to fulfilling the financial obligations of the cultural pro grams, Bloom's report said. The agency would also be the distributors of a new calendar of cultural events occurring both on campus and in surrounding local counties. He suggested that such a calendar would be published quarterly and serve to in form students and to draw the University and Lewisburg closer together. "" The rple which the University can fulfill in its large portion poses a major challenge and, boldly performed,"
new committee,"will enable Bucknell to project its image dramatically,"" wrote Bloom of an "" outreach""  program between the University and the town. The program would include per formances in schools by campus theater and musical groups, as well as presentations to the community by members of the faculty and administration. "" These suggestions are all reasonable and are being considered,""  O'Brien said. "" An arts committee is present ly in existence with (Director of Student Activities and UC Programs) Jim Hammerlee at the helm, but an agency of the sort described in the report would have far greater control over the calendar of cultural events."" Bloom commended the University's decision to play host to the Fitzwilliam String Quartet as resident artists in two of the last three years. "" What has been instituted with the residency of the quartet serves as an incentive for further development of Bucknell's cultural programming and enhancement of its national image,""  he said. O'Brien concurred adding, "" Resident artists add to the ongoing texture of the campus. Our policy leans more toward resident artists than one-shot superstars."" O'Brien said the Oct. 8 New York engagement of the quartet -- sponsored by the University -- was a critical success and widely publicized, giving the University na tional exposure."

Bruce Springsteen,
releases album 5,"ByERICHOERNER The long-awaited fifth album by Bruce Springs teen, entitled The River, was finally released this week after a gap of more than two years since the release of the last Springsteen album Darkness on the Edge of Town. The River, a two-record set, is a classic album. It j won't be long until it reaches the top of Billboard's album chart. The album is more similar to his first two albums, Greetings from Asbury Park and The Wild and the Innocent, than to his third and fourth, Born to Run and Darkness. Technically, The River is Springsteen's best album. The heavy orchestration and garbled lyrics of his earlier albums are absent--the instrumentals in every song are very clear and, with the exception of "" Crush on You,"" all vocals are intelligible. This is a contrast to the Darkness album on which the vocals in most of the songs are very difficult to understand."
"The cover of Bruce Springsteen's new album,",
"The River,",
released this week by Columbia,
Records. This is his first release in two years.,""" Hungry Heart,""  featuring Flo and Eddy on background vocals, will be the first song on the album to be released as a single. Although the songs on The River are like those on Side two tells the complete story of the pursuit of a Springsteen's first two albums, the mixing and girl, beginning with "" Hungry Heart,""  progressing engineering 6f the new one is far superior. This to ""Crush on You""  and "" I Wanna Marry You,"" en- album sounds best when played at a high volume. ding with "" The River."" The River contains the usual Springsteen themes of nighttime, driving cars and pursuing women, and he combines all three in "" Drive All Night.""  There are several sad songs, such as "" Wreck on the Highway,""  "" Point Blank""  and "" The River,""  but overall the songs are more positive than on previous albums, especially Darkness. Although most of the songs are brand new, Spr ingsteen performed "" Point Blank,"" "" Sherry Darl ing,""  "" The Ties that Bond,""  "" Independence Day"" and "" Drive All Night""  at various times during his 1978 tour. A performance of The River was also in cluded in the No Nukes movie. Springsteen's group, the E Street Band, is ex cellent as usual but the star of the band is Clarence Clemons on saxophone. Clemons has many solos and is the driving force in "" Sherry Darling,""  the "" fraternity rock""  song. Also notable is Roy Bittan's piano work in "" Point Blank""  and Max Weinberg on drums in "" Jackson Cage""  and "" I'm a Rocker."" The long wait for The River raised the expecta-, tions of Springsteen's fans. The album proves once again that Springsteen, as a lyricist and musician, is in a class by himself. It was worth waiting for."

BJRE spends 'A Night,
in Tunisia' and returns,
with an album in hand,"By ROBERT FESSLER Tunisia, Bucknell Jazz and Rock Ensemble's fifth album, is a virtual feast of music, ranging from the scat sounds of Count Basie to Stan Kenton's version of "" The Star Spangled Banner."" To be released within the next month, the album blends breathing musicality, spirit and just plain enjoyment into each piece, and""credits the musicians who compiled this jazz lover's delight. "" 500 Miles High,""  a chart by Chick Corea, features the inspired solo of Bob Galloway '80, the group's pianist. Perhaps the most ef fective piece of the album, "" 500 Miles High""  features clear, well- performed solos enhanced by a backup sound that does not over power them. Accurate articulation clinches the professionalism of the piece, to leave the listener asking for more. Basie's "" Blues in Hoss Flat""  proves that solos are not limited to an elite group of instruments. Jim Snedeker '81 shines with his baritone saxophone, one of the unsung instruments of jazz. Phil Woods' chart, "" The Last Page,""  combines a blues and swing sound with a fine alto saxophone solo given by Matt Murray, former member of the class of '82. The album, however, is not without flaw. "" Inner Crisis,"" by Blood, Sweat, and Tears, is indeed a crisis of overdone articula tions, pushy dynamics, lack of control and inaccurate notes. The otherwise sagging piece is saved only by superb use of special ef fects which create a mystical mood, diverting the listener's atten tion from the errors. The outstanding performance of "" South Rampart Street Parade"" easily overrides the problems of "" Inner Crisis.""  Clarinet soloist Tom Yuschok '80 is featured in this unusual blending of ear ly New Orleans jazz, moderate rock and a polka-like sound. The woodwind section displays its many talents and fuses the sound into a unified song. Stan Kenton's "" Star Spangler Banner""  brings out the patriot in every music lover, despite trumpet cracks and an intonation pro blem in the trombone section. This number is fresh, imaginative and reasonable well-executed. B.J.R.E.'s sensitive rendition of "" Reasons,""  an Earth, Wind, and Fire chart, is perfected by Murray's award-winning alto sax solo that conveys the song's mellow tranquility provides a magnifi cent solo. However, Elaine Christo '80, female vocalist, leaves the - listener disappointed, for although she has potential, her garbled words and uneven vibrato mar the song's otherwise fine sound. Dizzy Gillespie and Frank Paparelli's "" A Night in Tunisia,' the title cut of the album, gives alto sax player Yuschok a chance to display his inspiring ability. Yuschok is aided by the pleasant soft rock sound of junior Steve Armacost's trumpet. "" Make a Joyful Noise,""  by Dominic Spera, creates a musical collage by mixing the sounds of modern jazz, light rock and the light rag sound of Scott Joplin. The Bison Chips, Bucknell's barber shop quartet, perform a two-word solo in this unusual, yet striking ly appealing piece. Outstanding performances are given by Murray, the sensitive alto sax player who seems to have an emotional rapport with his in strument. Drummer Bob Ritter '83 holds the group together with a sturdy, well-interpreted beat, while Galloway's piano wizardry completes the sound of the group. Coordinators Yuschok and Murray did a fine job in selecting the highly talented group of musicians and the album provides an easy-listening evening of a variety of jazz. The Bucknell Jazz and Rock Ensemble has a hit in Tunisia that music lovers should take advantage of."

Lewisburg, despite its relative isolation  from  any large metropolitan areas and its rustic lack of worldly sophistication, of fers to the hungry Bucknellian and visiting parents a choice of dining experiences varying wide ly in cuisines and costs. Lewisburg proper, the one- street town of shops and vintage houses, contains within its tiny circumference four restaurants in walking distance of the Univer sity campus. Temperance House (N. 2nd seafood dishes, but the main at traction of this restaurant is its sumptuous salad bar. This spread includes not only the usual fare of lettuce and other basic salad fixings, but also a large variety of hot and cold vegetables, potato, relishes, con diments, cheeses, fruit, hot breads and butter and soup. The salad bar comes with. every dinner and is available as an entree ($5.45) for the weight conscious -- and even those who are not watching their diets. In keeping with this "" make-your- own"" theme, there is an "" ice cream sundae festival"" ($1.25) on the dessert list. The description reads: "" We provide the ingre dients -- you provide the im-"
"CHADWICK'S, Route 147, Northumberland.","Street. Open 4:00 p.m. to mid- agination."" night Saturday) provides a basic -- somewhat unimaginative -- but good menu of steak and seafood. Seafood ranges from fried clams ($4.95) to breaded shrimp ($6.50) with the expected broiled lobster tail ($11.50) heading the list. Steaks include chopped sirloin ($5.25), filet mignon (a reasonable $8.50) and New York boneless strip steak ($8.50,11 oz.; $10.25, 14 oz.). All dinners are complete and are served with a sidedish ' -- the b r e a d e d mushrooms are recommended -- , bread and butter and a beverage. The atmosphere is bland but shows a no-nonsense approach to eating that is both tasteful and in expensive. The Arena (At the junction of Market Street and Route 15. Open 4 p.m. to 11 p.m. daily), though attired in a rather overdone southern Mediterranean decor, serves well-prepared steaks, in cluding roast top sirloin ($6.95) and a prime rib of beef that comes in three sizes (petite $8.95, regular $10.95 and large $12.95). There is a small selection of The Arena is famous in the area for its frozen strawberry and banana daquiris. The Lewisburg Inn (At the cor ner of Market and Front Streets) is the most elegant dining room within the immediate vicinity. Situated in one of the restored houses that add to the pictures que scenery of Lewisburg, the Inn seats only 85 people at one 'time and offers a gracious am bience unavailable in any of the other restaurants in the town. Dinners vary widely in subject though they do not offer a highly unusual presentation. Fresh scallops broiled in butter ($9.25) and Alaskan king crab meat broiled in butter ($12.25) are good choices for the seafood afi cionado, while roast stuffed chicken ($8.00), leg of lamb ($8.00), New York strip steak ($11.75) and veal cutlet ($9.00) round out the menu. Every dinner includes a cheese and cracker plate, fresh rolls and butter, a tossed salad and choice of two fresh vegetables. For dessert the Inn offers special coffees ($2.50) and ice cream/liqeur creations ($1.75)"

The Valiant Trencherman (N. 2nd Street. Open for dinner 8 p.m .-ll:30 p.m., Fridav and Saturday; for lunch Saturday and 10 a.m.-2 p.m. for Sunday brunch) is the most innovative of the Lewisburg restaurants and gives diners who are tired of the average fare a refreshing change of pace. The menu centers on fish, chicken and vegetarian dishes, though it does not give the im pression of being non-gourmet. Stir-fried chicken in ginger and . garlic sauce ($6.65) is fresh and interesting, while crab-stuffed<< mushrooms ($7.50) gives the gourmand palate cause for celebration. Also available is a cheese fon due for two ($14.00) that is cer tainly satisfying for a duo of hungry people. Each entree is served with salad and choice of two fresh vegetables -- each of which has a new twist. For dessert there are cheese cakes and herbal teas (.35). Lunch has a similar menu with the addition of bagels, quiche, salads and sandwiches (prices vary depending upon garnishes). Sunday the highlight is brunch ($2.25, $3.50 or $5.00) featuring bagels, fruit salad, donuts, quiche, cheeses and onion soup. The .atmosphere is casual and relaxed without being sloppy -- m o r e  lik e  a G r e e n w i c h Village cafe than a Lewisburg eatery. For those exploring farther afield, the area _ holds two restaurants worth traveling to. All serve high quality food, bqj with prices to match, and are a driving distance of 10 to 40 minutes.

"LEWISBURG INN,","p.m., for lunch 11:30 a.m.-2 p.m. and for brunch 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Sunday) is an excellent restaurant with a gourmet fare equal to that of many New York establishments. The menu covers all areas of food from fowl -- including the typical duck a l'orange flambe ($10.95) and the more unusual chicken breast with broccoli and cheese ($6.95) -- to steak (averaging $9.75 j>er. dinner) to fish. Under this heading is listed frogs legs with sweet and sour sauce ($10.75). All dinners include a sidedish and the salad/bread bar (also available as an entree for $4.25). Dessert is the area where the proprietors reach a high point. Along with a special after-dinner drink ($2.25) diners can savor one of seven pies and three cakes. The Chadwick's olde English oatmeal cake has no equal in the area and deserves special atten tion. The lunchtime menu includes omelets ($3.25), salads ($3.50), crepes ($4.50) and sandwiches (from $3.00 for a fish sandwich to $4.75 for a grilled reuben). Hotel Magee (Exit 34 off Rt. 80. Open 4:30 p.m. to 10 p.m. for din ner, brunch is served 7 a.m. to 10:30 a.m. Sunday) is the most distant of the resta.urants but is by far the most renowned among Bucknellians. Its table haute menu includes such items as saurbraten ($10.25) in honor of the Oktoberfest, duckling with cherry sauce ($13.25), Viennese boneless chicken breast with mushrooms ($12.95) and stuffed flounder ($13.00). All dinners are served with a vegetable and potato, cof-"

This array contains salad items, shrimp, two kinds of soups, bread and butter and the equally well-known dessert bar. The bar-within-a-bar holds such scrumptious items as chocolate rolls, cheese cake, pies and black forest cake. The ambience is elegant to the hilt, and jacket and tie are required. Travelling time, the inconve nience (to some) of the dress and the cosmopolitan prices are all worth it for the experience -- at least once in four years' worth of Parents' Weekends -- of dining in the luxurious atmosphere of the Hotel Magee. For those on a stricter budget than any of the aforementioned dining places will permit, there is always the sparkling selection of fast-food places -- Wendy's, Mac Donald's, Durango's and Pizza City --on Rt. 15."

This endeavor became wearisome and embarrassing, as Eagles first encouraged the crowd to be extremely quiet, then extolled them to "" raise the roof six inches"" with cheers and ap plause.

Bisons tackle Rams Saturday,"By STEVEN SKOLNICK and MICHAEL SUAREZ The Bisons will try to Improve upon their 3-2 record Saturday in a contest against West Chester State College. Kick off is 1:30 p.m. for the Parents' Weekend clash. The Golden Rams sport a 2-3 record with victories over Glassboro, 35-14, and Friday's 41-17 victory over Bloorasburg. Their losses came to Delaware, the sixth ranked division I-AA squad, American In ternational and Millersville. The Bisons lead the series 2-0 with a 24-13 victory in 1977 and a 29-14 triumph in 1976. The Herd will have to contend with the Golden Rams' split veer offense, a formation the Bisons haven't seen in four seasons. Head Coach Bob Curtis states that the West Chester rushing duo of halfbacks Ron Perkins and Tyrone Scott "" may be the best pair we've seen this year."" Perkins, only a sophomore, has carried 95 times for 591 yards and two touchdowns in five games. Scott has 265 yards and four touchdowns on 51 rushing attempts and has returned eight kickoffs for a 26.3-yard average. In comparison, the Bisons' Ken Jenkins '82 has carried 97 times for 641 yards and four rushing touchdowns. He is also second in team receiving with 10 catches for 145 yards and three touchdowns. In addition, Jenkins' average of 184.2 all-purpose yards (rushing, receiving, kick returns) leads the nation. Quarterback Ron Gaynor directs the Golden Ram offense that averages 21 points per game. Gaynor has completed 36 of 71 passes for 630 yards and thrown for six touchdowns with only four intercep tions. Sophomore split end Bruce Carthon is the leading West Chester receiver, with 13 receptions for 325 yards and five scores. Defensively, the Golden Rams "" know they have to stop Jenkins""  stated Curtis. West Chester's 5-2 defense has allowed an average of 22 points per game. Curtis expects a physical battle, stating "" West Chester has excellent size. They're bigger than we are up and down the line."" The coach warns against underestimating the Golden Rams, noting "" they have good talent""  and are "" easily more talented than Slippery Rock,"" whom the Bisons defeated 25-6 Sept. 20. Curtis observes of the division II school, "" West Chester has nothing to lose and everything to gain-,"" adding,"" Don't look down your nose at West Chester. It should be an interesting game."""
Herd captures Homecoming tilt,"From HERD, page 24 tercepted by Leopard safety Tim M cAndrew, elim inating the threat. The Herd realized their defense had carried them through the first two quarters as they headed to the locker room deadlocked 0- 0 . "" The defense kept us on top"" commented Curtis, adding "" They left Lafayette thinking they would not make it to the end zone."" The Leopards could only manage two first downs and 44 total yards against the stingy Bison defense in the first half. Bucknell's scoring efforts of the half were stymied by poor execu tion, turnovers, penalties and in effective special teams play. The Bisons needed to generate more offense to win and wasted no time getting started in the se cond half. On the second play from scrim mage, Jenkins took a handoff from Locey and after Hall threw a block on Lafayette defensive end Ed Wallace, Jenkins followed pulling guards Darren Ford '81 and A1 Wehrhahn '81 until he spotted a seam created by the of fensive line. Jenkins accelerated through the gaping hole, ran over a Leopard defensive tackle, and when he hit open territory he headed for the right sideline on a 67-yard scoring jaunt. Depew's conversion split the uprights to give the Herd a 7-0 lead. On their next possession, the Bisons picked up right where they left off."
A,"17-yard Locey-to-Jenkins y a r d s a n d  s c o r e d b o t h touchdowns. "" He's as fine a back as I've seen around division I-AA, an outstanding open-field runner,"" commented Curtis. Jenkins' effort earned him his second ECAC division I-AA Of fensive Player of the Week honor this season. Jenkins remarked, "" I just did my job, the line opened up the holes.""  He added, "" I think it"
Jenkins took Locey's handoff and headed for,
a seam  in the defense. He bowled over a,
defender and headed for the right sideline,
on a 67-yard scoring burst.,"should be mentioned that the defense did it all today. They got their first shutout."" The defense held the Leopards to a mere 78 total yards behind the work of Hibbard, Dave Mann '81, Peter Mauritz '81, and Ed Zack '82. Zack filled in admirably at left end for Brucp Keltie '81 who moved to linebacker to replace the injured Pat Paro '81."

However, the gridders were given a second chance when a roughing the kicker penalty on the punt gave Bucknell the ball on the Lafayette 41-yard line. Fullback Daryl Cline '83 ran to the Lafayette 18 and Jenkins car ried to the seven-yard line behind a block from split end Mike Cor tez '81. Jenkins hit paydirt on the next play when he exploded into the endzone off right tackle. Depew's point after touchdown gave the Herd their final points of the 14-0 triumph. Jenkins was once again the workhorse for the offense as he rushed for a personal record 197 Curtis was pleased with the win but noted, "" We're going to have to do a helluva better job to con tinue winning. We must improve the play of the special teams. Un til we do, it will be a definite weak spot.

Soccer loses,
record falls to 2-4-1,"By BOB DAVIS The Bloomsburg soccer team edged the Bisons 2-1 in the rain Fri day night, to drop the Bisons' record to 2-4-1. The Huskies disposed of the Bisons on an unassisted goal by Luke Sakalowski 11 minutes into the first half and another by Toby Ran- ck late in the second. The Bisons' inability to turn scoring opportunities into goals, a problem that has plagued the team all season, cost them their third straight loss according to coach Craig Reynolds. "" It's the same old story and it gets very frustratin g /' said Reynolds, adding, "" I felt we controlled the game -- they only had three real scoring opportunities."" The Huskies were able to capitalize on their first break, a bungl ed clearing attempt by Bucknell deep in its own end. The ball was finally corralled by Bloomsburg's Sakalowski, who deposited it behind goaltender Peter Puccia '81 for a 1-0 lead. Bloomsburg's second score came on a penalty kick late in the se cond half. The Bisons dominated all other aspects of the game, outshooting the Huskies 30-11, but were unable to connect until Mark Brotherton '83 banged home a shot late in the game on an assist from John Krupka '81. Brotherton has scored in five consecutive games for the booters. Reynolds assessed his team's effort by noting, "" We didn't play poorly from, end to end, but weren't able to finish. It's a difficult situation to handle; we didn't play bad ball."" According to Reynolds, the prescription for the booters' offensive woes is to use more crosses and increase outside play. "" We've been forcing the middle too much."" He concluded, "" There's no magic solution -- we know what we have."" The Bisons host Rider tonight at 7 p.m. Their 1-3-2 record in cludes a 2-2 tie with Rutgers, a team that defeated Bucknell 3-1 Oct. 4. Reynolds commented, "" Rider is a big baUgame as the con ference is still up for grabs.""  The coach noted that Rider moves the ball well, employing a give-and-go attack. The formula for victory requires that the Bisons "" be aggressive in our defensive penalty area and hungry in the offensive penalty area,""  according to Reynolds. __________________________________"

Volleyballers win,
third straight match,"The women's volleyball team raised its record to 4-7 Saturday with a 3-1 win over Lafayette. The Bisons' third consecutive win is a Bucknell record, as are the four wins in a season. Coach Terrie Grieb called the victory "" a total team effort,""  as the Bisons downed the Leopards 15-10, 15-9, 2-15, 15-9. Grieb said she was pleased with the win. "" We didn't have the attitude to win before, but we do now,""  the coach said. Grieb pointed out the great ser ving game of senior captain Susan Bairstow as well as the overall strong play of Jeanne Groeneveld '83. "" Everyone played well, and the team was psyched for the game,""  she said. The Bisons' next match is at home against Gettysburg at 7 p.m. today. Grieb expects a tough match but says "" we'll win if we keep playing together. ' '"
Rinus Michels quits,
Aztecs for Germany,"R i n u s M i c h e l s o f  th e Netherlands, one of the world's most renowned soccer coaches, has left his position as coach of the Los Angeles Aztecs of the North American Soccer League. Michels joins Cosmos star Franz Beckenbauer as the second major N. A.S.L. figure to defect to West G e r m a n y ' s 18-team Bundesliga, considered the most competitive league in the world. Beckenbauer, a two-time Euro pean Player of the Year, an nounced in July his decision to join Hamburg of that league for next season. F.C. Cologne, which lost Coach Hennes Weisweiler to the Cosmos April 16, signed Michels as technical director of the club. Michels guided the Aztecs to a 20-12 record and a berth in the conference final this season. Under his guidance, the Aztecs reversed a trend of losing seasons, compiling a record of 38- 24. In 1979 Los Angeles also featured the play of Michel's pro tege, Dutch midfielder Johan Cruyff, now of the Washington Diplomats."
Four Bison golfers,
qualify for ECACs,"The men's golf team placed third in a field of 16 teams in the ECAC Southern Sectional quali fying tournament hosted by Bucknell Oct. 9, thus failing to qualify for the finals. Senior co captains Dave Richards and Rob Wagner, junior Mike Stoyla and s o p h o m o r e R i c k  C r a m e r qualified for the ECAC tourna ment finals to be held at the Penn National Golf Club Oct. 19-20. California (Pa.) State captured first place in the team champion ship with an aggregate score of 304, followed by Indiana Univer sity of Pennsylvania with 305. Bucknell tied Slippery Rock for third place with a 306 score. Ken Stauffer of Indiana Univer sity captured individual honors by carding a one under par 70. Richards and Cramer tied for fifth with 76 while Wagner and Stoyla tied for seventh with Tl> Peter Orr '84 finished with 81. Coach Jeff Ranck believes the Bisons did not play as well as they could have. He said valuable shots were lost on the putting greens which were very fast after being reconditioned for the 50th anniversary of the Bucknell Golf Club. A bad start hindered the Bisons' chances as the team was 19 over par after four holes. Only one bir die was managed by the entire five man team for the round."

Another scandal for,
USC athletic dept.,"The University of Southern California's department of athletics, acting outside the school's standard admissions procedures, directed the enroll ment of 330 scholastically defi cient student/athletes in the past decade. The majority of these athletes, according to a report released by USC's new president, were foot ball players. But each of the other 14 men's and seven women's in tercollegiate varsity squads had at least one of these athletes, all of whom failed to meet the minimum academic standards required of entering freshmen. A spokesman for USC -- which perenially yields teams that are among the finest in inter collegiate athletics -- said in Los Angeles Tuesday very few of these athletes had ever graduated from the university. The previous president had condoned this program, another university #spokesman said."

3-3 tie against,"By JEFF CROSS After tying Franklin and Mar shall Saturday in their first non losing effort this season, the women's soccer club gave a strong performance Sunday in a 3-0 setback to nationally ranked St. John Fisher of Rochester,"
N.Y.,"Against St. John Fisher, the squad played ""by far our best team effort of the year"" in losing by such a small margin, re marked coach Pete Puccia '81. The Cardinals boast a 7-1 record this year and outscored its opponents 84-5 last season en route to a 12-0 ledger. An indication of St. John's pro wess is that they defeated Penn State 4-1 at State College Satur day while the Bisons were thrashed 5-0 by the Nittany Lions Oct. 5. The Bisons battled St. John's throughout the first half but even tually allowed their visitors a goal with eight minutes remain ing on a hard shot to the upper right corner of the net from 18 yards out, according to Puccia. In the second half, the Bisons ""played them even,"" said Puc cia, but allowed two more goals. The Cardinals converted on a breakaway eight minutes into the half and closed out the scoring on a penalty shot by Marianne Laurini with five minutes re maining. Despite losing their sixth game in seven outings, Puccia said, ""We played them even in the se cond half,"" adding, ""We were pleased with our effort."" He con cluded, ""St. John's is probably favored to knock off Harvard in this year's national champion ship."" Harvard captured the na tional title last year. Bitser Dexter '82, playing 'stop per,' completely shut down Laurini, St. John's leading scorer who is considered ""the best center forward in the country,"" said Puccia. Freshmen Carey Grayson and Kim Andersou were ""outstanding on defense,"" added the coach. The Bisons' three goals in their tie with Franklin and Marshall Saturday proved their highest output in their two-year history. Mary Child '81 scored the first Bison goal of the game by in tercepting a pass in the F&M penalty area and blasting a shot by the Diplomat goalkeeper. Franklin and Marshall fought back, however, and led 2-1 by halftime. Anne Joyce '83 tied the contest early in the second half by volley ing home a shot with her left foot off a crossing pass from Jeanne Anderson '81. F&M again retook the lead and the clock ticked down on the Bisons. However, with only five minutes remaining, freshman Karen Bernstein picked up. a loose ball in the Diplomat penalty area and scored unassisted to give the soccer club its first tie of the campaign. The Bisons will try to gain their first victory in their season finale against George Washington Uni versity at 3 p.m. Saturday on the West fields. George Washington has an ""excellent women's soc cer program"" and earlier this fall ""lost in the finals to Penn State in the prelude to the Soccer Bowl,"" stated Puccia."
Tennis tops record,"By JAN BALAKIAN By shutting out Lock Haven 9-0 at home Wednesday and trounc ing Delaware 7-2 in Newark, Tuesday, the women's tennis team set a University record by winning their sixth match in one season. The netters have lost only to Colgate by a 6-3 decision Sept. 29. Patty Koch '83 opened the action against Delaware by surviv ing six service aces to topple Joyce Nidzgorski in first singles. Sarah Krieger '82 then bested Carol Renfrew 6-4,6-2 in the second singles slot. Delaware captured their first point when Kirsten Schubauer 81 lost 6-4, 6-7, 0-6, but Cindy Appel '83 fought tenaciously to defeat Meg Palladine 6-4,3-6,6-3 in fourth singles. Senior Janice Huber won the fifth position with an easy 6-1,6-4 victory over Carol Vigures but Laura Kirschstein '84 fell to Mary Ann Swikart 6-7,4-6 in the final singles slot. The Bisons swept the doubles as Huber and Krieger defeated Nidzgorski and Renfrew 7-6, 6-3, Koch and Appel conquered Palladine and Gray 7-5,6-3, and Schubauer and Kirschstein blasted HartelandWaechter6-l, 6-0. In the sweep against Lock Haven, Koch overwhelmed Karen Conn 6-0, 6-0 while Krieger used a powerful forehand to upend Denise Lebert 6-2,6-1. Schubauer continued the rout by knocking off Lori Emich 6-4,6 2 and Appel survived serving problems to edge Sharen Sazan 7-5,6 4. Huber used smooth strokes to trounce Gail Overdorf 6-0,6-2, and Kirschstein, despite suffering from a cold, conquered Page Carigan6-3,6-2. The netters end their season next weekend by competing in the Salisburg Invitational to which they will send four singles players and two doubles tandems."

Men's X-country,
still undefeated,"ByROBBYSTETZ and JEFF CROSS Weathering a soggy, slippery Delaware course, the men's cross country team recorded victories over the host Blue Hens, 21-40, and Lafayette, 15-50, in their final conference meet of the season. The victory extends the harriers' unbeaten streak to 72 straight opponents since 1974. Taking the early lead in the 5.1 mile race were Jim O'Shea '81, Steve Bigotto '82, Rick Sayre '82 and Bill Reifsnyder '84. Sayre noted, ""Coach Gulden wanted us to get out fast--we went out flying."" Sayre and Reifsnyder pulled away from the other two Bison runners after 1.5 miles, eventually cross ing the finish tape tied for first. Their 25:12 time broke the Delaware course record by an astounding 44 seconds. Nevertheless, Sayre commented, ""It wasn't an exceptional per formance,"" since "" it was a course record that could be broken. We weren't running that hard."" Delaware runners Mike Gahan and Matt Kelsh passed the Bison pack to finish second and third in 25:34 and 25:40, respectively. The Bisons clinched the victory, however, when O'Shea, Bigotto, Mike Debraggio '81 and Glen Gibney '83 finished together in fifth place with a 25:53 time. Mark Hulme followed close behind with a ninth place time of 25:59, as the Bisons placed seven of the first nine finishers. Reifsnyder, who won his third race in four outings, commented on his success, stating ""I didn't^ figure on being as high every meet. I'm sur prised and pleased."" In dispelling Gulden's early season fears of Reifsnyder burning himself out by running so hard in every race, last year's Pennsylvania high school champion stated, ""I feel stronger than at first. I have complete faith in Coach. The whole team is peaking at the right time."" The harriers compete in the IC4A championships Monday in New York. Bucknell has never run in the meet due to conflicts with the ECC conference meet. The harriers, ranked 16th nationally, will face"

Jo Burrell '83 races toward a second place,
finish in the Bisons' tri-meet sweep Saturday.,"such powerhouses as eighth-ranked Villanova, Boston University and Syracuse. Reifsnyder predicts, ""If we run well, we have a good chance of beating the competition. Villanova didn't run very well last week."" As for his individual strategy, Reifsnyder offered, ""I'll go out a lot faster my first mile to get good posi tion and then I'll just try to hold on."" Despite his considerable success thus far, Reifsnyder adds, ""There is no pressure on me. We have so much depth that one person can afford to have a bad day."" The squad is also aiming for a sixth consecutive ECC championship on Nov. 8 at Belmont Plateau in Philadelphia. Gulden states, ""Our number one goal is to win the ECC championship."" The Bisons can expect challenges from rivals St. Joseph's, who the Orange and Blue crushed 19-44 Oct. 4, and Delaware. Gulden predicts, ""The possibility of improving on last year's performance (17th in the NCAA cham pionships) is definite if everyone stays healthy."""
Women harriers win,"By JEANNE MINAHAN With seven of the top ten runners wearing orange and blue uniforms, the women's cross country team blazed by California (Pa.) Universi ty, 23-38, Lafayette, 15-50, and Messiah, 15-50 Saturday. Robin Brooks of California turned in the fastest time with a 19:40 first place finish while Jo Burrell '83 finished second in 19:57. Judy Olson '84 took third in 20:06 and Laura Gaydos '83 crossed the finish line fifth in 20:26. Junior co-captains Linda Accettura and Jean Lecates tied for sixth in 20:23, while Julie Crossman '83 and Nancy Nelson '84 captured eighth and ninth place, respectively. Coach Diane Ware noted the improvement by the Bisons over last week's times, stating, ""I'm happy with the way they ran; they've all been working hard and although the flu went through the team, they got better and did well."" With three weeks left in the season, the squad usually begins to ""taper,"" or reduce the running mileage required in practice. However, ""because of the flu we had to taper the mileage a week early so they could get better,"" commented Ware. The strategy evidently was successful Saturday as Bucknell cap tured first place for the second consecutive week. Despite an anemic condition, Burrell has been the Bisons' top finisher each meet. According to Ware, ""She has times that are close to Anne Bishoff's and Jo is only a sophomore."" Bishoff, who graduated last year, finished fifth in the Easterns and 33rd in the national meet last year. Accettura is ""doing super"" in her first season on the team, ac cording to the coach. Lecates ""had to take her sophomore season off due to an injury and she has come back and is running consistently well,"" added Ware. The team hosts the Bucknell Invitational at noon on Saturday at the West Fields' three mile course. Twelve schools will compete in the meet, won last year by Penn State. ""Penn State, Cornell, Indiana University of Pennsylvania and West Chester will be the toughest competitors,"" observed Ware."
Hockey drops pair; now,"By LISA CERUTI The varsity field hockey team was defeated by Bloomsburg 1-0 Tuesday after a disappointing loss to Lafayette Saturday. The Bisons played offensively throughout the Bloomsburg game, but their numerous shots on goal refused to pay off. Bucknell held the Huskies scoreless throughout the first half, but Bloomsburg broke the deadlock early in the second half. The Bisons were unable to come back, despite the fact that they ""played offensively at least 75 percent of the time,"" ac cording to co-captain Jill Henry '81. ""We held them throughout the first half but our shots just weren't going in,"" she added. Jeanne Minahan '83 played a strong game while goalie Betsy Doyle '82 blocked many of the Huskies'low drives. Henry commented that the te a m 's weakness against Bloomsburg was the same pro blem that the Bisons have had all season. ""Everyone played pretty well but our shots weren't ac curate enough. That's been our problem all year."" Lafayette defeated the Bisons 2-1 Saturday by scoring the winn ing goal in the last minute of the game. Although coach Sally Starr said the game was ""well played by both teams,"" the forwards were not ""directing their shots with enough finesse."" The Bisons had twenty shots on goal while the Leopards were held to five. Bucknell dominated the first half of the game in which Chrissy King '82 scored the only Bison goal after two minutes on an assist from Minahan. The Leopards tied the game 13 minutes into the first half and for the remainder of the contest both teams exhibited strong defensive play to keep the game tied until the final minute. Starr described Lafayette's winning goal as ""controversial."" She said ""the shot was lofted into the air near the goalie's head. It should have been called a dangerous shot."" Doyle ""had to worry about protecting her head, not guarding the goal."" ""It's unfortunate that the game has to look like a defeat. The team played exceptionally well and it's frustrating to come up with a loss after a game like this,"" Starr commented. The twin losses drop the team's record to 2-6. The Bisons host Lehigh Saturday at 11:00 a.m. Henry is optimistic about the game, stating ""We won last year and should be able to do it again."""

"Defense, Jenkins stop Lafayette 14-0","________ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ f << i By STEVEN SKOLNICK and MICHAEL SUAREZ In the Bison locker room before Saturday's game against Lafayette, one word scrawled in big, capital letters on the blackboard said it all. That word was "" REVENGE"" . The Herd had not defeated the Leopards since 1975, and although the Bisons had many chances to win last year, the teams tied 0-0. This year, Bucknell wasn't go ing to let it happen again. Throughout the first half, though, it was the Bisons' defense that kept them in the game. A misjudged punt reception and a hobbled snap from center on a punt resulted in Bucknell fumbles, giving Lafayette the ball in Bison territory twice within the first five minutes. Yet, the Herd defense stood its ground and Lafayette could not manage a first down. In the first quarter, the Herd of fense sputtered as they were unable to move past the 50-yard line. Senior defensive end Dave Hib bard thwarted the Leopards' fourth drive of the quarter with an eight-yard sack of quarter back Mark Lechmanik. Before the quarter ended, Lafayette twice gained posses sion within five yards of the mid- field stripe but was unable to muster any first downs. Not until the second quarter did the Bisons put together their first sustained drive. Starting on their own 20-yard line, the Herd marched down to the Lafayette 22 behind the running o f halfbacks Ken Jenkins '82 and Marshall Hall '83 and fullback Geoff Gallo '82. Faced with a fourth-and-five situation, Head Coach Bob Curtis elected to go for a first down in stead of a field goal because place-kicker Alvin Depew '81 would have to boot into a strong headwind.

Polo,
routs 4 more opponents,"By DAVE KIRKPATRICK Imagine scoring on your first 13 shots of the game. Now picture the opposing goaltender stopping only two of your team's shots in the en tire game. If you can envision this scenario you'll easily understand the results of the Mid-Atlantic league water polo tournament at Cornell last weekend. Bucknell won four games over the duration of the tournament to up their record to 11-1. The Bisons began by demolishing Lehigh 31-0, and continued by downing Indiana (Pa.) University 25-4, Cornell 21-7 and Penn State 27-7. Captain Scott Schulte '81 scored 10 goals against Indiana, tying a Bucknell record, and then smashed the record by tallying 11 times in 12 shots versus Cornell. Tom Butler '82 totaled 15 goals and 19 assists, while Mark Gensheimer '81 scored 17 goals for the tournament. The Bisons converted on a staggering 68 per cent of their shots for the weekend and have outscored the opposition 208-38 so far this season. Twelve different Bisons scored goals against Lehigh as Chris Layton '81, Dan Goss '83 and Jon Simone '83 led the individual scoring with four goals apiece. Gensheimer, Jeff Payne '83 and Scott Mutschler '84 had three each, while Butler, Schulte, Mark Corl '81 and goaltender Tony Pax ton '81 each scored twice. Mike Hoffman '83 played the last three quarters in goal for the Bisons, turning away all three shots he faced. Although the rest of the Bisons' victories weren't quite as convincing, they were never really challenged. The Bisons continually ran up the score in the first period and then coasted to victory. They led Indiana 13-2, Lehigh 10-0, and Penn State 10-1 after the initial stanza's of those games. The Bisons host their only home tournament of the year Saturday and Sunday. The competitive field includes the perennially powerful New York Athletic Club, as well as the Philadelphia Athletic Club, Richmond, Cornell, Navy, Slip pery Rock and Bucknell "" B"" , a team comprised of most of the regular second teamers minus Layton and Payne who will both play with the varsity. The New York Athletic Club figures to be the toughest competition. Last year Bucknell defeated the NY AC 3-2 in the tournament final."
All-Blacks score six tries during,
a 24-0 victory against Juniata,"_ ________________________ ___ _____ k n l f /vn O TMiri /i n n m f h o c irip l By D AVE LIONETTE The Bucknell All-Blacks trounced Juniata Saturday to even their record at 1-1. The 24-0 win featured six All-Black tries, while the squad showed signs of a maturing offense and maintained an aggressive defense. The All-Blacks got off to a slow start in the first half due to the unsteady play of the newly posi tioned backfield. As the game progressed, however, the team began to perform as a unit. Bucknell's first score came in the early part of the opening half when Bill Charlton '81 rambled up the sideline for the try. Later in the half, John Lester '81 found his way through the Juniata pack for the second score, concluding the first half with the score 8-0. The All-Blacks came out in the second half fired up, realizing their potential for a romp. The barrage began with a well placed pop kick by Steve Dixon '81 to winger John Demas '82 for the score. The next try came when Bucknell's pack pushed Juniata to their own goal line and Charlton took in the line out toss for his second score. The third All-Black try of the half came soon after when Roger Potdevin '83 blasted up (he mid dle on an assist by Steve Beck '82. Bucknell closed out the scoring when John Baum '83 hit paydirt on a run down the sideline. Bucknell's forwards played well throughout the game, while the All-Blacks' pack ran with the ball well, winning almost every scrum and loose ruck. Bucknell's strength and dominance over Juniata enabled them to get the ball to the backs throughout the game. The backs moved as a cohesive unit, ex ecuting plays and technique to the best of their capabilities. Don DeAngelo '81 aided the backs' successful attack by tear ing up Juniata's backfield with hard running and an accurate foot. The All-Blacks' 'B' side also crushed Juniata, winning 21-0."

'loose coalition',"By LISA CERUTI A group of 35 colleges and universities including Bucknell is considering the for mation of a "" loose coalition"" to exert in fluence on corporations operating in racially discriminatory South Africa, ac cording to University President Dennis O'Brien. _______- Two days after meeting with Dennis O'Brien and other college ad ministrators in New York City, Leon Sullivan called on American churches to divest their holdings in corporations which violate his Sullivan principles. Page 5. __________ __ ______ ________ .. The exact nature of the coalition -- and the extent of its "" loose"" structure -  has yet to be determined, O'Brien said. The schools represented -- which O'Brien said all have basically similar policies regarding opposition to in vestments in certain companies -- met in New York City Oct. 15 with the Rev.

O'Brien said he has recently written Swarthmore College President Theodore Friend, one of the organizers of the meeting, and asked him to expand on the discussions held in New York. O'Brien's stay at the meeting was cut short by a commitment in Detroit later that day, he said.

Reagan winner,

Anderson lacks strong support,"By DAVID HAWKINGS Ronald Reagan is the favorite presidential candidate of students here, in contrast to the overwhelming support for Rep. John Anderson at the vast ma jority of other Northeastern schools, a Bucknellian survey shows. The Illinois congressman -- whose independent candidacy has consistently scored highest with young and well-educated portions of the national electorate -- finished third behind Reagan and President Carter in a query of both potential and probable voters at the University. Reagan was the favorite of one- third the total number of respondents to the poll, and he had 35 percent of the preference expressed by those likely to vote Nov. 4. The president was the choice of 24 percent of the total sample. Of those planning to vote, however, 33 percent say they will cast their ballot for the incumbent, putting him in a virtual tie with the former California governor. The margin of error in the poll of 190 students -- or about 6 per cent of the school's student population -- is 2 percent. The random systematic sampling of opinion was conducted in telephone interviews Sunday through Tuesday. Anderson had 1 percent less support than Carter in the total poll, but fell far behind the two major party candidates with only 18 percent in the tabulation of probable voters.

"$1,000 tuition hike is likely next year",". nntpntial students are lost because of hit By DAVID GROSSMAN The latest proposal for a tuition hike for next year calls for a $1,000 increase, ac cording to a statement by University presi dent Dennis O'Brien at a meeting of the ABS congress Tuesday. The proposed increase, the fourth pro posal for a budget for the 1981-82 school year, calls for a 13.8 percent tuition in crease. This version of the budget also pro vides a 15 percent wage and salary in crease to all University employees. In an attempt to balance revenue and ex penditures, expenses for a new residence hall telephone system, second semester off-campus programs and plant deprecia tion reserves had to be eliminated from the budget. The fourth proposal is a result of an Oc tober 9 suggestion by Committee on Plann ing and Budget chairman Stephen Becker. At this meeting, Becker asked Vice Presi dent for Administration and Finance John Zeller to make up the fourth alternative, containing the $1,000 tuition increase and 15 percent wage hike. There are three other proposals for next year's budget. The first alternative pro vides for 10 percent wage increases, and a 12.5 percent increase in tuition. This plan, drawn up in April, was discussed during a committee meeting on September 24. It was agreed the committee would consider an alternative proposal at their next meeting. The second proposal developed was determined by "" national economic in dicators"" from the Department of Labor. The percentage of increase was determin ed through a weighted average of increase percentages over the past three years. This average, a 12.2 percent increase, was then applied to most important aspects of the budget, forming a second alternative for the Committee. In an effort to improve upon the two budgets that had already been drawn up, a third alternative was prepared by Zeller. Here, a 12.5 percent tuition increase was proposed, to help find a 12.5 percent wage increase. The Committee turned to a fourth alter- native. This option includes the most severe price hikes of all the proposals be ing considered at this time and provides a more balanced budget. Its tuition and wage increases surpass the rises that many colleges comparable to Bucknell have incurred thus far, according to a 1980- 81 Tuition and Fee Study compiled last April. Bucknell's fees this year are below the average and median costs of 17 col leges of Bucknell's caliber, according to the report potential students are lost because of high tuition, Smith said. The 15 percent wage increase proposed by the fourth alternative is higher than the proDosed increases of salaries of instruc tors at similar universities, according to a comparative survey. The survey, which reports the wages of teachers at Bucknell and compares them with those of several similar institutions, _nnrt states Bucknell professors earn salaries University Provost Wendell Smith said if better than the average for other schools^ ucknell s tuition is increased by "" too At Tuesday's ABS meeting, O Brien said a ULMIC11 3 ttuuvu . ."
__,". I1..1 on nf Mir AWTI Bucknell - --------------- - high"" a percentage, students might turn to less expensive schools. At the Committee's October 15 meeting, Smith said "" A $1,000 increase in com prehensive fee might place Bucknell in very poor position relative to schools we compete with. This could drastically hurt our enrollment."" Adherence to the percentages the University has used during the past three years would maintain a competitive tui tion rate. This would help insure that no final evaluation of our own wage increases cannot be made until the proposed wage increases of the other institutions are known. O'Brien also commented a $1,000 tuition hike is too high. He said it is in excess of a formula calling for no more than a 12.2 percent increase that the Committee should have worked with. He said more ex tensive statistics from other schools would help the Committee reach its final decision on tuition and salary hikes."

Ahlstrom, speaking in the University Center Forum Monday night, raised the question, "" What impact have religious at titudes had on the social order?"" _* ,, Ahlstrom's lecture, "" Puritanism and Quakerism: Reflections on the Relation and Social Order,"" was the first in a series of sixteen lectures dealing with religious traditions in Pennsylvania spon sored by a grant from the Public Committee for the Humanities in Pennsylvania. ' . , .. Associate Professor of Religion William Becker directed the presentation, and estimated that an audience of ninety persons at tended. . ... The high turnout of local residents was partly a result of publicity generated by letters sent by the Public Relations Office to local clergy, Becker said. . . . There were also several articles publicizing the lecture published in local newspapers, Becker said. Ahlstrom is a professor of American religious history at Yale. He is the author,of A Religious History of the American People. The book discusses the influence of religion on American society, and received the National Book Award in 1973. , - ,, America is a unique country in that it is a "" product of the Bible, Ahlstrom said. Founded partly as the result of a "" religious move ment"" in England, the United States has become the most religiously-affiliated country in the western world,""  according to The struggle of various theologians to make their ideas dominate the American view of religion, he added, made this country ' alert to the development of power."" ___ Two additional lectures on the theme of "" Paths of Faith in Penn sylvania"" will be held here.

for,"the "" time and effort""  spent. Dzurinko said he has "" met informally with Associate Professor of Political Science John Peeler, and that it is likely that department will sponsor his proposal for student government credit. "" The department is generally open to non- traditional studies,""  Dzurinko said. He said this was his reason for seeking sponsorship from the depart ment. . . . . ,, Dzurinko said because of the "" career orientation and "" GPA mindedness"" of students today, there is a "" smaller pool of students available for extra curricular activities."" "" Curricular and extra-curricular activities must be combined"" in order to generate interest, he said. The current interest in extra-curricular activities -- which Dzurinko sees as low -- is a "" reflection of the times,"" he said. The student government here is ""basically inactive,"" with enough students capable of participation, but with "" those willing on the decline."" ment,"" he said. There would also be required readings on how to be more successful dealing with campus happen ings from the student government's perspective,"" Dzurinko said. ,, , . The proposal Dzurinko is making calls only for the ABS president to receive academic credit. He said, however, that he will be seeking credit for the ABS treasurer if his proposal for credit for the president is successful. Dzurinko said as ABS president he works an average of "" 10 hours weekly, maybe more."" He said this time is in addition to "" as much as eight hours in meetings alone"" certain weeks. Both the L'Agenda and the Bucknellian editors have traditionally received academic credit for their work. Jim Zimmerman '81 receives academic credit for one semester for serving as editor of the yearbook. Ken Quaas '82 also receives academic credit one semester, as editor of the Bucknellian. Quaas said he works "" at least"" a 40 hour week. Quaas said section editors for the newspaper "" work an equivalent amount,"" and should receive academic credit as well. He said the five section editors do not receive "" any academic credit."" HOPEFUL STUDENT MODELS-- Williamsport photographer Terry Wild takes test shots of students Tuesday in the academic quad.

Amherst 'Student' not printing,
after school cuts appropriation,"The student newspaper of Amherst College stopped publishing this week after its funds were cut by a student committee, according to a report in the New York Times Wednesday. In a letter to the Bucknellian Oct. 8, Opinions Editor Christopher Bohjalian of the Amherst Student said, "" The Student Allocations Com mittee has threatened to cut our budget to about 50< if we do not begin to take drastic measures to cut expenses."" The committee allocated about half of the $15,500 the paper needed to continue publishing. The twice-weekly newspaper had a $35,000 annual operating budget, about half from allocations from a student tax and the other half from advertising revenues. "" Amherst College is the only respectable college in the country without its own student-run newspaper now,"" said the paper's publisher, Barry Volpert."

DENNIS O'BRIEN,"From APARTHEID, page 1 O'Brien said Sept. 24 he is not sure a commitment to total divestment of economic holdings with companies discriminating against racial minorities in the republic is the way to "" best use our in fluence"" to achieve more equitable treat ment for blacks there. Speaking at a seminar as part of the "" Justice in America"" program of the Bucknell Student Lectureship, the presi dent said working from within the system could produce "" better results"" than the "" working outside the system"" he said total divestment would force. The University Board of Trustees adopted a policy of selective divestiture when it voted in December 1979 to boycott companies not following the six Sullivan principles. An ad-hoc committee of the board of trustees is also making a review of com panies with South African subsidiaries to determine if they are following Sullivan's six principles. Sullivan -- who recently returned from a trip to study the variety of corporations in South Africa -- was the principal speaker at the Oct. 15 meeting. "" There are two ways in which change can occur in South Africa,"" Sullivan said. "" One is bloody and the other peaceful."" He said he hopes selective divestiture "" will slowly break down barriers without bloodshed."" Dean of Student Affairs John Dunlop, who chaired the student, faculty and trustee committee which proposed selec tive divestment to the board, said, ''most companies in which we have holdings support the Sullivan Principles at this point."" O'Brien said "" nothing has happened"" in the interim since the board vote a year ago. "" There is really no need to review the policy now,"" he said."
Bridge study begun,
to determine options,"From BRIDGE, page 1 Vice President for Administra tion and Finance John Zeller said he would like the University to in stall additional lighting at the in tersection, and is seeking permis sion from the Pennsylvnaia Department of Transportation to do this. Mileo said lighting "" would not have prevented"" McNerney's ac cident earlier this semester. Zeller is opposed to construc ting a bridge because he does not "" think students will use it."" He said it would also have to meet re quirements for handicapped per sons. Mileo said the bridge he hopes to design would have provisions for the handicapped. "" The big gest obstacle seems to be money,""  he said. He said he would be meeting with Zeller this week to discuss options for making the intersec tion safer. Mileo met with PennDOT of ficials in Danville Tuesday to look at a footbridge which crosses over Route 54 there. He said he would also be looking at the tun nel under Routes 11 and 15 in Shamokin Dam. McNerney's roommate, Fran Odell '81, said she is researching the number and nature of ac cidents that have occurred at the intersection since 1972, when traf fic lights were installed. She said she also hopes to conduct a traffic flow study to see if there is a cor relation between "" increased traf fic flow and number of ac cidents."" She said she will use the data to ""propose"" a "" course of action."""
Student is released,
from medical center,"By MADELON HENEHAN Mary McNerney '81 was discharged from Geisinger Medical Center in Danville Sunday. She was hospitalized -- originally in critical condi tion -- Sept. 23 after she was struck by a car while crossing Route 15 at Moore Avenue. While in the hospital, McNerney had physical therapy twice a day. "" She is up and walking but can't see very well now,"" according to her roommate, Fran Odell '81. McNerney underwent treatment from an eye specialist Monday about the "" possibility of cosmetic surgery,""  according to Odell. Odell said McNerney's "" spirits are really good."" She does not know if McNerney will return to the University, or if so, at what time. McNerney could not be reached for comment. The accident occurred at 8:45 p.m. as McNerney crossed the in tersection on her way to the Bucknell West, where she lives. She was struck by a car driven by William Belsky of Lewisburg, who is alleged to have run the traffic light which was red for vehicles on Route 15 at the time. Vice President for Administration and Finance John Zeller said he is seeking to make the intersection safer for students making the crossing. "" Immediately after the accident we wrote to the highway department (the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation), ask ing permission to install lights,""  he said. Zeller said he has still received "" no response."" Mike Mileo *81, and Bryan Ritter '82, are currently working on a CivU Engineering project with the goal of "" making the crossing safer"" according to Mileo. They are conducting a study to determine the feasibility of constructing a foot bridge across the highway. Mileo said Zeller is only seeking to ""placate"" students by having more lighting installed. "" More lighting would not have prevented the (McNerney's) accident,""  Mileo said."

Sullivan urges churches,
to join apartheid battle,"a> Q iilh n r on H n a m o c o lr o  o f n rin P in lP S The author and namesake of the six Sullivan Principles has also called on all American chur ches to divest themselves of any holdings they have in companies refusing to improve the condi tions for their workers in South Africa. The Rev. Leon Sullivan made the statement at a news con ference Friday at the National Press Club in Washington, two days after his meeting in New York City with University Presi dent Dennis O'Brien. "" I am asking any church with any connection whatsoever with one of these companies in South Africa to discontinue their association including withdrawal of stocks,""  Sullivan said. "" Apartheid has got to come to an end one way or another. If we don't exert pressure now with economic means, there will be a war to end it,"" he said. Sullivan is the chairman of the International Council of Op portunity Principles and the pastor of the Zion Baptist Church in Philadelphia. He issued a report on 140 companies with South African affiliates who have agreed to examine their policies toward blacks, coloreds and Asians. Of these companies, Sullivan found 37 to be making "" good pro gress"" implementing the prin ciples. The remaining companies were judged to be making either "" acceptable progress,"" or as having failed to implement the principles. Most pressure on American companies doing business in South Africa has come from col leges and universities. More than 20 schools have policies pro hibiting the investment of money from the institutions going into South Africa, while Bucknell has endorsed a partial divestiture policy. Half of the 500 largest corpora tions in the United States have af filiates in South Africa, with in vestments totaling $2 billion, ac cording to the Washington-based In v e sto rs R e s p o n s ib ilit y Research Center."

Greece reunites with,
NATO armed forces,"After a six-year hiatus, Greece rejoined the military forces of NATO Monday, consolidating the alliance's vital southeastern flank. Greece withdrew from the military wing of the alliance in 1974 to protest the Turk invasion of Cyprus. Turkey maintains military oc cupation of part of the island. The Turks had opposed Greek re-entry to the military alliance until now. Turkey had demanded a bigger share than before in command and operational con trol responsibility in the Aegean Sea area. Since the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan and the Iran-Iraq war, Turkey has made several gestures to improve relations with Greece and has softened its opposition to Greece's full return to NATO. NATO's concern over the Greek-Turk dispute stemmed from the realization that the alliance's central European front was fairly stable, but that a main danger for conflict seemed likely to come on its northern or southern flank. Turk leaders welcomed Greece's return to the military wing, saying it reinforced the alliance and was in Turkey's own interests."

After criticizing the women's ""false goals of cars, clothes, beauty and boyfriends"" in his column, Carney went one step further. He called on SMU fe males to go without makeup for a day, then he stood on campus in his underwear, asking women if he could wipe their faces with a cotton swab to determine if ""their beauty was natural."" Seventy-five women passed the test by not wearing makeup, 15 failed, and 107 refused to sub mit to the scantily-clad column ist's demands."

"He's not a Churchill,but Ronnie is not a senile fascist",". . ____ __ i tn aat an arms limitation treaty By TODD G. BUCHHOLZ Add Richard Brockhaus to the list of those who do not practice what they teach. Last week, on the page opposite this column, the assistant pro fessor of philosophy and logic presented a horrendously faulty and fallacious argument on why we should vote for Jimmy Carter. Buried under hyperbole and calumnies, the gist of Brockhaus' assertions was: 1) Reagan is "" a senile fascist.""  2) A vote for Anderson is a vote for Reagan. 3) Carter is the only alternative. I will reluctantly accept the se cond statement. The rest is folly. R eg retta b ly , B rockhaus waltzed into the trap set by the Carter camp and was duped by their campaign strategy. Under Robert Strauss' supervi sion, Carter has spent months in sinuating and outrightly accusing Reagan of being trigger-happy, atavistic, simple and a risk to anyone who wants peace. Instead of presenting reasons why Reagan is so monstrous Brockhaus simply tells us that "" the spectre of a Reagan presidency is so frightening that we ought to try anything to avoid it.""  Why is it frightening? He doesn't tell us, I guess it's com mon sense among philosophers. If webad wanted unproven con clusions, we could have watched"
THE,
BUCH,
STOP,"Carter television commercials or read New York Times editorials. To discredit Anderson's efforts and compound the illogic, Brock haus uses a fatuous analogy. "" Many of us, including your nar rator, said, as November 1968 ap proached, Humphrey, Nixon... what's the difference? and so voted for Eldridge Cleaver or Moose Skowron or Mickey Mouse, or whatever."" Brockhaus then implies voting for Cleaver and friends took away votes from Humphrey, and thus elected "" a dangerous paranoid named Richard Milhous Nixon.""  Wrong again. Most voters who said "" Hum phrey, Nixon, what's the dif ference?"" chose the lever marked George Wallace. And * Wallace stole more votes from Nixon than Humphrey. There fore, if citizens who turned from the two major candidates had stayed with the Democrats and Republicans, "" Tricky Dick""  _ would have won by an even larger plurality. Sorry professor, but now you don't have to feel guilty about your vote in 1968. Let's be honest and try a little reason. Campaigns are like our cafeteria's air pie; they're most ly fluffy stuff. If we want to be good citizens we can discern bet ween Carter and Reagan. A vote for Reagan is a vote for less federal government, freer enterprise, stronger defense and more local control over and responsibility for social pro blems. A vote for Carter represents ex pansion of the federal govern ment, regulation of business, who knows what kind of defense and more federal help or interference in battling social ills. to get an arms limitation treaty passed. Why should the Ameri can people vote for you and think that you are the best candidate? "" Ronald Reagan is no Churchill, but he's not a senile fascist. Reagan's view: that jobs are created not by government but by business; that businesses must"
"If we had wanted unproven conclusions, we",
could have watched Carter television com,
m ercials or read New York Times editorials.,"Choose for yourself. But I'm appalled at the status quo and the flimlpss route we followed to get here. A reporter put it best on Meet the Press when he asked Jimmy Carter something like this: "" Mr. President, inflation has hit 20 per cent this year, we are now in a recession, the Russians are in Afghanistan, 50 Americans are in Iran, your secretary of state has left you, your brother is being in vestigated for being a foreign agent and you haven't been able expand in order to hire; that in vestment is necessary for expan sion and that taxes and regula tion discourages investment is simple--and pragmatic. And our best hope for economic recovery. His notion that the Soviet Union as aggressive and expansionist is exaggerated yet well-founded. Reagan's vision of a pros perous and strong America is a bit sweet. But Carter has no vi sion. Would a logical man choose rose-tinted sunglasses or blinders to walk into the 1980s?"

Questioning with fervor,
We thought at first our presidential survey results would be,
"similar to those at other "" frame of reference"" schools. John Ander",
"son--who the national media has labeled the "" darling of the kids, the",
"profs and the (college) grads"" --would emerge as the clear favorite",
in this hothouse of academia as he has at so many others.,
How regrettably wrong we were. Regrettable not because the,
campus choiee was not our own--a presidential endorsement is not,
the aim here--but because this may show once again the unwill,
"ingness of the student body to think freely, passionately and dif",
ferently.,
The similarity of our results to national polls seems to show,
students here to be middle-aged before their time; at the last mo,
"ment we can question and challenge things social, intellectual and",
"political without practical repercussion, we seem content as a col",
legiate entity to absorb whatever is put before us.,
"It often seems that the "" hothouse"" atmosphere of life here has",
"given us "" frame of reference"" of inbred, passive conservatism.",
Perhaps those committed to instilling what Professor Jack Wheat-,
"croft calls "" The Art of Disbelief""  in the rest have been too vociferous",
and caused our audience to once again shut its ears.,
"The emergence of Reagan and the quashing of "" The Anderson Dif",
"ference"" here, though unusual for an eastern college, is not in itself a",
cause for panic.,
What is alarming is the inability of our constituents--often even,
our own reporters--to question and challenge their facts and beliefs,
at every opportunity.,
Living with criticism,
The Bucknellian has a policy of printing critical as well as,
positive reviews of performances. The most recent of these articles,
"appeared in last week's issue, and the reaction they received con",
firmed the saddening fact that an alarming number of students here,
have not yet learned how to handle criticism.,
"Not all reviews will be good, and any performer with integri",
ty-professional and college student alike--will take the bad ones in,
stride with some semblance of grace. That grace is painfully absent,
"here, and the University has frequently been subjected to petty",
displays of hurt feelings.,
Part of the college experience comes from examining mistakes,
and striving to eliminate them; two paragraphs of valid critique are,
far more valuable to someone truly interested in learning and im,
proving than are two pages of undeserved praise for a scrapbook.,
"As soon as he goes before an audience, a performer opens",
himself to criticism--either by word of mouth or in a newspaper.,
People here must be willing to take the consequences of public,
display. They should not question the right of a journalist to do his,
job and bring into serious doubt their own qualifications.,
Winning with integrity,
The reputations of many universitites have been tarnished in the,
"past few months by revelations of tampered transcripts, academic",
dishonesty and recruiting violations. One athletic scandal after,
another has been uncovered.,
"The "" win at aU cost"" philosophy in intercollegiate athletics serves",
"to bolster the overall reputation of a university, but at the cost of",
"dropping academics from top priority in the minds of students,",
"faculty, administration and coaches.",
"The success of two athletic teams this season, and earlier this",
"week in particular, has given a far loftier reputation to this institu",
"tion, yet our academic reputation remains unaltered.",
"Coach Art Gulden's men's cross country team, winners of four",
"consecutive ECC titles and 72 straight dual meets since 1974, re",
corded a stunning victory in the IC4A meet Monday against other,
"eastern cross country powerhouses, many of whom use scholarships",
to entice athletes to enroll and compete.,
"Dick Russell's water polo squad, winners of 99 of 111 games in four",
varsity campaigns and participants in three straight NCAA cham,
"pionships, captured the Bucknell Tournament with a rousing cham",
pionship game triumph.,
"As both teams continue their march toward the NCAA finals, they",
must be commended for giving the University national athletic,
recognition without compromising academic standards.,

Arts Association accomplishments,"To the Editor: The "" Advancing the Arts""  section of your October 17th editorial page was filled with equal amounts of inaccuracies and venom. Unless your intent is to discourage such an endeavor, you might want to make a few corrections. The Association is not the "" overall coordinator for all the arts organizations now in existence.""  It is an Alumni-sponsored group whose main aim is to get a Center for the Performing Arts built and whose lesser aims are to present an annual Celebra tion of the Arts, a week of cultural events and to en courage the arts on campus wherever and whenever it can. The Association is only five years old and as a baby in the arts can be proud of bringing to the cam pus such outstanding people as John Ciardi, Cicely Tyson and Edward VUlella. On March 13,1981, we will have John Houseman here for a lecture and workshop. We have given financial support to the initial residency of the Fitzwilliam String Quartet and have pledged another $1,000 toward bringing them back in the future. We have recently established a C. Willard Smith Award for Dramatic Excellence to honor an outstanding person in the field of drama. How much do you think it would cost to hire a pro fessional coordinator for the arts? Our total treasury is about $15,000, a sum that would pay for only part of his first year. As an alumni-sponsored and alumni-directed group we are governed by a code of rules adopted by the Association and adhered to by its officers. The University would have no right to "" take charge of and reshape"" us. Rather than hire a professional to coordinate the arts, I would suggest that Bucknell find a profes sional newsperson to teach you and your staff ac curacy in reporting and proper tone in writing.

Bucknell Recycling Group lauded,
#*,
_nks,
blood donors,"To the Editor : On behalf of the League of Women Voters of the Lewisburg area I want to thank the Bucknell Recycling Group for their efforts in expanding recycling beyond the University and into the com munity. The League recycling committee under the direction of Nora Elze had been working on community awareness of the necessity for more recycling, but it was not until we had the active support and participation of the Bucknell Recycling group this past year that we were able to begin to realize this goal. The Bucknell Recycling Group was largely responsible for a very successful pilot project last spring in which targetted areas of the borough received curbside pick-up of recyclables. Because of the enthusiasm generated by this effort, other groups in the community were made aware of the possibilities of large scale recycling. The local chapter of the Kiwanis, who already ran a mon thly glass drive, agreed to in crease their program. They have now installed a large sign identi fying the glass center and have placed barrels for the deposit of glass and aluminum outside the building which permits drop-off at any time. The League has worked hard to publicize the pro ject and is currently working on a handy flip-card manual with in structions on how and what to recycle. In short, the League is pleased with what has been done so far to raise the consciousness of the community in this important area. The Bucknell Recycling Group's aid has been invaluable. Although monies from this endeavor would be well spent on a scholarship for a local high school student, the community as a whole would better benefit from the increased efforts to improve the efficiency of recycling and its further expansion. From our ex perience with the Bucknell Recycling Group, we have no doubt they would not only use past monies wisely, but would return them twofold -- the expan sion, bringing more money for scholarships. Alice B. Chambers President Lewisburg League of Women Veters To the Editor: On Thursday, October 16 Bucknell students again demonstrated their concern for those less fortunate than themselves with a very successful bloodmobile visit. 290 pints of blood were donated with 26 referrals. The drive, sponsored by Concern and Action, was superbly organized by Beth Sipple. Alpha Phi Omega service fraternity pro vided the manpower to set up and take down all the necessary equipment. To these people and all the donors and helpers, many thanks from the Union County Chapter of the American Red Cross and, of course, from the patients in the hospitals of the Northeast Region who will benefit from their generosity. Donald Old, Associate Professor of Mathematics Campus Representative, The American Red Cross"
Mentor of logic faulted,
Negative criticism is very painful,"To the Editor: I am writing this letter at the risk of seeming overly sensitive. I have tried unsuccessfully to forget about the caustic review I received from the Bucknellian's David Hawkings, for my per formance in Tartuffe. I am a theater major and take my art very seriously. It is extremely painful to read a negative criticism of one's work, but it is worse when the in tent of the reviewer seems to go beyond corrective criticism. If my performance was poorly executed that is one thing, but the reviewer went on to bring up his dissatisfaction with my entire career here. I feel that I am being cheated out of an important"
Professor,
Appalls,"To the Editor: I was appalled to see such an a rticle  as R ich ard Brockhaus' in last week's Bucknellian. I think that the "" article""  should have been placed in the Letters section, as it was clearly nothing more than the spouting off of that author's own personal opinion. I think that the Bucknellian made a mistake in granting space to what I feel was a slanderous attack on Ronald Reagan and the Republican party in general. ______ ________ Rob Tyrrell '84 Ed. note: opinionated articles us ually appear in the opinions sec tion. part of my college experience. For the hours and hours of studying, rehearsing and performing, I am not allowed the simple pleasure of sharing an even somewhat fair review with my family and friends. I would like to know how I got cast if I am truly such an inadequate performer. They say one should ignore reviews, but I guess I am just not that thick-skinned. However, consider ing that Hawkings and I are both members of the Class of '82,1 will probably acquire the hide of an ar madillo by the time I graduate."
__,"___________________________ Dodie Rippon '82 Ed. note: The review did not express ""dissatisfaction with (Rippon's) entire career here; ""1t said she has ""failed to capture positive uitention since A s You Llk# It."
Arts need understanding,"To the Editor: Announced with the clumsy headline, "" Tartuffe: French frivolity is not fine,""  David Hawkings' review proceeds likewise in a reckless manner. He neglects his responsibility to help the audience understand this complex and contextual comedy and seems to prefer the lighter task of pointing out the "" disap pointing showings"" , of two cast members. This verbiage is at the expense of mentioning the meritorious performances of much of the cast, including Scott Sherman as Cleante and Jackie Krull as Mariane. At Bucknell, where the arts need understanding and respect, I question the worth of this lazy criticism, and for that matter his understanding of the play. Does Hawkings expect gratitude from the cast, director and designers for his patronizing consolation compliments of their "" good will"" To the Editor: Upon reading Professor Richard Brockhaus' opinions of Ronald Reagan in last week's Bucknellian, (he called the"
G.O.P.,"candidate a "" senile fascist""  among other things), I was at first startled and then totally outraged by the irrespon sibility of his comments. I felt that such a blatant display of overly-emotional rhetoric re quired a response. My anger stemmed primarily from the manner in which Brockhaus presented his opi nions. His method was to throw out an opinion, usually based on overgeneralizations or false assumptions, and then provide no factual support for his venemous comments. (I believe his type of argument is based on an informal fallacy in the form of ad Hominem abusive, which is cer tainly an inexcusable error for a mentor of logic.) The presidential candidates themselves have employed this tactic of "" negative campaign ing.""  The public, however, seems to reject this approach; the poll- standings of those issuing per sonal attacks are lower than and "" intentions?""

University chorale joined by orchestra,
",",
"Pusey, Gems and Chips","ByAMYFORTGANG Successful performances were turned in by both the Bucknell Symphony Orchestra and the Bucknell University Chorale Saturday evening in Rooke Chapel. The traditional Parents' Weekend concert of the Chorale, conducted by Professor of Music Allen Flock, was made more interesting and enjoyable through the diverse program offered by the or chestra, the Sem Gems, the Bison Chips and the bag-pipes of Associate Professor of Japanese Studies Jamie Pusey. This weekend was the first time in the past three years a conglomerate concert has been attempted, and the result was superb. The program opened with the orchestra's rendi tion of ""Overture in the Italian Style"" by Schubert conducted by Christopher McGahan, assistant pro fessor of music. The performance was of surprisingly high caliber, especially the quality of the violin section. There are only two complaints, both of which can easily be corrected in any future performances. Although the piece and the orchestra were outstan ding, it was a shame the audience had already heard the overture rehearsed three or four times before the actual performance. The next time such last minute rehearsal is re quired, those in charge should keep people out of the auditorium until the run-through has been com pleted. This will avoid spoiling an otherwise plea sant concert with repetition of the work. Pusey provided an unusual sight as he marched up the aisle of the chapel in full Scottish regalia. He performed reels, marches and dirges of the Scotsmen on his pipes and gave a welcome touch of originality to the concert. The choral portion of the concert was enjoyable because of the quality of the voices and the varia tion of the program. From Latin prayers and psalms, the singers moved to Slovak folk songs, in the abstract style of Bartok that some find unplea sant. Junior Virginia Church's clear soprano voice, ac companied by Marianne Simonetti '82 on the flute, soared through the solo in ""Weep, 0  Willow"" by Lekberg, while Claude Mason '82, baritone, por trayed a somewhat ""un-Jewish"" but still comedic Tevye in ""If I Were a Rich Man"" from Jerome Boch's Fiddler on the Roof. ""Hie Echo Song,"" an innovative piece by di Lasso, utilized a choir of nine answering voices to represent the echo. ""Ching-A-Ring Chaw"" is an in ane song by Aaron Copland that could easily have been eliminated. The concert, tastefully short, ended on a light note with the Sem Gems (Karen Levine '81, Kristin Olsen '81, Melissa Bodine '81 and Jill Stranko '81) presen ting two pleasant pieces for their first public per formance. They were immediately followed by the Bison Chips (Richard Pisano '82, Scott Thistle '82, Chris Brown '81 and new member Howard Hillman '84), whose performance was so well received they were called back for an encore."
"Chorale members Mark Greenawald '83, Jeff Weitzel '84 and",

Tuesday.,"It was also too bad the group could not play another piece before quitting the stage. The chorale portion of the program, though well done, was con siderably longer than that of the orchestra."

'The,
Big Red One ' is a war movie,
of strong sensitivity and deep feeling,"For those who worry about see ing an anti-war movie and prefer the excitement of continuous bat tle, don't worry. The Big Red One is filled with realistic seat- gripper battle scenes -- Panzer attacks, artillery shelling, the suspense of flushing out enemy snipers in a foggy forest, and other bizarre and eerie effects not found in the average shoot 'em up war flick. One should see The Big Red One for two reasons: to consider the effects of war on the innocent and uninitiated mind, and to ex perience some very excellent bat tle footage. Both should give the viewer something to think about over the long weekend. Photo-- Tim Hoying"

formance with the Pittsburgh Opera Company,"By DAVID O'CONNELL For those who have chosen to stay in metropolitan Lewisburg for midsemester break, the Cam pus Theatre offers Samuel Fuller's The Big Red One to start off the vacation. It closes tonight, so even if you're going home, there's one more chance to catch the film. The Big Red One is Fuller's autobiographical tale of his ex periences in a World War II rifle squad in the first infantry divi sion, whose nickname is derived from a red number one on their shoulder patches. But while the film takes the au dience through Fuller's battle ex periences in North Africa, Sicily, France, Belgium and Germany, don't expect to see an epic representation of democracy's massed march across Western Europe. Instead, be prepared to see an anti-war statement at its most effective level -- from the viewpoint of the individual. The rifle squad is transformed from a confused group thrown in to battle to a toughened fighting unit. The film concentrates on the activities and development of the group -- examining the effects of battle in microcosm. Lee Marvin turns in a perfectly cast performance as the veteran sergeant, leading Mark Hamill, Robert Carradine, Bobby Dic- cicco and Kelly Ward as the core of his squad. Carradine performs the difficult role of the nar- rator/chronicler -- Fuller's own character -- who is writing a book about his experiences. Hamill co-stars as Griff, who serves to illustrate the movie's major-themes-................. .. ......... In a role quite different from his work in the Star Wars mold of the self-styled hero, Hamill con stantly struggles to justify the difference between murder and killing. He is at the same time the unit's best rifleman and its most hesitant killer. He grows from freezing in fear on the beaches of North Africa to heroically saving his squad during Normandy's D- day landings. At the film's emo tional climax, the liberation of a concentration camp, Hamill ef fectively conveys the final transformation to a killer. Marvin also has an inner strug gle which he must resolve. The film opens with Marvin stabbing a German to death; he then finds out that the armistice ending World War I was signed four hours earlier. The sergeant is haunted by his error, and in the character's plot climax, he has a chance to rectify the mistake. The plot vehicle was an almost vignette-like collection of the squad's isolated experiences in battle. The fighting scenes were well done, lacking the usual re quisite gore and profanity which lesser directors fall on to convey realism. Fuller instead evokes real fear from the actors, and believable reactions to death and destruction. The only problem in this organization and the narrow view of events is that it is difficult to grasp an overall sense of plot movement. Although thematic development was direct and well- conveyed, it took concentration to sense continuity as the scene changed suddenly into or out of battle, to a different time of year, or to a different country."

Volleyball splits 2,"By LISA CERUTI The volleyball team split a pair of home matches last weekend, losing 3-0 to Gettysburg Friday but sweeping Lehigh 3-0 Saturday. Gettysburg ended the Bisons' three match "" beaten streak by outplaying Bucknell in all three games during a 15-6, 15-13,15-u victory. According to Coach Terrie Grieb, the spikers put up a fight in the last two games but team play was lacking. "" Nobody had a good game. If we could have identified the specific problem, it could have been corrected."" She added, "" The team didn't play all week and was sort of stale when it came to the game on Friday."" The Bisons' had been idle since a victory over Lafayette Oct. 11. Serving was a major problem against the Bullets as approx imately 12 serves were faulty, Grieb said. Bucknell regrouped Saturday with a 15-1,15-13,15-12 victory over Lehigh. Grieb stated, "" The entire team played well against the Engineers and captain Susan Bairstow '81 "" had her best match of the season."" The coach added, "" We lost to Lehigh last year (2-1) and we were really up for a win."" Grieb noted, "" The serving was much improv ed and the play in general was definitely better.""  The victory upped the Bisons' record to 5-8. The junior varsity suffered the same fate as the varsity, losing to Gettysburg 9-15, 11-15 and beating Lehigh 15-5, 15-4. Grieb com mended freshman Janet Rankin's "" excellent serving' and sophomore Carol Schmidt's "" all-round good game. The volleyball team has already won more games this year than all of last when they had a 3-11 record. On their way to a 5-8 mark the Bisons have beaten both Lehigh and Lafayette, two squads that defeated them last season. The Bisons' next match is at Shippensburg Friday, their first of four straight road matches. The teams did not meet last season. The spikers do not have another home game until Oct. 29 when they host Wilkes College. _______ ____ _______ _ ________________________"
Field hockey gains 1 -1 tie on,
last-minute goal versus ETown,"By JAN BALAKIAN Sophomore Maria Procopio's goal with 30 seconds remaining gave the field hockey team a 1-1 draw at Elizabethtown Monday. The Bisons won their third game of the season Saturday with a 1-0 blanking of Lehigh at home. The stickers now sport a 3-6-1 record and still have a chance to qualify for the EA1AW Cham pionships November 6-8 with four games remaining. The Bisons' play in the tie with Elizabethtown (7-2-2) was "" sporadic"" according to coach Sally Starr. "" At times we had good passing and teamwork but then we would enter the doldrums."" The Blue Hens, 3-0 winners over the Bisons last year, opened the scoring midway through the second half before Procopio's marker gave the Bisons their first tie of the campaign. Jeanne Minahan '83 had an "" excellent""  game at link ac cording to Starr. "" She kept the ball on attack and played a very good defensive game,"" the coach said. Goaltender Betsy Doyle '82 "" made some good stops and suc ceeded in taking the pressure off us,"" added Starr. After a scoreless first half against Lehigh, the Bisons pro ceeded to play "" intense, concen trated hockey"" in the second half, Starr said. Nancy Dill '84 scored the mat ch's lone goal in the second half on an assist from co-captain Anne Kennedy '81. The coach noted, "" We got the goal and were able to maintain the ball on attack and our intensi ty didn't let them score."" Starr praised the play of the en tire forward line of Dill, Pro- copio, Chrissy King '82, Sue Lenker '84 and Becky Bittinger '84. The coach remarked, "" King played her best game of the season.

Steve Bigotto '82 (25) and tri-captain Jim O'Shea '82 (33) race through the middle section of the,
IC4A Championship Division meet Monday. The Orange and Blue harriers earned their most,
significant victory to date by outracing 20 other teams.,"""This proves to the rest of the country what we have. ' ' These were coach Art Gulden's remarks after his cross country team outraced an outstanding 21- team field on their way to the 1C4A Championship Division title Monday in New York. The Bisons, ranked 16th in the nation before the meet, placed six runners among the top 22 racers to finish first with 55 points, spoil ing pre-race favorite Villanova's bid for a third straight team title. Tri-captain Jim O'Shea '81 called the race ""our best team per formance ever."" Gulden commented, ""We didn't seem to be awed by the highly competitive field. We really believed we could win."" The har riers gained additional incentive when they read a race preview in the New Y ork Times that failed to even mention Bucknell as con tenders. 12th-ranked Villanova, their lineup stocked with world class foreign athletes, managed 79 points for second. Boston Univer sity and George Washington University were distant third and fourth finishers with 173 and 177 points, respectively. Equally as amazing as the squad's team finish was the third Reifsnyder was the first American runner to finish (the first two were Kenyans) and his time of 24 minutes, 14 seconds over the five-mile Van Cortlandt Park course set a freshman record. Reifsnyder broke the mark of Mark Centrowitz, the 5,000 meter champion in the U.S. Olympic trials this summer, who ran a 24:21 time for Manhattan in the 1973IC4A meet. Reifsnyder said, ""I didn't feel any pressure before the race be ing only a freshman,"" and added ""I was really pleased with my performance."" Solomon Chebor of Farleigh Dickinson, the fourth place finisher in last year's meet, won the race in 24:11. Amos Korir of Villanova captured second place in 24:13, just one stride ahead of Reifsnyder. Villanova's Sidney Maree, the world renowned run ner from Kenya and the winner of the race in both 1978 and 1979, struggled to a 21st place effort. The individual achievements of the reaming varsity harriers can not be overemphasized since depth once again provided the triumph. The Bisons' second through sixth runners finished only 13 places and 14 seconds apart, and the combined time of the first five Bucknell runners broke the course record. Steve Bigotto '82 kept up with the leaders for most of the race and eventually finished ninth in 24:50. Rick Sayre '82 nosed out O'Shea for 12th place by running 24:56. Tri-captain Sayre noted ""It was nice being underdogs,"" ad ding, ""coaches from rival con ference teams were yelling for us even though they had teams entered."" Tri-captain O'Shea stated, ""I probably ran the best race I've ever run"" in notching 13th spot in 24:57. Mark Hulme '83 completed the Bisons' scoring by running 25 minutes flat for 18th position. Freshman Jeff Hines was four seconds back in 22nd and Glenn Gibney '83 finished 41st in 25:28 as the final member of the team. tice run on the course Sunday. The junior varsity harriers outraced 30 opponents to win the J.V. race with 26 points. Rutgers trailed far behind with 54 as the Bisons swept the top two posi tions. Jerry Jurick '84 placed first in 25:39 and Doug Pickell '82 follow ed eight seconds later in second place. Tom Richardson '84, Rick Coffin '82 and Dave Hawes '84 completed the scoring by placing fourth, eighth and 10th, respec tively."

The Bullets are not expected to be very strong so the Bisons ""will run a strategic race,"" ac cording to Debraggio. ""We'll pro bably go out quick and then settle down and run a good fast time."" The large East Field crowd groaned as chance after chance went for naught during the second 10 minute overtime session. The Bisons were on the verge of their fourth straight loss when co-captain Bruce Marcey '81 lined up for an indirect free kick with 40 seconds remaining in the contest. Marcey lofted a shot toward a crowd of players in front of the Rider net and the ball was lost from sight for a moment. Suddenly, John Krupka '81 got his foot on the ball and sent a shot home to give the Bisons their second tie against two wins and four losses. Goaltender Pete Puccia '81 remarked.. ""The goal turned our season from a disappointing one to a potentially promising one."" In the first half, the Bisons ""moved the ball well"" according to coach Craig Reynolds but couldn't put the ball in the net and settled for a scoreless draw at the end of the first 45 minutes. The second half proved different as Rider started to take control. Rider tallied the first goal by converting on a fast counter attack mid way through the half. Soon after, Brian Hassinger '81 directed a picture-perfect header past the Rider netminder off a cross from sophomore Doug Hitchner to tie the contest. Rider controlled the tempo in both overtime sessions but the Bisons received the break they needed to avoid another defeat. The hooters travel to Lafayette Saturday for an important match with the Leopards. The Bisons have a chance to win the ECC West con ference title with victories in their remaining conference m atches against Lafayette, Delaware and Lehigh. The contest features a matchup between the two top scorers in the western division. Lafayette's George Tiger is the point leader with four goals and three assists through the Leopards' first nine games while Mark Brother- ton '83 has five goals and an assist in eight games.

Polo wins BU tourney,
on score in last second,"Photos --Carl Jonsen Above, Tom Butler '82 (right) battles a New York Athletic Club defender for possession during Sunday's championship of the eight-team Bucknell Tournament. Butler's alley oop pass to Scott Schulte '81 (below center) resulted in the decisive goal the 6-5 Bison triumph, By JEFF CROSS The New York Athletic Club had battled back from 4-2 and 5-4 deficits to tie the Bucknell 'A' water polo squad 5-5 with under three minutes remaining in the championship game of the Bucknell Tournament Sunday morning. The NY AC knew a tie would give the championship trophy to the Bisons since there is no over time play under AAU rules and they trailed Bucknell by nine in goal differential, the deciding factor in case of a tie. Although the Bisons were assured of first place unless they surrendered a sixth goal, pride was at stake. Last year, Bucknell edged the NY AC 3-2 in the Bucknell Tournament final and rallied in the final minute for a 4-4 draw in the AAU Nationals. Both teams had waltzed to the fin als with decisive victories over four opponents. The Bisons crushed Cornell 15-2, Richmond 13-4, the Philadelphia Aquatic Club 19-4 and Slippery Rock 144 in in the semifinals. The NY AC trounced Navy 13-6, Bucknell 'B' 18-2, Slippery Rock 10 - 5 , and Cornell 11-1 in the semis. Goaltender Tony Paxton '81 commented, ""We knew we had to play extremely well to win."" At this point, however, play grew cautious and neither team was able to mount enough pressure to score the decisive tal ly. As the clock ticked down to less than one minute remaining, the voiciferous capacity crowd in F r e a s - R o o k e  pool grew noticeably tense. With three seconds remaining, the Bisons had time for one final scoring thrust as they were awarded possession in their own zone on a penalty. Tom Butler '82 lobbed the ball in the direction of captain Scott Schulte '81 who cut behind defenseman Homer Lane and in front of the NY AC goal. Butler said, ""Scott was driving for the net and I just tried to hit him with a pass. It wasn't a set play."" Schulte, the Bisons' leading scorer who had been effectively marked throughout the match, timed his move perfectly as he rose out of the water and tapped Butler's pass over the head of the NY AC goaltender and into the top of the cage. The clock showed only one se cond left as the crowd leaped to its feet in a frenzied roar. The Bucknell players mobbed one another in a scene reminiscent of the United States Olympic hockey team's celebration after their win over the USSR in the Lake P lacid Olympics in February. The Bisons survived another nail-biter against the NY AC, perennially one of the major challengers to Bucknell's East Coast water polo supremacy. The NY AC broke the ice early in the first quarter of the title match by scoring on a six on five penalty situation. However, Bucknell evened the game when Dan Inglefield '82 was credited with a goal put in by one of the NY AC's own players. Mark Gensheimer '81 scored on an assist from Peter Weiman '81 to put the Bisons ahead 2-1 mid way through the second quarter but late in the half, New York retied the contest by putting a re bound by goalie Paxton. The fast paced action continued in the third quarter with numerous scoring chances for both squads. Bucknell broke the deadlock when Marc Corl '81 tallied on an assist from Gensheimer on the first shot of the quarter and the Bisons went up by two when Weiman converted on Gen- sheimer's cross pool pass. Weiman commented, ""We should have had them beaten there but we let them come back."" New York dominated the latter part of the quarter and scored two goals to tie the action going into the final seven minutes. The Bisons stunned the NY AC early in the fourth quarter and by moving in front 54 when Weiman scored his second goal on another Gensheimer assist. New York again battled back, tying the contest by scoring when Bucknell's defense became brief ly disorganized. The stage was set for Schulte's memorable goal and the Bisons had their 16th victory in 17 outings. The keys to victory according to Schulte were ""not making mistakes, playing a well balanc ed game and being as physical to them as they were to us."" Gen sheimer remarked, ""Intensity was our biggest asset."" Schulte, a second team All- American selection last year, See GOAL, page 14"
Gridders amass 31 points in gaining fourth victory,"m * A. _ _ l_ _ 1 n A Inn J  4 a IVlA l A a I t AT* * A By STEVEN SKOLNICK and MICHAEL SUAREZ The Bisons defeated the Golden Rams of West Chester 3l-2l Saturday behind the stellar offensive performance of left halfback Ken Jenkins '82. In amassing 34l total offensive yards, Jenkins rushed for 146 yards in 23 carries, returned punts and kickoffs for 87 more, and caught three touchdown passes for an additional 108. The teams were deadlocked with three points each at the end of the first quarter after trading 30- yard field goals. On the first play of the second quarter, sophomore quarterback Al Locey, standing on his own 26, pumped a 44-yard pass to Jenkins who gathered the ball in and sprinted the remaining 30 yards to paydirt. Senior Alvin Depew's conversion put the Herd in front to stay, 10-3. The Bison offense was soon back in control as out side linebacker Jeff Miller '82 intercepted a Ron Gaynor aerial on West Chester's 3l-yard line. Jenkins and Marshall Hall '83 pushed the ball down to the one-yard line where Locey, on a keeper to the left, tallied the Bisons' second touchdown of the afternoon. Depew's point after touchdown in creased Bucknell's advantage to 17-3. The game looked as if it might turn into a Bucknell romp, but with 40 seconds left in the half Gaynor and his favorite receiver, Bruce Carthon, combined for a 12-yard scoring play. Gaynor was sacked attempting a two-point con- version and the Bisons took a 17-9 lead to the locker room. - On their second possession of the third quarter, the Bison offense, starting from its own 45-yard line, drove down to the West Chester ll behind the rushing tandem of Jenkins and Hall. On the next play, Locey rolled out to his left and as the Ram defensive unit closed in, lofted a pass to Jenkins on the right side. Jenkins barreled over two defenders on his way to his second touchdown of the game. The Herd went out in front 24-9 when Depew s con version split the uprights. The Golden Rams were unable to retaliate as the Bison defense frustrated their scoring efforts throughout the third quarter. Early in the fourth quarter, though, West Chester trimmed the Bucknell lead to 24-15 when Gaynor found the end zone on an eight-yard bootleg to the right. Again, the Rams' attempted two point con version failed. The Bisons responded similarly as Locey and Jenkins combined for their third score, a 23-yard pop pass over the middle, advancing the Herd's lead to3l-l5. . ,, The scoring was finalized at 3l-2l when Gaynor hit Carthon with a 6l-yard aerial on the next series. Head Coach Bob Curtis, commenting on the slip pery field and poor officiating, stated, ""There were a lot of uncontrollable factors that went against us. I was pleased to get the win.""

Fall break dates kept by most,"_ _____ _ _ _  . .  . n  1 A <<T n.nfi nn Avnammanf dl nart of thP By MATT KARANIAN Most students appear to have honored the scheduled dates for last week's fall break, neither leaving school early nor returning late. This is the conclusion reached through informal observations by Dean of Student Affairs John Dunlop and Dean of the College of Engineering Barry Maxwell. Dunlop said "" no issue""  has been made of student absenteeism immediately preceding or following the break. He had received "" no complaints"" about persons leaving early, "" and therefore suspected student attendance was not irregular,"" he said. "" I've seen or heard nothing to indicate students have abused the privilege,""  Dunlop said. Maxwell concurred with Dunlop's observations saying there did not seem to be a "" significant dif ference"" in class attendance in the days before the break. He said students "" probably made an attempt not to abuse""  the midsemester break dates, since the break was an experimental part of the academic calendar. If the break "" gets abused like the Thanksgiving vacation,""  Maxwell said, there would be "" no sense continuing it."" On the Friday before the four-day rest period, the number of students eating lunch in the University Center cafeteria was considerably lower than the normal count for Fridays, according to Dining Ser vice Director Henry Ross. He said the breakfast count on that day was "" a little more than normal,"" however. Ross said between 800 and 1,000 people normally eat breakfast on Fridays, but that the count was 1,250 Oct. 24. The increased number of breakfasts served may have been a result of plans by many students to leave for heme sometime after that meal and before lunch, Ross said. Normal student meal attendance resumed the See ATTENDANCE. Page 4 By DAVID HAWKINGS Debate on a mandatory general education program for students in the College of Arts and Sciences has begun after a semester's postponement. The proposal for a mandatory January course for credit is still under consideration. With the plan by the Cur riculum Committee of the college now in its fourth year of deliber ation and revision, committee Chairman Jackson Hill told the Arts and Sciences faculty Oct. 29 that the draft now before them was the group's "" final attempt"" at a compromise pleasing to all factions of the faculty. But after two 80-minute meetings on that date and Tues day, the approximately 70 voting faculty members at each session had failed to vote on even the first point of a 13-point proposal. The vote on the first element of the latest general education package -- which would mandate a foreign language requirement i- of two courses through the 102 level -- was stalled at both meetings by various amend- * ments, parliamentary wrangling and arguments over how to han dle the length of the debate. Other parts of the current general education proposal in c l ude a r e q u i r e m e n t in m a t h e m a t i c s  o r l o g i c , humanities, social sciences and 'the natural s c i e n ce s.  A "" capstone"" course would be re quired of students in their senior year, and a "" common ex perience"" would also be man dated. The program would supercede the current scheme of distribu tion requirements for students in the college and a "" College Coun cil"" would be established to in stitute and sustain all the other requirements if passed by the Arts and Sciences Faculty. Three alternatives for this "" common experience""  are listed in the proposal, two of which call for a credit course in January of either Freshman or Sophomore year. Such a course would require the approval of the entire Univer sity faculty if it is first passed by 1 the college faculty, because of the Jan Plan's status as a program for the entire University. But the "" common experience"" section of the current proposal is far down on the agenda, and as yet has no scheduled date for debate in the College of Arts and C p i A f | i >> A G A mandatory "" Jan Plan"" was approved by a two-vote majority of the University faculty at their February meeting, but the vote was later discarded on a technicality. Discussion of the proposal was later tabled in definitely by that body. At the Oct. 29 meeting, an alter- See DEBATE, page 4"
Disturbed local man,
is caught after spree,"By TRICIA KENNEDY Campus Security officers joined East Buffalo Township Police in the apprehension of an "" obviously disturbed"" Lewisburg man here Friday, according to reports filed by Assistant Chief of Security Michael Amarante. Donald Wise, Jr., 25, of RD 5, Lewisburg, was detained for acts of disorderly conduct, trespassing and disturbing the peace following a series of incidents here in which Wise had exhibited irrational behavior, police said. Wise was identified as having a history of mental health problems. He had been released from a mental institution six months ago. At 4:50 p.m. Friday, Amarante was notified by radio that a man had been observed tearing the wallpaper from the walls of the Univer sity Center and was then in front of the building. Amarante responded to the call along with Chief of Security Norman Fine and the East Buf falo police. , Wise threw a container of coffee at Amarante as he approached, the officer said. Wise then fled across Moore Avenue and into the park ing lot, where he began banging the rooftops of cars and yelling obscenities. .. . . .. He proceeded toward Davis Gymnasium, discarding his clothes as he ran. The pursuing officers followed Wise into the gym, where he was subdued and handcuffed, according to police. Wise had been detained by Amarante for disorderly conduct in the Bison Oct. 29 and again in the Olin Science building the following day. No charges were filed against Wise. He was taken to Geisinger Medical Center in Danville where he is being held for evaluation as the result of a petition signed by a Union County Mental Health Depart ment official."

Reagan 9s electoral win buries president,"By MATT KARAN IAN WASHINGTON--There was a feeling of euphoria here Tuesday as party faithfuls gathered at the Hilton Hotel for an "" Election Night Watch""  spon sored by the Republican National Committee. Amid cries of "" We did it! We did it!""  it became clear early in the evening that the GOP was registering victories in contests nationwide for its House and Senate candidates, as well as a presiden tial victory for Ronald Reagan. RNC chairman Bill Brock addressed the mass of Reagan supporters in the International Ballroom of the hotel several times during the evening. Billing the night as a "" new beginning,"" Brock called on supporters to "" make the victory something that will last for a lifetime."" "" We have done the first part of the job but we have much left to do,"" he said. Brock had warned the crowd earlier that because "" several thousand"" were waiting at the doors to get into the ballroom, "" at the moment no one can get in and no one can get out."" Hotel officials estimated there were 14,000 per sons in the hotel, and that more than 6,500 persons had packed the International Ballroom to watch as election returns were reported on the giant screens in the hall. The ballroom is designed to accommodate 4,000 persons and was filled over capacity by more than 50 percent. Hilton Conference Coordinator Barbara Hipp reported the "" fire marshall closed the hotel at 10:30 p.m."" because of the overcrowding. The New Year's Eve atmosphere of the evening began early and lasted through the night. By 8:30 By DAVID O'CONNELL Riding on the coattails of Ronald Reagan's sweeping electoral college vic tory, the Republican party made major gains on the national and state level as voters called for a new conservatism at the polls Tuesday. Reagan's electoral landslide of 489 votes to President Carter's 49 was backed by a GOP gain of 12 Senate seats, giving them control by a 53 to 46 margin over the Democrats. In addition, the Republicans gained four governorships for a total of 23. In the first GOP controlled Senate since 1954, Howard Baker of Tennessee is ex pected to become the new majority leader. In major power shifts, Strom Thurmond of South Carolina is in line for the chair manship of the Judiciary Committee -- now held by Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts -- and Barry Goldwater of Arizona will replace the defeated Birch Bayh (D -- Ind.) as chairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence. Powerful Democrats who lost reelection bids included Bayh, John Culver of Iowa, George McGovern of South Dakota, Frank Church of Idaho and Warren Magnuson of Washington. In Pennsylvania, Phila delphia Republican Arlen Specter defeated Democrat Pete Flaherty by a 52 to 48 percent margin. The Democrats maintained control of the House of Representatives by 243 to 192, although the GOP gained 32 seats. When the 97th Congress convenes in January, it will be the first time that one party has not"
CAMPAIGN,
UPDATE,"controlled both houses of Congress since 1916, and women will hold a record 21 seats in the House. Opinion pollsters defended their predic tions for a close race by saying that most major polls stopped just as a Reagan popularity surge began late last week. They were reluctant to extrapolate late Reagan percentage gains into a landslide in the interests of statistical conservatism. Republicans picked up more than 200 legislative seats around the country, in cluding control in key states such as Penn sylvania and Ohio. The importance of statehouse control will be heightened after the 1980 census results are released and the legislatures vote on redistricting. p.m. the mood in the hotel had turned from one of nervous anticipation to one of jubilous celebration. It was recognized that Reagan had won the elec tion and it was not long before speakers addressing the ballroom crowd here spoke of "" president-elect"" Reagan. The hoopla of the night included mocking farewell salutes to President Carter and the singing of "" Bye Bye Jimmy"" to the tune of "" Bye Bye Blackbird."" Carter's announced concern with his daughter Amy's worry of "" nuclear proliferation"" was a widespread joke of the evening, with hundreds of lapels sporting "" Ask Amy""  buttons. A running tally on Republican victories was kept by RNC officials, who announced favorable out comes as they became known. The defeats of Democratic Senators Birch Bayh of Indiana and Frank Church of Idaho were met with great fanfare. Senator George McGovern's loss was greeted with mild astonishment as a dream-come-true to some, and added to the snowballing momentum of excitement for the evening. McGovern's talk to the nation on television was met with a spattering of boos from the ballroom crowd. In a subsequent speech to the supporters in the hall, Brock declared "" We got our country back to day.""  He said he was so happy that he felt like singing 'God Bless America.' Upon this que the band played the song, and was joined in with the singing of most of the crowd of 6,500.

"Japan exec, lectures on productivity","By CATHY NAGEL There is a difference in attitudes between Japanese and American laborers and the difference has provided for an increased rate of productivity in Japan, according to Takeo Shiina, president and chief executive officer of IBM, Japan, Ltd. Shiina spoke to a moderate sized crowd in the University Center Forum October 29 on "" Produc tivity and Management Methods"" in the United States and Japan. "" In Japan, everyone is motivated to produce quality goods. The Japanese prevent the production of possible rejects by the attitude for quality pro duction by the workers,""  Shiina said. In the United States, however, he said, "" there are stringent inspections to detect rejects."" As a result, Shiina said, "" there is a decrease in the operation rate of facilities which leads to higher costs and decreased production."" Shiina is a resident of Japan and has worked for IBM in Japan since June 1953. He started as a plant manager, and "" worked his way up"" to the position of president of the Japan based operations in 1975. He graduated from Keio University in 1951 and from Bucknell in 1953. He received mechanical engineering degrees from both universities. The most important of the reasons for Japan's in creased productivity is government measures, Shiina said. "" There, the relationship of government and industry is completely different than in the U.S. Here, government almost means your enemy."" In Japan, "" the government is one of your part ners.""  It encourages and helps industry to develop by giving good tax measures and direct subsidies to corporations, Shiina said."

"" I don't wish to be strangled by rules on this,"" Chambers said. "" The point is to have a reasonable debate."" A motion Tuesday to substitute the language requirement with a "" cultural otherness"" require ment was also defeated by voice vote after a debate lasting the majority of the hour and one- quarter debate. A sso ciate  P r o f e s s o r  of Chemistry William Scouten at tempted all afternoon Tuesday to separate students in the bachelor of sciences programs from the proposed general education re quirements, but his attempts -- one of which was a plan to vote separately on each point in the package for B.S. and B.A. students endorsed by the Cur riculum Committee as a com promise -- were all voted down. Another defeated motion -- by Professor of Education William Moore -- would have removed candidates for the bachelor of science degree from the jurisdic tion of the program entirely. The Arts and Sciences faculty will resume debate with con tinued discussion of the foreign language requirement Monday."

Amherst 'Student' publishing again,
after winning additional allocations,"The Amherst Student. which "" ceased publication"" Oct. 20, has resumed its regular printing schedule without missing an issue following an additional grant of student funds. The twice weekly newspaper of Amherst College had its request for $27,500 from the Student Alloca tions Committee halved Oct. 15, and Student Publisher Barry Volpert announced in a front page story four days later that the paper could no longer continue to print without the additional funds. But before the paper's demise could begin, the allocations committee rescued it by appropriating an additional $14,028 for operating expenses. The Student had run up a debt of $12,000 in the last year, primarily from the purchase of facilities the publisher said enabled them to print faster and "" more effectively."" When the student group's decision not to cover the debt was announced, Volpert said in an editorial that a "" free, unhindered press""  was being com promised and that the paper would therefore be forced to discontinue publication, making it "" the on ly respectable college in the country without its own student-run paper."" Other students at the school said the paper was using its position to force financial support from the appropriations group, and that they had "" sensa tionalized the issue in order to garner student sup port,"" according to another Amherst publication, In Other Words. "" The paper just blew the thing out of proportion,"" one student said in a telephone interview."

Anthony C. E. Quainton said while many of the casualties in curred in these 3,300 terrorist acts were "" trivial""  compared to those caused by other kinds of violence, they are important because of the way terrorism is performed and how it affects society in general. Speaking to a group of approx imately 150 in Coleman Theatre, Quainton said terrorists are regarded with general disap proval because their victims are often innocent people. But ter rorism is not simply "" mindless violence,"" he said -- it is a sym bolic act intended to influence politics by means of directed ag gression.

Reaction to Reagan,
election tentative,"Foreign reaction to Ronald Reagan's election was both hopeful and tentative. The Russians attributed Carter's defeat to turning from detente to heightening interna tional tensions, and to "" breaking hundreds of campaign promises to the voters."" They said U.S. - Soviet relations could be whatever Reagan wanted them to be. Western Europe cautiously hoped for moderation; the most exuberant Reagan congratula tions came from Britain's conser vative government. China, which was offended by p reviou s R eagan p olicy statements, reminded him that it was Nixon's Republican ad ministration that first initiated cordial relations with Peking."
U.S. might meet,
Iranian demands,"Carter administration officials said Wednesday that the presi dent could accept Iran's four con ditions for the release of the hostages if negotiations to settle ambiguities were to take place. Officials said it would be legal ly impossible to return all of the $8 billion in frozen Iranian assets, but that a compromise where the control of the assets would be transferred is possible. The State Department also hopes that the hostages might be released before all the demands are com pletely satisfied. President Carter's ability to comply with the Iranian s demands without the approval of Congress is being questioned due to recent legislation and constitu tional principles limiting the power to set aside private rights in pursuing foreign policy objec tives."

The Atlanta police have ex panded their special force in vestigating the killings to 35, but they have no leads in the case.

In the only other Democratic victory locally, voters returned incumbent Allen Ertel to the U.S. House of Representatives. This was expected, however. arch-conservative Ed Helfrick easily defeated Democrat John O'Brien. The county supported Ronald Reagan for president with a 66 percent plurality and Arlen Specter for senator in keep ing with their statewide victories. Voters also passed a referen dum which authorizes a switch from paper ballots to punchcards which can be counted by com puter.

Fall break: home is so different than Bucknell,"By TODD G. BUCHHOLZ Thanks to the ABS and some supportive faculty, we had a fall break before Thanksgiving. The break was supposed to begin on Friday afternoon. But who can concentrate on statistics or English when your ride is leaving in an hour? We all have priorities -- and pack ing takes precedence over professors, I guess. Coming home is always a thrill. But I think my family has adjusted to seeing me only a few times a year. This past visit caught them off guard. I was greeted by my dog Jasmine--who didn't recognize me. She growled and snarled and leaped for my jugular vein. Now I know how the paper boy feels. Mom was real hospitable too. After about five tries she got my name right. "" Oh it's, uh, Scott, no it's Jill, Jasmine, let me see your driver's license --ah, welcome home Tedd."" She adapted to my presence very quick- that had been ingrained in my mind. * or ly, though. Pretty soon I was taking out the. instance, I couldn't accept the idea of garbage, walking the dog (who still didn't eating without standing in line for an hour, remember), and driving the car to the so I asked my family to enter the kitchen store at 1 a.m. so my little brother could single file. Luckily my brother has some ticket- punching experience. Of course, dining without trays also seemed strange. And I couldn't resist the urge to group my silverware together on the left side of my plate when I was through. When I went to bed that night, I stared at the ceiling and walls of my room. Something was missing. Something cold, something with lines. I thought harder. "" Ah-hah,""  I said, "" Cinder blocks, green . .. . . . ___ . ,, cinder blocks."" How could"

A very attrac- Bucknell is so different than life at tive, alluring and seductive amenity: home. In four days I had to break habits television."
THE,
BUCH,
STOP,"Here at Bucknell, there's no time for TV. So far this year I've watched only three shows: the Johnny and Ronnie debate, the Jimmy and Ronnie debate and McHale's Navy, while I did my laundry. Obviously I like comedy. The television at home, however, has mystical powers. Magically, my desire to study economics, political science and statistics was dissolved. My desire to watch Johnny Carson and boxing was ig nited. After all, nobody knows more about politics and economics than Johnny Car- son. Recall the way he negotiated a multimillion dollar contract by threaten ing to quit -- there's social contract theory, personal income analysis and statistics combined! Sorry, professors and administrators, but for the price of watching Alpo commer cials and tolerating Ed McMahon's obse quious laugh, I can get an education. And the University wants to raise tuition $1000? I'll stick with Johnny and stay at home, even if my dog doesn't remember me."
The United States,
9limited,
spectrum99,"By RICHARD PETEREC In order to put Tuesday's elec tion in a clear and proper perspective, one must first understand the political spec trum (both absolute and relative) within which the United States operates. The diagram shows this spectrum. Every country has its own uni que political "" respectability spectrum,""  i.e., the generally ac- c e p t a b l e p h i l o s o p h i c a l parameters within which the political institutions effectively operate and which are accepted as norms for that society. For ex ample, in France, the spectrum runs from the communist left to the ultra (reactionary) right, and the political campaign is so struc tured as to effectively allow an airing of all views. The voter can, ip most case?, vote jjpsitively for a candidate of his/her choice. In the United States, however, our "" respectability spectrum"" runs from the moderate right (liberal), to the center right (conservative), to the far right (reactionary). Of course, we euphemistically refer to these three positions as liberal, moderate, and conservative -- but all three are Tightest in the absolute sense, with little to limited faith in the role of govern ment as an active regulator of our economic and social life. There is an effective void in the U.S. from the absolute center to the left, with token but ineffectual representation by the Socialist Party, the Socialist Labor Party, the Workers World Party, the Communist Party and the Socialist Workers Party. Oqr two main political parties both cover Hie spectrum from liberal to reactionary (Javits to Helms, Kennedy to Folsom), with the 1980 Democratic presidential candidate (and John Anderson) coming from the center right (conservative) and Republican Ronald Reagan from the far right (reactionary). In 1932, there was a sharp swing to the moderate right (liberal), and, until this past Tuesday, the presidential elec tions were between moderate right (liberal) and center right (conservative) candidates. The significance of Tuesday's vote was that for the first time since 1932 there was no liberal can didate running for president, there were two conservative can didates (Carter and Anderson) and one reactionary (Reagan), with the reactionary candidate winning. . , . In a period of economic uncer tainty, inflation, high unemploy ment and a resurgence of anti- U.S. feeling abroad leading to paranoia, there was a malaise and uncertainty rampant in the American electorate. The radical right joined the scared tradi tional liberals -- blue collar workers, ethnics, etc. -- and con servatives to give the election to Reagan. In terms of the three R 's of politics the voters, in a period of frustration and uncertainty, re j e c t e d  both R e f o r m and Radicalism for the Reactionary alternative. It was very reminis cent of a similar, though more ex treme, phenomenon that oc curred in Central Europe in the early 1930s. In the worst possible of scenarios, during the next four years we will witness: a) an end to detente, leading to confronta tion politics with the Soviet Union and a return to the cold war and b) a period of internal social in stability with the economically and socially disenfranchised lower 10-15 percent of our popula tion f eel i ng i nc r e a s i n g l y frustrated by the Reagan ad ministration's emasculation of much of the progressive or refor mist social and economic legisla tion developed over the past 40 to 50 years. This could lead to riots reminis cent of the 1960s and a counter demand for "" law and order,"" which in four years could lead to a further movement to the right, which would lead to . . .  see diagram!

Factions and finesse,
The push for curricular reform in the College of Arts and,
"Sciences has returned to the floor of faculty, but already it appears",
the latest compromise plan may be doomed to crumble under the,
weight of the group's factionalism and parliamentary finesse.,
The plan for a set of general education requirements within the,
"larger of the two colleges here--and the call for a "" common ex",
"perience"" course to be taken in January--is a version of the docu",
ment which has been getting steadily weaker since it was first pro,
posed almost four years ago. And as the program has been watered,
"down, the spite between the "" arts"" faculty and their colleagues in",
"the "" sciences'' has become increasingly potent.",
We obviously find disappointing and discouraging the lack of,
willingness on the part of the faculty to engage in what Dean Robert,
"Chambers calls "" reasonable debate"" on these issues. The point of",
the first two annoyingly stagnant meetings this fall seems to have,
been who could most thoroughly stump faculty parliamentarian,
"Richard Peterec; likewise, natural sciences professors tried first",
and foremost to remove their degree programs from the rubric of,
the proposed general education guidelines.,
Thorough and cooperative debate is sorely needed if the college,
is to finally take a firm step toward an appropriate educational,
"future, and we strongly encourage all faculty members to put aside",
their departmental prejudices and discuss the plan objectively. If,
"this is done, no length of discussion could be called unproductive.",
Wading into journalism,
"Two weeks ago, when the Amherst Student almost ceased",
"publication due to a lack of funds, an outraged editorial in that",
publication declared that no community can be free unless it is in,
formed.,
"On campus, the college newspaper is the lifeline of communica",
"tion between students, faculty and administration. It provides a",

Power can be a terrible thing,"To the Editor: Power is a terrible thing. It can turn an undergraduate liberal arts student into a New York Times-caliber critic who God Himself wouldn't be ashamed of checking with before attending His next movie or show. It can allow an editor to overstep his professional boundaries in an at tempt to refute a reader's com ments. More importantly, however, when it is abused, power can turn a critic into a hypocrite. I think we have all seen an excellent ex ample of this in the last two issues of the Bucknellian. dience's intelligence."" First of all, our aim in organizing Bucky's Place was not educa tional. professionals. They were just students just like you and me and I thought they did a fantastic job. If someone's intelligence was insulted, we had no qualms about their leaving so they could go back to their rooms and study. We could have used the vacated spaces to seat the 200-plus people whn had to stand. Based on the overwhelming number of positive responses that I heard both during the show and in conversations later on during the week, I was shocked to read the anonymously-written review of Bucky's Place which appeared in the October 17th issue of the Bucknellian. Secondly, I may be wrong, but from my vantage point it looked to me as though the audience did, in fact, become extremely quiet and did try to "" raise the roof six inches."" The author faulted Eagles for "" encouraging the crowd to be ex tremely quiet, then extolling them to 'raise the roof six inches' with cheers and applause.""  This apparently "" insulted the au- If sloppiness in the show was a problem, then let's consider the magnitude of the show that was presented. Bucjsy's Place provid ed five hours of entertainment which more than 2,000 people at tended. Four different acts per formed and more than 75 people were involved in the production and execution of the evening. Professionalism is a good point to end on since it seems to be a point on which we have a mis understanding. It just so happens that there is an excellent exam ple of unprofessionalism in the last issue of the Bucknellian. Get ting the last word is one thing, but placing an editor's note at the conclusion of someone's letter in order to reinforce your position and discredit the letter-writer's opinion is a farce. But, that's not the best one. The editorial enti tled "" Living with Criticism"" seemed to me to be an attempt by the editors to refute criticism that was aimed in their direction. How hypocritical can you get? I only hope you wrote that "" tongue- in-cheek."""
Brockhaus,
responds,"You just can't witness a quality show Uke the one we prrsented anywhere else--and we did it with no admission price. When you put things in perspective, we think the show came off with very few hitches indeed. To the Editor: I was somewhat taken aback -- and, if politics were not so serious,"
I,"would have been amused -- by the vehemence with which the Reagan fans at tacked me. I stated at the top of my piece that it was directed not at Ronnie's folks (since trying to talk someone out of voting for Reagan is probably like trying to talk him out of having syphilis), but at those who were thinking of voting for Anderson. These latter were strangely silent. The anonymous critic thought that the level of professionalism went down considerably after Jon Sprout's act. Well, to the best of my knowledge, the singing waiters and waitresses were not What is the upshot of this letter?--probably two things. First, I guess it means I can't take negative criticism. Second ly, however, I think it is impor tant to realize what a little bit of power (the "" power of the press"" ) can do to us. Reviews that appear in this paper are really nothing more than one person's opinion. In fact, they belong on the opin ions' page and not the arts' page. I think we should begin to realize our our qualifications and then limit our writing to that level of professionalism. It makes much more sense this way."
Not bisons,"Mike Debraggio Co-chairperson Homecoming Saturday Night Committee To the Editor: I question the validity of John Dzurinko's recent proposal that the ABS President be allowed to receive academic credit for holding that position. While rewarding the holder of this rather important and time- consuming office with academic credit would certainly be an honorable, and possibly appropriate action, I question whether such a move would establish a precedent for a drastic rise in the number of extracurricular student activities that would demand academic recognition. There are surely several students who hold extracurricular posi tions of responsibility who feel that their jobs are at least as deman ding and educational as that of the ABS President. One immediate ly thinks of the rather un-subtle barb by the Bucknellian in the arti cle about Dzurinko's proposal: Why shouldn't section editors of the Bucknellian receive academic credit? Of course they should . . . their commitment and what they learn surely warrant it. But what of other ABS officers? The managers of the radio sta tion? The BJRE directors? Student conductors of the band and chorale? Those with major positions in Cap and Dagger produc tions? Fraternity presidents? The list could go on and on, and would rapidly enter the realm of the ludicrous. Many, if not all of the students on this campus who are leaders in extracurriculars would assert that these activities make up an in- dispensible part of their college education. If the University sets a precedent of expanding academic credit to, for example, the ABS Presidency, I can foresee other student activity leaders believing that they also deserve academic recogni tion. After all, one must remember that extracurricular activities are extra-curricular; they are in addition to, not a part of, the regular academic program of the University. They are to supplement what one learns in the classroom, not replace it. There is no shortage of talented, motivated Bucknell students to fill positions in our many student-directed organizations. In fact, the large number of high-quality student-run organizations is one of the most impressive facets of Bucknell life. To grant academic credit for a few of these positions would, out of fairness, necessitate granting credit or some other form of academic recognition for all. Any thinking person should be able to visualize the Pandora's Box of problems, demands, and potential abuses that such a course of action could perpetuate. Kenneth Gaul Nov. 4,1980 I will leave it for the logicians, as an exercise, to criticize Mr. Caragher's claim that my article commits ad hominem abusive; the weight of my argument (ap parently too much for Mr. Caragher to bear) was, as I pointed out, directed not at Reagan voters but at Anderson voters. Mr. Buchholz' droll comments on politics I will also leave for others, but it is worth pointing out that I don't feel guilty for my stupid vote in 1968 but just dumb; guilt has no place in education. On second thought, I cannot resist one self-indulgent com ment on Mr. Buchholz' piece. If a vote for Reagan is a vote against government regulation (I am, in cidentally, touched by his faith in the Invisible Hand), then why is it that the Teamster's Union decid ed to back Reagan because they were angry at Carter for deregulating the trucking in dustry? Things are just not as simple as they seem in Disney land. Richard Brockhaus Assistant Professor of Philosophy Oct. 30.1980 To the Editor: Bucknell University, as Bar ron's College Catalogue states, is supposedly of a "" highly com petitive""  nature. Why, then, do we find so many items of Bucknell paraphernalia printed with the word "" Bisons"" on them, when, in fact, there exists no such word? The plural of "" Bison"" as can be found in Webster's Col legiate Dictionary, is "" Bison,"" not "" Bisons,""  just as the plural of "" sheep"" is "" sheep."" I find it sur prising that a university of Bucknell's prestige would allow such an embarrassing error to go by unnoticed. Talk about "" Romper Room R ejects.. . "" Lori Mougalian '84 Oct. 28,1980"
Don't use,
name-calling,"To the Editor: Professor Richard Brockhaus could have stopped writing his ar ticle after the second paragraph. By calling Ronald Reagan a "" senile facist,"" Brockhaus ig nored one of the fundamental rules of responsible critical writing: Don't use name-calling. Name calling produces bad blood between the writer ,and reader and serves no useful purpose whatsoever. Jim Snedeker '81 Nov. 3,1980"

Odyssey of producing a theatrical set,
combines hard work with creativity,"#w By LYNNE RUTHERFORD The Cap and Dagger production of Moliere's Tartuffe, which ran last month, owed much of its Baroque atmosphere and elegant staging to the set design of F. Elaine Williams, visiting assistant professor of theatre and English. The course of how this set was built, from William's first conceptions to the play's final performance, represents a convergence of several forms of art, in cluding painting, sketching and costume design. After receiving her appointment last spring, Williams paid a visit to Lewisburg in June to both look for an apartment and meet with Harvey Powers, director of the University Theater. "" At this time, Harvey was also formulating his ideas on the play. We spent an evening discussing our ideas and gaining a basic ap proach to Moliere,""  said Williams. The pair's initial discussion of Tartuffe brought the basic theme of the covering and uncovering of hypocrisy to the forefront. Williams underlined this theme in her set. In the beginning of the play, the stage was austere, with all the typical Baroque ornaments absent. As Tartuffe's hypocrisy was unmasked, however, servants added these ornaments and restore the earthy and dramatic nature of the period. Williams said that because it was difficult to determine when the exact plan of the set became fixed in her mind, she was open to sug gestions from her surroundings. "" The shape of a bush or a sculpture, anything that interests you, can effect the final design,""  she said. "" This set was unusual in that it contained nine different en trances. A focal point was needed for grand entrances and exits, and the top of the staircase provided it,""  she added. To prepare herself for designing Tartuffe, Williams extensively researched France during the reign of Louis XIV, particularly the castle Versailles and the court life there. After this research, Williams organized her ideas into a series of preliminary sketches, which she presented to Powers. After these were finalized, she began a floorplan and mapped her design to scale. Finally, Williams constructed a model of her set. A crew o f about 20 students then began work on Sept. 17. These students worked four to five hours per day until the week of the show, when construc tion was in progress virtually around the clock. Due to limited time and lack of crew hands, Williams was forced to modify her design slightly. "" My only regret is that the set was not as fully realized as I in tended it to be. There wasn't enough time to totally finish some details,""  she said. The Baroque period also was created in the furniture and costumes chosen. Fortunately, a table and chairs from Hunt Hall proved close in design to the period and were transported to the theater. Williams made preliminary sketches of ideal versions of all the costumes and then rented all but three of them from Brooks Van Horn, a New York costuming firm. The rest were constructed by Peg Homberger '83 and members of the costume crew. "" I was very pleased with the costumes. Generally, we were able to find clothing of the period,"" Williams said. "" The house designer (of Brooks Van Horn) allowed us to look through their stock and select the ones that came closest to my designs."" Williams said if time had been sufficient, it "" would have been fun to construct the costumes ourselves."" * After the four-day run of Tartuffe the set was dismantled, or struck, within a few hours, but Williams was not saddened by the demise of her handiwork. "" That's the nature of the theater. It was just for four performances, and each of them was different. Nothing remains the same for long,"" she said. W mME a ioto--Carl Jensen"

Professors fulfill need for expression,
through clippings on their office doors,"By LYNNE RUTHERFORD Where do your professors find creative fulfillment? Not always lecturing to 100 students, or grading essays. A stroll through the corridors of Coleman Hall, Vaughn Literature and other academic buildings yields the answer: many professors most vividly express themselves through clippings on their office doors. "" I take great pride in my door,""  said Ben Marsh, assistant pro fessor of geography. "" It's an expression of myself."" Marsh's door includes a picture of a man holding a pig. It also ap pears to be the most autobiographical. "" It's me--the boy with a dog syndrome,""  said Marsh. Generally, professors ' clippings can be divided into, three categories: those making an important personal or political state ment, those expressing likes and dislikes and those placed on the door just for fun. Included in the first category is the door of Eric Schutz, assistant professor of economics, located at 221 A Coleman Hall. On it is posted a photo of Eugene Debs, the 1912 presidential candidate who garnered more than 1 million votes on a Socialist Party ticket. "" It's to make students aware of the Socialist Party, and to ask themselves who Eugene Debs was,""  said Schutz. In common with several other professors, Schutz included a car toon denigrating T.V. "" I just hate it,"" he explained. Also attempting to make students more aware of important political issues are the clippings of Tom Travis, associate professor ofpolitical science, located at 201D Coleman. Featured prominent- ly on his door is a picture of a highly appetizing hamburger. "" It's there to make students consider their own eating habits, in contrast to the rest of the world, a third of which is starving,"" said Travis. In contrast to the more highly-minded clippings, several other professors use their doors to publicize likes and dislikes, or just to have fun. Among this group is Karl Patten, associate professor of English. His door, located in the Wilbur Smith Memorial Library, displays a sign reading "" Occupied, Occupied, Occupado."" "" It's there for the fun of it, and because I believe in language,"" said Patten. Harvey Powers, in keeping with his post of director of the Univer sity Theater, displays a poster of the Stratford Shakespearean Festival. "" Whenever a new poster comes along that I like better, I make the switch. I didn't like this year's Stratford poster, so last year's is still up,"" said Powers. Professors also appear able to poke gentle fun at themselves. The door of Elaine Williams, technical director of the theatre, posts a cartoon with the question, "" Don't you think the entire idea of sets and costumes is vulgar?"" Countless other instructors sported an array of clippings arrang ing from the simple to the bizarre. So the next time you need an in sight into how your professor's mind works, make a close examina tion of his or her door."

Craft shop provides stu<,
with a chance to learn,"By DAVID BLACKMAN Feeling uncreative lately? Lost in a world of books and blackboards? The answer to your pro blems lies hidden on the first floor of the Univer sity Center in the place on campus where students may go and create decorative and useful items in many artistic mediums. Under the direction of supervisor Molly Ross, the Craft Shop allows both the interested amateur and the experienced craftsman a place to practice his trade. A schedule of classes rang ing from quiltmaking to furniture refinishing is offered each semester and is open first to students, faculty and University employees, then to interested outsiders. Some students in the courses have come from as far away as Danville and Bloomsburg. With reasons ranging from "" I'm making a pre sent for my roommate""  to "" I'm replacing a sculpture that my mother broke,""  or simply for the pleasure and accomplishment of working with their hands, many students have been drawn to the craft shop. Some of the most popular courses at present are basketry and calligraphy, along with the always full jewelry and ceramics courses. The beginning drawing and painting course has been particularly successful, giving the shy and inex perienced artist a chance to learn basic skills.

Unique to a University Craft Shop experience is the new course in medieval brass rubbing. This traditional English art of tracing plaques onto paper has found a recent upsurge in popularity throughout the country, according to Ross. The plaques used are fascimiles of actual plaques from churches in England dating back to the thirteenth century. One former student of the shop, Bill Vander- wilt '80, learned the art of silk screening and now prints and sells his own T-shirts. In addition, fraternity and sorority members have found the wood burning kilns in the shop useful in such pledging activities as making wooden paddles. The limited space of the craft room could be seen as a hindrance to the growth of courses, but this is not the case. Organization of supplies is precise and students are required to replace and clean up all materials used. This is the only restriction placed upon them, as admission to the shop is free. With new programs added every year, the Craft Shop has so far managed to gauge the preferences of students correctly. They plan to expand even further in the future.

The art in Kung-* u,
is stressed by club,"The average person's expectations of the martial arts has been formed by Kung Fu movies: fantastic twists, lethal kicks and im possibly high jumps come quickly to mind. Yet in reality, the University's Kung Fu Club pursues an entirely different form of the martial art. ""We stress Kung Fu as an art, not a sport. Martial means war, art means creativity. We stress the artistic aspect in our teaching,"" said Vergel Blake '82, treasurer of the club. ""Movies vastly exaggerate the art. They portray Kung Fu totally differently than it is in real life,"" added Blake. Kung Fu originated in ancient China as a form of exercise. Although it is an art form, the primary function of Kung Fu re mains self-defense. A disciplined student never uses his skills unless attacked first, according to Blake. ""Kung Gu is based on the principles of love, harmony, and peace. You don't hurt anyone unless you have to,"" Blake said. The club, sporting 20 to 25 members, meets formally Tuesday and Thursday in Tustin Gym. During this time, lessons are given. In addition, two informal practice sessions are held per week. To become ranked and work toward a black sash, students must at tend at least two sessions each week. Jim O'Donnell '81 is the club teacher. The group has already held one exhibition on Parent's Weekend. They plan to perform during halftime at this year's basketball games in Davis Gymnasium, and are scheduling a special exhibi tion for second semester's Celebration of the Arts Week. Kung Fu not only develops physical discipline, but mental discipline as well, according to Blake. The club engages in medita tion before practicing Shu Chu Chaun, an improvisational form of Kung Fu devised by Leon Trescott '80, founder of the club. A syn thesis of all branches of the Martial Arts, it incorporates techniques into a shadow-boxing type of format."

Writers assembled at University,
for fourth Annual Poetry Festival,"By MARJIE GELZER Tuesday evening marked the beginning of the Universi ty's fourth Annual Poetry Festival, held each fall to both local and nationally-known poets the opportunity to present their works and to celebrate the art of poetry. The first of these gatherings took place in 1977, ac cording to Professor of English Karl Patten, one of two coordinators of the program. In January of that year, Pat ten explained, he and Professor of English Robert Taylor--the other coordinator of the festival--agreed that both students and faculty needed more exposure to poetry. To achieve this goal they became co-editors of West Branch, a twice-yearly literary magazine of poetry and fiction. When the first edition came out that fall, Patten and Taylor decided to celebrate its publishing by present ing an open reading of all the poetry in the magazine. Photo--Tim Hoying"
"Robert Mayer and Barbara Ross, both of Lewisburg,",
perform Wednesday with Metamorphosis.,"They invited the poets whose work was included in the publication to appear and the assemblage was so suc cessful that it developed into an annual event. The principal sponsor of the Bucknell Poetry Festival, Patten said, is the Committee on Poetry Readings and Special Lectures of the English department. An important part of the budget, though, comes from alumni organiza tions such as the Association for the Arts at Bucknell, and from the Pennsylvania Council on the Arts. "" We must be doing something right,""  Patten said, because the council has generously increased its contribu tion to the festival every year over the last four years. This year's festival is the most extensive one ever presented here, according to Patten, because the coor dinators wanted more than just a weekend of poetry--they "" wanted ro really celebrate."" The five-day program started Tuesday evening in the C. Willard Smith Memorial Library--where all the festival's activities are slated to be held--with a poetry reading by students. This portion of the festival was organized by the students themselves, Patten said. , "" We want to encourage their participation,""  Patten said, ' 'since the festival is especially for the students. "" Metamorphosis, a performing group from Lewisburg, gave an unusual presentation of performed poetry Wednesday evening. The company's aim, according to director Joel Gori, is to look at poetry in different ways. Metamorphosis is an improvisational group that performs mime and pantomime using poetry for narration. The performers also examine the transformation of poetry, Gori said, by completely breaking down a poem and looking at it from different angles. Thursday afternoon four faculty members--Patten, Taylor, Associate Professor of Russian and Linguistics Robert Beard and Professor of English Jack Wheatcroft-- participated in the festival by reading selections from their own poetry and fiction. The major event of this year's poetry festival is a reading at 8 p.m. tonight by 14 guest poets. Each writer has published works in West Branch and several of them"
The past versus the present:,
6Consequences of Discovery,
9,"By LYNNE RUTHERFORD Artist Anna Sofaer, discoverer of an ancient Indian calendar, will present an interdisciplinary colloquium entitled "" Consequences of Discovery: Ancient American Indian Culture in Conflict with the Present""  in Vaughan Literature Auditorium at 7:30 p.m. Monday. "" The idea for the program grew out of my scientific writing class,"" Associate Professor of English Catherine Smith, organizer of the colloquium, said. "" We've been discussing the site for three years and interest in it keeps growing."" English 201B, the Bucknell Student Lectureship Committee and the art and economics departments are sponsoring the program. The principal object of discussion will be an assembly of leaning stone slabs and carved spirals found in Chaco Canyon, New Mexico by Sofaer. Constructed by the Ansazi Indians several thousand years before the birth of Christ, the assembly acts as a primitive calendar. Sofaer, who stumbled upon the site three years ago while survey ing the canyon, will discuss both the artistic and scientific significance of the site as well as the conflict it raises in commer cial development of the canyon. There are major deposits of uranium, coal, oil and natural gas in the area. "" We're dealing with the question of the responsibility of a culture that discovers another culture's form of art,""  Smith said. The American Indian Religious Freedom Act of 1978 protects sacred In dian sites and guarantees tribal religious freedom. Sofaer is now president of the Ansazi Project, an organization devoted to preserving the canyon basin. In addition to the calendar, the canyon contains thousands of other examples of Ansazi rock art. Included among the anthropologist's finds so far in the Chaco are intricate road networks for trade and transportation, as well as fairly advanced irrigation systems. These discoveries, along with the calendar, provide evidence of a complex and culturally rich civilization. However, further development of the area's abundant natural resources threatens the exploration and understanding of the Indian culture. Lecturing with Sofaer will be Thomas Buckley, a cultural an thropologist specializing in native American culture. He will discuss the responsibility to preserve ancient cultural sites. Both speakers will present slides of the canyon and other an thropological finds."

Poetry Festival.,"have participated in the three previous festivals. The program will culminate Saturday in a full day of ac tivities, including a series of readings from West Branch, readings by the guest poets, an open reading and workshops with the visiting poets. Patten put special emphasis on the 10 a.m. workshops and encouraged writers from the campus and the com munity to bring their works for discussion. People can learn a great deal, he said, by watching the poets "" zero in on a work""  and find its strengths and weaknesses. The annual poetry festival is important to other univer sities, as well as to Bucknell, Patten concluded. "" We don't know of any other campuses that do these things,""  he said. "" Since it's in the fall we like to think of the event as a harvesting festival--one in which everyone shares a rich, abundant crop of poetry."""

Chapel Choir is singing a new tune,
as McGahan conducts restructuring,"By ROBIN MEREDITH After 18 months of internal turmoil and tem porary foundering, a new Chapel Choir is rising under the leadership of Visiting Assistant Professor of Music Christopher McGahan. The Chapel Choir now numbers 26 members--a marked increase from the 17 person group inherited from Professor of Music William McRae who directed the ensemble from the 1940's until his retirement in 1979. McGahan called the past year and a half "" a transition period""  during which he has transformed the choir from a "" schizophrenic group that didn't know where it was going""  into one able "" to provide service music of the best possible kind for the University chapel."" "" People become used to the old way,""  Steve Kushner '82, the group's manager, said. "" It's just human nature that they find it hard to adjust. ' ' Many people who were not satisfied with the choir under McRae's direction rejoined the group last year, according to McGahan. Most of them were seniors, though, which left this year's choir made up almost entirely of freshmen. There has been a tremendous turnover of choir members since the group came under the new director. McGahan is of the opinion that this signifies the demise of an old image, and the plant ing of seeds for a new group with incentive and "" a sense of striving for cogent musical goals."" McGahan said he hoped interest would "" spread like mustard seed,""  although he added that bigger is better only if all members are interested in work ing hard toward "" the sense of community that is at the heart of musical experience."" The Chapel Choir, according to McGahan, is mov ing in a positive direction and looks to bigger and better years ahead. "" We haven't died,""  he said. "" We're just experiencing a period of transition--rebuilding a true Chapel Choir."""

Photographers aim,
for a new approach,"Joseph Ruszkiewicz '82, acting head of the Photography Club, has changed the club to make it more educational than it has been in the past. Ruszkiewicz said he saw pro blems because the club has been used mainly as a darkroom facili ty and, although some people were learning from them, others kept repeating the same mistakes. Levels of darkroom proficiency, he said, were not in creasing at an appropriate pace. The problem was caused by a lack of instruction, according to Ruszkiewicz. In an effort to cor rect the discrepancy, he began of fering advice to those using the room. This informal lecturing led to the planning of a January Pro g r a m  to be  t a u g h t  by Ruszkiewicz and Tom Hayowyk, a senior at Fairfield University in Fairfield, Conn. The Jan Plan will cover  all a r e a s  of photography -- from such basics as how to hold a camera, to film developing and tips on improving the quality of a print. The cost of the program will be $60-65. Ruszkiewicz said he hopes that because of his educational pro gram, there will be a higher caliber of student photography at the University. He said his future goals include at least one exhibit next semester and perhaps a photography contest in the spring."

D U  captures intramural soccer,"By LEE LEWIS This fall's intramural soccer season was characterized by close games and exceptional talent, a trend which continued throughout the playoffs to culminate in a thrilling final game. The outcome of the championship game was a surprise to many, but was well earned and proved a fitting ending to an exciting fall. When the season began Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity was the favorite to win the season title and the playoff crown. Led by many former junior varsity soccer players, Phi Psi breezed through their first five games with little or no problem. It was the sixth game of the season which provid ed the only tarnish on Phi Psi's record. A hard fought 1-1 tie with Delta Upsilon Fraternity foreshadowed a tough future battle for those two teams. After the tie, Phi Psi won their last three games to enter the playoffs as the number one seed. They sur vived a scare against Kress Underground when they trailed 1-0 with 10 minutes to go before rallying to win 4-1. Then came the semifinal game against the Shadow II, one of the preseason favorites to reach the finals. Playing with only nine players, the Shadow, led by goalie Chris Petermann '81, gave Phi Psi all it could handle before falling 2-1. DU had a tougher time during the regular season, struggling at first, but rounding together toward the end of the campaign. Buoyed by quick goalie Stu Berger '81 and leading scorer Tom Wilkins '82, DU edged Kappa Sigma and Phi Gamma Delta Frater nities and the Shadow early in the year. Hard fought ties with Kappa Delta Rho Fraternity, Harry's Bar and Grill and the aforementioned game with Phi Psi were the only blemishes on DU's record. DU had an easy task in the first round of the playoffs, outclassing the Endless Knights 4-0. The semifinals didn't prove as easy, however, as DU battled KDR for the right to enter the finals. The regulation time ended with a 0-0 deadlock, and since neither team tallied during the two overtime periods, the outcome came down to penalty kicks. In the darkness and cold of late afternoon on Oct. 29, DU outshot KDR 4-2 to win the game. Before an estimated 200 people Friday, the two top teams of the intramural soccer season battled it out to see who would capture the championship. Throughout the first half both teams played defensively, not wanting to make a fatal mistake. The only real scoring opportunity came when Phi Psi goalie Oscar Crews '83 attempted to cut off a long DU pass intended for Wilkins. Wilkins beat Crews to the ball, but his shot rolled just wide and the first half ended in a scoreless tie. As the second half developed, Phi Psi started to take control, led by intramural all-stars Jim Kingman '81, Bob Dalton '80, and John Colligan '80. Phi Psi peppered the DU goal, but fine defensive play by all-star John Zaharchuk '81 and superior goaltending by Berger prevented any scores. About 10 minutes into the second half, DU got the big break of the game which provided the margin of victory. Winger Larry Esposito '82 took a clearing pass at midfield and led Wilkins with a pass up the middle. Wilkins dodged junior fullback Rich Brooks, and was able to get around goalie Crews and push the ball between the posts at 34:21 of the game. At that point, DU sat back on defense and tenaciously held the lead. Steadied by Zaharchuk, Berger and Bill Evans '81, DU managed to reject all of Phi Psi's bids to tie the game, and clinched a 1-0 victory."

Bucknell closed the regular season at 8-6-1, with a 6-0-1 ledger over the past seven games. The strong performance in the final half of the season has earned the squad a second seed in the AIAW Division II Regional Tournament at Loyola College in Baltimore this weekend.

The winning goal was scored by Jeannie Minahan '83, her third tally of the season, on a penalty stroke. On Oct. 29, the squad gained its seventh victory with a 2-0 blank ing of Wilkes. The Bisons dominated the action, out- shooting Wilkes 16-5. Bucknell goal scorers were junior co-captain Anne Kennedy and Maria Procopio '83. Kennedy has four goals this fall and Pro- copio three. Earlier in the week, the squad benefitted from a tie-breaking goal by Nancy Dill '84 with 9:30 left in the game to defeat Pitts burgh 2-1. The goal was Dill's sec ond of the game and sixth of the season, a team high. The Bisons outshot Pitt 16-14 and goalie Betsy Doyle '82 registered nine saves."

Lehigh crushes Bisons 13-0 as fumbles prove costly,"_ ________________ __ . , ot kio nnm oiliiqf H line tn Inc>> hi<< In an attemnt to imnrnve the of- spore, a 39-vard field goal, a ByERICHOERNER BETHLEHEM, Pa. -  If the gridiron had been dry, the foot ball game between Bucknell and Lehigh two Saturdays ago prob ably would have been an offen sive battle. The nationally third-ranked (Division I-AA) Engineers came into the game as the sixth-ranked passing team in the nation in their division and had the East's top passing combination in quarterback Larry Michalski and split end Mark Yeager. The Bisons offense featured Ken Jenkins '82 as the nation's leading all-purpose runner. - However, except for the final five minutes, the game was played in a steady rain with gusting winds. The horrendous playing conditions caused the game to be a defensive struggle and Lehigh sloshed its way to a 13-0 triumph to stay unbeaten at 5-0-2. The Bison defense turned in a fine performance in holding the potent Engineer offense (averag ing 380 yards per game) to only 198 yards total. Defensive tackle Peter Mauritz '81 earned Honorable Mention as ECAC I-AA Defensive Player of the Week for his efforts while defensive back McKinley Norris '81 limited Yeager to only one reception. Offensively, the Bison's prob lem was holding onto the ball. Lehigh's hard-hitting defense and the wet conditions combined to force Bucknell to fumble 11 times, eight of which they lost. Bucknell began the afternoon by losing the coin toss for the seventh consecutive week; however Lehigh elected to kick off. On the first play from scrim mage, A1 Locey '83 recovered his own fumble for a 3-yard gain. Ken Durr '82 punted two plays later to begin a kicking contest which lasted the rest of the quarter. The Bisons fumbled four times in the second quarter and two of the miscues led to scores by the Engineers. First, Jenkins hobbled the ball at his own 26-yard line to lose his first of four fumbles. However, no damage was done as the defense held. On the next series, the Herd ran one play before Jenkins fumbled again. This time Lehigh drove to the 1-yard line, but the defense nabbed Lehigh halfback Ed God- bolt for a loss on third down, and the Engineers had to settle for a Ted Iobst field goal to open the scoring. The gridders lost the next two fumbles inside their own 15-yard line. While the first Engineer possession ended with a missed field goal, the second resulted in the only touchdown of the game. With 15 seconds remaining in the half, Michalski lofted a pass toward Yeager in the endzone. Norris went for the interception but slightly misjudged the ball as it passed over his fingertips and Yeager had his ninth score of the year to up the count to 10-0. The weather improved slightly during halftime, but the third quarter was another punting duel. In an attempt to improve the of fense, Head Coach Bob Curtis replaced Locey at the helm with Ed Hughes '83. Except for a 50-yard comple tion to Dave Kucera '84, Hughes also had problems moving the of fense. A Hughes fumble at the Bison 38-yard line led to Lehigh's final score, a 39-yard field goal, and the Herd's two-game winning streak was ended in the mud. The Bisons could generate only 166 yards of total offense. The Engineer defense and the sloppy field limited Jenkins to 55 rushing and 135 all-purpose yards, well below his respective per game averages of 131 and 210 yards."

amassing 5 TD 's,"From VICTORY, page 20 line on their first series. A short Dowdell punt gave the Herd possession on the midfield stripe. The Herd kept the ball on the ground and on a third-and-three situation from the Big Red seven- yard line, Jenkins burst through a gap in the line to cross the goal line for his second score. Depew's point after put Bucknell ahead 26- 10 . The Bisons gained excellent field position for the second time in the quarter when inside linebacker Durr snared a Mike Ryan aerial and returned it 10 yards to the Cornell 42. The running of Jenkins and Zenda and a Hughes pass to Rich Passerotti '82 brought the Herd to the Cornell five where Jenkins took it in for his third touchdown of the day and 13th of the year. Depew's conversion upped the score to 33-10. Cornell found the end zone once more on a 1-yard Bob Muha run in the middle of the fourth quarter to finalize the scoring at 33-16. However, the excitement was not complete as Bison fans knew a history-making feat was soon to occur. With a first-and-ten situation from the Cornell 26, Hughes handed off to Jenkins who burst through a hole created by the right side of the offensive line. When the Big Red defense pulled Jenkins down he had gained the three yards needed to give him 1,000 yards for the season. It was a feat not seen in Memorial Stadium since 1951 when Brad Meyers and Burt Talmage both ran for over 1,000 yards. Jenkins is only 70 yards away from shattering the single season rushing record of 1,069 yards set by Myers in 1951. Jenkins earned Honorable Mention ECAC I-AA Offensive Player of the Week honors for his performance. The five touchdown offensive performance prompted Head Coach Bob Curtis to comment, "" The backfield is solidified."" Hughes, recovered from a recurring knee injury, started his first game this year as the Bison field captain. Curtis remarked, "" Eddie had the confidence that he could get in there and get the job done. He showed potential."" Curtis continued, "" Our offense and special teams had to come through because our defense has not been up to par. Both of those phases came through."" 1 """

Herd rolls over Big,
Red behind J enkins,"By STEVEN SKOLNICK and MICHAEL SUAREZ Junior halfback Ken Jenkins rushed for 158 yards and three touchdowns in 25 car ries as the Bisons defeated Cornell 33-16 Saturday. After taking the opening kickoff, at their 20-yard line, the Bisons wasted little time in getting the offensive machine in high gear. Bucknell pushed the ball to their own 34-yard line where it first appeared the drive was going to falter. With the Big Red defense shifted into a seven-man front for the third-and-one situation, quarterback Ed Hughes '83 pit ched the ball to Jenkins. As his backfield partner, Steve Zenda '83, knocked the Cor nell comerback down, Jenkins exploded around the right end and streaked down the sideline on a 64-yard scoring sprint. Senior Alvin Depew's conversion at tempt failed and the scoreboard showed a 6-0 Herd lead with less than four minutes elapsed. "" The boys up front did a helluva job,"" said Jenkins. "" The holes open up and I get through them. We work like a well-tuned machine."" When Cornell took the ensuing kickoff and drove inside the Bucknell 15-yard line, it looked as if the game might turn into a scoring battle. However, their drive came up short and the Big Red had to settle for a 24-yard field goal by Ron Rejda that cut the Bucknell edge to 6-3. Neither team showed any offensive zest in the second quarter until Ken Durr '82 set up the Herd by booming a 70-yard punt that rolled dead on the Cornell 6. The Herd defense stuffed Cornell for three plays to force a punt. Dave Kucera '84 took Scott Dowdell's punt on the Bucknell 46, starting moving towards the right sideline and when Ed Stark '82 threw a block to spring him free for a moment, Kucera was off on a 27-yard return. Three plays later Hughes rolled out to his left, then cut back when he spotted a seam and scampered through the middle of the Cornell defense for a 20-yard touchdown jaunt. The Bison offense could only rest for two minutes as the stalwart defense again stymied the Big Red in four plays. This time, however, Dowdell never got the punt away as Jenkins buried him when Dowdell hobbled the snap from center. Jenkins and Marshall Hall '83 moved the Bisons down to the 1-yard line where Hall vaulted over a pile on second-and-goal to hit paydirt. Hughes' pass to Jenkins for a two-point conversion failed and Bucknell was out in front 19-3 with 4:41 left in the half. Cornell countered with a 72-yard touchdown drive on the next series. Fullback Ben Tenuta carried for 63 of the yards on three carries including a 16-yard touchdown run. The conversion closed the score to 19-10 but neither team was able to score again before the half ended. Bucknell gained excellent field position in the third quarter as their point stopping crew kept Cornell inside their own 30-yard See VICTORY, page 19"

He was referring to the fifth place finish his team recorded at the AAU In door Championships held last Friday through Sunday at Brown University in Providence, R.I. In "" easily the most competitive tournament we've been in all year""  according to Russell, the Bisons were seeded second and riding an 18-game winning streak.

The Bisons played seven games in three days, a pace that cost them dear ly in their matches with the established water polo powers entered.

The Bisons jumped to a 5-2 lead hv "" mitswimminc them badlv"" according to goaltender Tony Paxton '81. However, Malibu began to "" counter on our counter attack""  noted Paxton, and by converting on four of five breakaways and one penalty shot, tied the contest as time ran down. Dave Myers then won the game for Malibu with less than 30 seconds left by firing home an outside shot. Paxton remarked, "" He has an awesome shot -- one of the best in the country.""

This time, the NY AC scored twice on rebounds in the last minute to earn a tie. Paxton commented, "" It was a very disappointing game. We seemed to let down at the end."" Russell added, "" Each time we were ahead, we made key mistakes -- mistakes due to fatigue -- and lost those leads."" Chances to move into the final four were gone. Last year, the Bisons finished second in the same tournament, losing only to Pepperdine by 12-6 in the final. The Bisons had to come right back with a game Saturday night against Brown, an Eastern power the squad had edged 6-5 in the opening game of the Brown Tour nament Sept. 26. On this occa sion, though, the result was not as close as Bucknell rolled to an 11-5 triumph. The weekend odyssey con tinued Sunday morning with a 12- 4 victory over Fordham, one of the top teams in the East and win ners of the Mid-Atlantic League championship last season. The final game of the tourna ment Sunday afternoon pitted Bucknell against Loyola of Chicago for fifth place. The Bisons scored a 9-5 win over Loyola to capture fifth place in the NCAA Championships last November in Long Beach, Ca. The Bisons fell behind by 3-0 despite "" totally controlling the game,""  according to Paxton. "" We were so exhausted that we couldn't get anything on our shots -- about six of them hit posts."" Yet, the Bisons battled back to eventually draw even at 3-3 on two goals by Schulte and one from Gensheimer. Bucknell even had a chance to win the game with 10 seconds remaining but Schulte's shot hit the post. After seeing his team's high aspirations dashed by lack of depth and some tough luck, Russell nonetheless was far from disappointed. "" The kids gave it everything they had,""  he said. Paxton noted, "" We were close but we just couldn't put those games away. We know we're bet ter than a lot of those teams."" Industry Hills knocked off Malibu to win the championship Sunday. Schulte, who scored 35 goals in the seven games, was named AAU All-American for the second straight year. He was the only collegian chosen for the 11-player team. Receiving honorable mention on the All-American squad were Gensheimer, who scored 13 goals and 15 assists, and Paxton, who had 57 saves while allowing only 28 goals against outstanding com petition. Gensheimer was also an honorable mention choice a year ago. The Bisons take their 23-2-2 record to the MAL champion ships this weekend at Fordham. L ast' season, Fordham upset Bucknell 9-8 with a goal with 40 seconds remaining to capture first place. Fordham is the only team ex pected to challenge the water polo squad for the title. The Bisons need to finish in the top two to qualify for the Eastern Championships at Syracuse Nov. 14-15."

"$1,115 tuition hike proposed",
Increase,
a n ^ T s To 15H%,
more,"By MADELON HENEHAN The latest in a series of proposals for an increase in tuition and fees called for a $1,115 hike. The details of the proposal were released Friday. According to this fifth proposal for the 1981-82 school year, comprehensive charges would increase 15.23 percent. A fifteen percent wage and salary increase is also allotted. If this proposal is approved, the comprehensive cost for one year here would be $8,436. This version, dated Nov. 4, was discuss ed at a meeting of the Finance Committee of the Board of Trustees on Nov. 7. At this meeting the current budget was reviewed and guidelines for the upcoming budget were discussed. "" We didn't attempt to arrive at a specific decision,""  Vice-Chairman of the Finance Committee of the Board of Trustees, Andrew Mathieson, said. One item that was "" agreed upon by all parties was that we should never allow the scholarship portion (financial aid) to decrease as the cost of Bucknell in creases,"" Mathieson said. A $950 tuition increase, a $65 room fee hike and a $100 rise in board fees is the breakdown of the $1,115 comprehensive charge hike proposed. "" This is by no means a final copy of the budget. It could go up, it could go down,"" according to Chairman of the ABS Finance Committee Richard Pisano '82. The four previous proposals show a possible hike range of $879, as listed in the second pro posal, to the most recent and drastic in crease of $1,115. According to Vice President for Ad ministration and Finance, John Zeller, the probable range of increase is now "" a minimum of $900 to a maximum of $1,115."" Zeller said he "" doubts very much"" that there will be a tuition and fees hike of more than $1,115 Whether an increase of this extent will cause a drop in enrollment is "" always a cause of concern,""  Zeller said. The committee assumes other colleges will increase fees by a similar amount. Ac cording to Zeller, it is estimated that other colleges in Bucknell' s "" fram e of reference""  will go up approximately $1,000, "" with a leeway of a few hundred dollars."" "" As long as the University's fees are not out of line with other schools and family ability to pay, no problems should arise,"" Zeller said. The budget will take the "" wisdom of job""  to balance said Mathieson. One obstacle in determining it is the unpredic table rate of inflation and the degree of emphasis that must be placed on it. "" Inflation should not be used blindly, but as one of a number of factors,"" according to Mathieson. Speculating on an estimated 10 percent"
ANDREW AAATHIESON,"inflation rate, Pisano estimated next year's Freshmen would be paying $13,000 for their education here for their Senior year. Another budget determination concerns wage and salary increase. Stated in Plann ing and Budget committee member John See TUITION, page 4."

W "" r tT p .is e n t to the compos community and to the argot com- munity, progressivism as a political orientation. It s going to be lef tist ranging from radical to leftist liberal. See LEFTIST, page 4 By GREG HAHN The largest capital giving cam paign in Bucknell history is in the planning stages, according to University President Dennis O'Brien. A drive to collect $30-50 million is scheduled to begin in either 1982 or 1983, and reach maturity in 1987. The five to six year quest to in crease the University endowment will consist of a "" broad scale, general campaign"" directed toward "" alumni primarily""  and also toward "" friends of the University, major foundations and corporations,""  O'Brien said. Allocations have yet to be made for the gifts the University ex pects to receive. A "" principle amount of funds will be used for the central academic purposes of the University--for academic facilities, for endowment,' for pro fessorships and for scholar ships,""  O'Brien said. Although additional space for the library ranks as the highest priority for University projects now, O'Brien said any new pro jects would depend upon the "" availability of funds and on the desires of the major sources of the funds."" Lower down on the priority list for improvements to the Univer sity's physical plant are major improvements to facilities for the sciences and the arts. About 50 percent of the money raised is expected to go toward capital improvements, with the other half being used for strengthening the endowment, in creasing the number of endowed professorships and supporting other academic programs. The plan for raising the money was first officially discussed at a meeting of the University Board of Trustees in May, but the amount and the campaign have been in the earliest planning stages since the Sports/Recrea- tion Center fundraising was con cluded in the fall of 1978. Vice President for University Relations John Ferguson took his 12-man staff on a "" planning retreat"" Oct. 23 and 24 in State College as part of the "" early, pre planning stages of the cam paign,"" Ferguson said. Funding for the two-day, $800 conference called by the new vice president came from sources out side the University's budget, Ferguson said. According to O'Brien, the cam paign's maturity date of 1987 was chosen because 100 years earlier, in 1887, the name Bucknell was chosen for the institution former ly known as the University at Lewisburg."

-- tte --,"space. -- ------- *--j--  ***## PThe statement said a completed third floor could draw revenue for the University, and this revenue could help pay some of the expense of construction. "" Income producing""  is seen as an integral part of the proposal, and would result from use of the rooms on the floor by outside groups. O'Brien, who is on University business in Califor nia until Sunday, was unavailable for comment. The plans for use of the space -  p n p m j g  <<!e ABS Student Life Committee -- stress the flexible use"" of the space to meet both student and Umversi- tyThe proposal calls for the largest of the available areas of the floor to become a "" commons area, with a small kitchen. It is proposed this area sup plement and complement""  the cafeteria. The space could be used to serve special menus or to accommodate students with "" fast passes, the report said. It could also operate as a reception or party area for large groups. The room in which the Center Gallery art exhibit is currently housed should become a casual reading, and conversation area to supplement Wall Lounge, according to the proposal. The area facing Moore Avenue, on the uphill sia , A northern room facing Moore Avenue on the downhill side may be employed as a seminar and conference area, or as a classroom with the remain ing space separated by movable partitions to suit different groups. ' ,, The ability to accommodate "" outside groups was a major factor in determining the plans for the third floor. The University is ""much sought after as a conference location, and conferences here have generated "" over $400 thousand""  in revenues fdegr the University this year, according to the ABS report. One of the reasons for the timing of Tuesday s proposal for the vacant third floor is the upcoming Board of Trustees' meeting in New York City Dec. 6-7 The ABS approval of the plans make them a for mal suggestion to the trustees from the students. The UC third floor has remained unfinished since the building was constructed in 1970. Vice President for Administration and Finance John Zeller said a "" lack of funds""  has prevented the completion of construction on the floor. The ABS said in its statement to O'Brien however, that the "" funds required to complete the floor will be far less than amounts needed for new construc tion."" By DAVID HAWKINGS Amid cries of "" Let's just vote one part through""  and after a walkout by six voting faculty members, the College of Arts and Sciences Monday tentatively ap proved a foreign language re quirement for all future students in that college. But although the 57 members still present at the end of the meeting in the University Center Forum gave approval to the re quirement 28-23, the mandate will not go into effect as presently written unless the faculty later votes to accept the entire plan for general education submitted by the college curriculum commit- tee. The approved section of the committee's plan -- the first part of a 13-part package of curricular reform -- would require all undergraduates to have profi ciency in a foreign language through the 102 course level. Students would be able to "" test out""  of the requirement with a score in the upper 400s on the Educational Testing Services achievement tests, however. Two amendments by Chairman and P ro fe sso r of M odern Languages Allan Grundstrom that would have raised the level of the language requirement by two course numbers failed 30-23. The language requirement por tion of the plan was the first to be voted on by the faculty, but the vote was not taken until the clos ing moments of another 80- minute debate filled with anger, frustration, spontaneous fili bustering and a long list of amendments. The most significant amend ment of the afternoon -- and the only one to pass on the floor -- was proposed by Associate Pro fessor of English John Murphy and stipulates that the faculty debate the merits of each of the 13 points, vote on them tentatively and then consider the package as the whole. The amendment also called for"
ROBERT CHAMBERS,"the consideration of the so-called "" Tarpy-Chambers""  proposal, an alternative plan for general education requirements by Pro fessor of Psychology Roger Tar- py and College of Arts and Sciences Dean Robert Chambers. The plan is a modification of a plan rejected by the curriculum committee in 1977. After both plans are con sidered, the Murphy amendment calls for choosing one or rejecting both. The Tarpy-Chambers plan has no language requirement, not does it have a component for a m a n d a t o r y c o u r s e f o r underclassmen in January, and is considered by many to be a more loosely constructed ap proach to curricular reform. Chambers said in an interview Thursday that the "" more open- ended way of approaching the same values""  than the curricular committee's plan was the Tarpy- Chambers' principal advantage, but he also acknowledged that the looseness of the structure might appease many of the faculty in the sciences and education who are trying to defeat the current plan on the grounds that it is too constricting to their highly struc tured curricula."

Muchler said he could not give a specific number. The University does not provide mailing privileges for personal mail as a fringe benefit, Muchler said. . .

Muchler also reminded University employees to refra n from unauthorized use of copying equipment. He said prepared to reimburse the University for the costs of duplicating, use Sf the machine should be reserved for official University business. The abuse of the copying machines and postage metering has not been "" widespread,"" however, according to Muchler. Photo-- Megan Young"

By MARC ELLIOTT The first meeting of the newly- formed Bucknell Progressive Caucus was held Oct. 30 at Taylor Street House. A standing-room- only crowd of nearly fifty students and faculty members was present to meet the group's founders and learn something of the organization's structure. Andy Brody '81, a co-founder of the BPC, acted as "" facilitator"" for the meeting. The BPC has no president; the term "" facilitator"" is borrowed from the anti-nuclear activists, and denotes that person who sets the agenda and runs the meetings. Eric Schutz, Assistant Pro fessor of Economics, another co founder of the BPC, explained the group's development from its in ception under the guidance of Steven Stamos, Associate Pro fessor of Economics, who is on leave from the University. The other founding members of the BPC--Charles Sackrey, assistant professor of economics, Karl Pat ten, professor of English; Jim Castle '81, Thomas Trimble '82--each spoke briefly. An informal discussion follow ed, covering a wide range of con troversial issues, from employee unionization and curricular reform at the University to inter national political issues. Student and faculty input was en thusiastic and geared toward fin ding a practical way to imple ment progressive activism on campus. Former ABS president Phil An drews '81, called for a "" two pronged approach of action and education,"" and suggested the group petition the ABS to gain recognition as a sanctioned University organization. The "" working statement"" of the BPC states that the organiza tion "" will work for economic justice, political freedom, equal rights, self determination for all peoples and a reversal of the ever-increasing trend towards militarism."" late"

PACKARD,"and the Black Student' s Alliance."" Working in conjunction with the Central Committee for Cons cientious Objectors is also a possibility, "" given our anti militaristic stance,"" he said. Schutz said he believes the ris ing tide of conservatism will be a primary factor in determining the caucus' activities. "" One thing common to the BPC is an anxiety about what the Reagan ad ministration is going to mean to us,"" he said. To address this con cern, a teach-in is being planned, with panel discussions and debates being considered as addi tional activities. The BPC will also seek to become active in the processes of curriculum requirements and admissions at Bucknell,"" Schutz said. The origins of the BPC are rooted in the Citizen's Party Jan Plan which Professor of Economics Steven Stamos spon sors. It was then, said Schutz that the establishment of a pro gressive group at Bucknell was first discussed, by a small group of students and faculty. "" For a semester, nothing came of it, however,"" he said. In September Schutz gave a presentation of the Citizen's Party at a meeting of the Economic Society, and "" a great deal of discussion ensued."" "" At this point, the idea of a pro gressive caucus was translated to reality,"" Schutz said."
Steep tuition hike plan,"From TUITION, page 1. A n d e r s o n ' s "" S u g g e s t e d Framework for Budget Decisions -- A Working Paper,"" the average faculty salary is $23,040. According to Zeller, a number of professionals "" could leave and double their salaries. They are earning substantially less than students taking their first job,"" he said. Before the final budgetary decision is made in late January, at least two more meetings will be held. A finance committee meeting is scheduled for Dec. 5 which will prepare members to go before the Board of Trustees on Dec. 6. According to a University "" frame of reference list"" which compares the comprehensive in creases in tuition and fees of what the University considers to be "" similar"" schools, the proposed Bucknell increase does not ap pear to be far out of line. The comprehensive increase in fees for the academic year 1979- 80 to 1980-81 for Swarthmore Col lege was $1,513. Wesleyan University increased its fees by $1,340 and Franklin and Marshall University went up $570. Bucknell increased its fees by only $660 that year, however."

I,"By DAVID O'CONNELL The appointment oi Ronald Laszewski as director of financial aid in October 1979 has resulted in a clarification of aid policies and increased efficiency of opera tions, according to Provost Wendell Smith. "" T h ere h as been som e misunderstanding of older aid policies due to changes in the of fice and its policies,""  Smith said. "" In the past year these policies have been clarified, counseling has been increased, and record keeping has been improved,""  he added. The provost's office has direct responsibility for the financial aid program. The Board ^ of Trustees, the Admissions office, and the faculty committee on Financial Aid share in the policy making. "" Financial aid is now being discussed in a more specific man ner,""  Laszewski said. "" We try to identify the problems of connec ting the most needy students with available money in the most effi cient way,""  he said. Laszewski, who previously served as assistant director of financial aid at Vassar College, said he concentrates on data more than expressions of pure philosophy. He said that Bucknell has "" traditionally had an insuffi cient aid program overall,""  and that it will take time to make im provements. Historically, the University has aided an average of 50 percent of the admitted freshmen who were judged to be in need. According to Laszewski, the competition has been doing better. Schools such as Colgate, Lafayette and Lehigh are able to offer aid to 70 to 80 percent of those who need it. Smith said that the Universi ty's priority is to aid as many qualified applicants as possible. "" Unfortunately, we can't say that the ability to attend is not based on the ability to pay, as some Ivy League schools can,"" he said."

Laszewski em phasized fair treatment, where two students in similar positions could expect to receive similar aid packages. He said the office was suc cessful in meeting these needs, but was 20 percent low in their estimate of how many needed aid "" Inflation and increased de mand has made it impossible to continue the policy of aiding all needy incoming freshmen, Laszewski said. "" We'll have to ask everyone for more self-help aid, such as loans and employ ment,""  he added. In determining the amount of aid available, Laszewski said he must manage the flow of federal funds to needy students, direct scholarship assistance from the University, and self help sources."
is slowly making improvements.,"The total annual amount spent on financial aid here approaches $3.8 million. Laszewski said he is worried that a tighter aid market that demands standardization in distribution will result in changes that may hurt those who were gaining before. "" When people are selected for admissions, financial aid is used as an enticement,""  he said. "" I have to coordin ate which students actually get the money, which means I must ask ques tions when too many athletes or females or whatever interest are asking for aid."" - "" When you see what has to ne called an inequality among students, that bothers m e,"" Laszewski said. "" Whenever money is spent on one type of per son, be it athletes or vocalists, many others must lose out."" Laszewski's changes in finan cial aid management in the in creasingly complex market have apparently not offended a great number of students, according to Smith. His office has dealt with ten cases this year, which Smith said was "" normal."" "" This doesn't indicate that only 10 people are dissatisfied with the changes in the financial aid struc ture,"" Smith said. "" It just im dicates how many have com plained about it."" Smith said that Laszewski's changes are now in the review stage, in order to maintain a con tinuity in aid philosophy. He said that once federal policy changes and an assessment of the com petition are com pleted, a "" philosophy of some type will be f o r m u l a t e d l a t e r in the semester."""

"Prison officials, NAACP",
still at odds in dispute,"By LYNNE RUTHERFORD Lewisburg Prison Officials have apparently refused to reinstate privileges to the prison's chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. On Sept. 8, Warden J. Petrovsky denied the inmate's chapter of the NAACP access to outside members for six months. Petrovsky con tended that the chapter, by permitting outside members to lead their meetings, was violating prison regulations that required all inmate groups to be self-governing. The action prompted protests from Leroy Mobley, national director of the NAACP prison program, founder of the Lewisburg chapter of the NAACP, and also of the Lewisburg Prison Project, a local volunteer organization dedicated to the safeguarding of prisoner's rights"

Central American guest speakers present their views on American foreign policy there Thurs-,"the case would be brought for review within a month. If the chapter was found to be in compliance with prison regulations, their privileges would be restored. Mobley, who pledged to continue protesting the move until the chapter's rights were reinstated, has failed in his efforts to bring the matter to the attention of the Bureau of Prisons in Washington. The NAACP has also failed to contact the Lewisburg Prison Project for further assistance on the matter. Kinney said the action was taken because the NAACP was interfer ing with and setting goals for the chapter, and refusing to let the in mates "" do their own thing."" Prison officials have refused to cite specific instances of NAACP in terference, however."

He said the country is divided between the old order and the new reac tionary and revolutionary forces. Brown said the old order's power is diminishing because of Cuban suppression and rising oil prices, but that a new en com passing power has not emerged. He said instead of the U.S. imposing its own views in Central America, they should opt for a peaceful and democratic change. Central America is divided into democratic, totalitarian, and authoritarian regimes, according to an interpretation by Enrique Altomirano. He presented an analysis of the U.S. presence in Central America to be like "" an elephant in a boat, if it moves it's a bother and if it doesn't move it's a bother."" Altomirano said change was not inevitable, however, and that it was brought about by external, and not inter nal, forces. He said the Carter Administra tion was one that tried to change traditional patterns and support local reforms. He said he hopes the Reagan Administration will be more realistic and helpful to Central America. The final two speakers, M ichael Barry and Jam es Harney, held contradictory views on U.S. policy in El Salvador. Barry said the U.S. is trying to in volve more people in the El Salvadorian government, and support the revolutionaries in El Salvador. Harney, speaking loudly and dramatically, said the United States' interference caused the worst repression in El Salvador since 1932. Harney said he is con vinced that the government is op posing the people and that human rights are being violated."

McGahan's statements were frighteningly inaccurate,". ___ _________ ____ u_: ______ u __ which none of them had seen for its parts, pumped much of the To the Editor : Though I am genuinely pleased that the Chapel Choir is "" moving in a positive direction,""  I found the implications of Professor Christopher McGahan's state ments in last week's Chapel Choir article on the choir's "" new tune' frighteningly inaccurate. I've been a member of the Bucknell community, and a fre quent member of the chapel con gregation for over five years; I was never a member of the Chapel Choir. From this unbiased perspective I find it necessary to clarify a few facts. Obviously, the "" group in herited from""  Dr. McRae was of substantially more ihan "" 17 members,"""
I,"recall approx imately 40. While the chapel ser vice benefits from the choir's "" provision of hymns on alter nating Sundays,""  it was unfair to neglect mention of Dr. McRae's provision of an anthem every Sunday for 32 years. Yes, a "" transition period"" is necessary, but the Chapel Choir survived replacement of Dr. McRae by Prof. Jackson Hill in 1976 and of Rev. James Gardner by Rev. James Hammerlee in 1978 during sabbatical leaves. There was no attrition, no "" schizophrenia,""  and no percep tible deficit in the growth or general direction of the choir pro gram during these transitions. Unfortunately, in the past 18 months, dedicated members of the choir found that they were honestly unable to continue as s u p p o r t i v e c o n t r ib u t i n g members of the Chapel Choir. Concerning the "" many people who were not satisfied with the choir under McRae's direction"" who "" rejoined the group last year,"" the past and present members of the choir who I queried were able to generate two names of disgruntled members who rejoined the choir last year as seniors. Yes, there has been a "" tremendous turnover of choir members...under the new direc tor,""  yet Bucknell University's Chapel Choir had always been self-regenerating."
I,"witnessed choir members successfully recruiting new enrollment through their enthusiasm and musical "" incentives"" several years ago. These choir members were not coercing new sailors for an otherwise floundering ship. Obviously, there has always been that "" sense of community that is at the heart of musical ex perience"" in the choir. In 1978, over 200 alumni returned to Bucknell for a weekend for the sole purpose of singing in a com memorative concert and service marking the 30th anniversary of William McRae's Chapel Choir. This month I witnessed a former member of the choir begin to sing a piece from the an nual choir tour of 1977 or 1978. Two other members joined in, forming a spontaneously perfect STB sound a cappella, sans direc tion, for the entirety of the piece, which none of them had seen for at least two years. Clearly, this is not the work of a "" schizophrenic group that didn't know where it was going."" They had certainly arrived. Most disturbing was the im plication that the essential sense of ensemble is being created in the chapel this year. The Chapel Choir who first ministered to me four years ago had a "" sense of striving,"" an overwhelming espirit de corps, and love. I've been involved in the performing arts for 19 years, yet I can honest ly say that I had never seen a more unified, purposeful, yet non-exclusionary group. Truly, the Chapel Choir, so much more than a mere sum of its parts, pumped much of the lifeblood of the worship at mosphere through the Chapel community for many years. Finally, the Chapel Choir shown in the photograph was not performing "" last year."" The choir, which was only partially visible, was shown singing Celebrate Life (Red & Courtney) under the direction of Dr, William McRae in the spring of 1979. McGahan was quoted, "" we haven't died.""  If there ever was a question of terminal illness, it was not during McRae's tenure behind the organ in Rooke Chapel. Barbara Ann Rudolph '80 Nov. 11,1980"
The mode of direction was unclear,
Former chapel choir,
undeservedly tainted,"To the Editor: , , .. . . . I was honestly appalled while reading last week's article about the Chapel Choir in the Bucknellian. After returning to Bucknell after a year's absence, my only memories of the choir are under Dr. McRae's direction. I have no recollection of us being a "" schizophrenic group that didn't know where it was going,"" as Christopher McGahan, Visiting Assistant Professor of Music, said. The united agreement amongst its members and its director was to' fulfill spiritual needs--our own and the Bucknell community's--by providing music to the campus. Granted, we never sounded like the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, Granted, our annual fall tours were not showings of perfection Granted, on an occasional Sunday, our anthems were lacking. But I never saw the Christian spirit, which, prevailed under Dr McRae's direction, ever diminish. I realize that criticism which comes from uninformed mouths should not matter to those who know the truth, but I feel that both the former chapel choir, and especially the former director, have been undeservedly tainted."
Dianne L. Bouvier '81,
"Nov. 9,1980","To the Editor : I would like to note a number of corrections that should be made in the article in last week's Bucknellian about the Chapel Choir. The Chapel Choir numbered upwards of 35 people when Visiting Assistant Professor of Music, Christopher McGahan inherited it from Professor of Music, William McRae, not its later lowpoint of 17 members. At that time, it was a well-formed, closely-knit group. During the "" transition period, most members did give Mr. McGahan a chance to adjust to Bucknell before they decided to drop out. If the choir was a "" schizophrenic group that didn t know where it was going,"" it was because Mr. McGahan's mode of direction was unclear. We were unsure whether we were to be singing a per formance for each Sunday's service or to provide the service with music, whether we were singing secular music or sacred music or a combination of both, and whether we should dress in formal gowns and tuxes or the traditional choir robes for per formances. The message was inconsistent. Some people, not satisfied with the choir under McRae's direction, may have rejoined the group, but a much larger contingent of people not satisfied >>with Mr. McGahan's direction have left the choir. I come to the conclusion that Mr. McGahan has matured and changed many of his attitudes since the choir enrollment is beginning to regain its previous numbers. . ,, , ,, Kirsten J.

Dzurinko clarifies the credit issue,"To the Editor: I am writing in response to Kenneth Gaul's letter to the editor in which he asserted that granting academic credit to the ABS president could lead to a "" Pandora's Box of problems, demands and potential abuses"" since it would set a precedent which would enable other student activity leaders to demand credit for their extracurricular ac tivities. According to Gaul, "" any think ing person should be able to visualize""  the dangers of such a"
Chem engineers' T-shirts criticized,xi
_,"n ju ... understanding. It is just this "" expense To the Editor . . , Suspended from the ceiling of the chemical engineering lab in Dana is a T-shirt bearing the slogan "" God Created Engineers-Arts Majors Evolved From Apes."" If you are a liberal arts major you probably have not had the pleasure of viewing this hot item. However, the creators of the T-shirt have been kind enough to give the entire student body an opportuni ty to purchase their product. Last week a flyer advertising these "" all-purpose"" shirts was sent to every Bucknell student by a group of engineering students. The obvious criticism of their action is the blanket distribution of these flyers; many arts majors and indeed some science majors found the slogan and the unrequested solicitation both unnecessary and offensive. It is striking that those who sent these forms did not sense that their words might be insulting to a large part of the student body. The T-shirt's con descending phrase is no more amusing than a "" good-natured""  ethnic slur. Both have the effect of pitting one group against another at the expense of mutual growth and understanding. It is just this "" expense"" which Bucknell must pay from such thoughtless words and action. . Instead of urging us to respect individualism and to learn from our differences, these condescending attitudes and phrases make our variant course selections appear negative. The bout for the most trying (or most technical or most scholarly...) ma jor could increase in severity until our academic differences are irreconcilable. It is this criticism of the shirt's creators which, while less obvious, is much more serious than a criticism of their impetuosity. Bucknell is not merely a college of engineermg, but also one of the arts and other sciences. As such, our community gives each student the chance to in teract with the principles and practices of many, many disciplines. If we ignore this opportunity by clouding our minds with elitest thoughts we run the risk of snob bery and a subsequent intolerance of those different from ourselves."
Laura Carmelicn 81,
"Nov. 12,1980","precedent. However, it is my opi nion, the perceived danger is a result of Ken's and others' confu sion about the proposal rather than from implications of it. I am grateful to Ken for raising this question so that I could clarify the issue. Although my efforts may have been described as attempting to give credit for student activities per se, this is not correct. Instead it is my intention to raise con sciousness about the op portunities currently available through non-traditional study curriculum which has been in ex istence for seven years at Bucknell University in hopes that student activity leaders would take advantage of this program. It was never assumed that ex tracurricular activities would serve as the sole criteria for awarding academic credit. Any non-traditional study must be in dividually proposed and nego tiated with the appropriate academic department and facul ty member. Also, the course must meet as rigorous academic stan dards as other courses or the pro posal will not be honored. Currently, this is done for the editor of the Bucknellian and L'Agenda with no guarantees that their successors will receive credit. Each semester the responsibility resides with stu dent leaders to work out an ar rangement with the sponsoring department. If a number of students can demonstrate why a proposed course which includes extracur ricular activities be granted course credit, then the traditional definition of curriculum gives way to a novel curricular ap proach. This is in the spirit of non-traditional study, and in my opinion should be encouraged as creative response to a new educa tional environment. Although Gaul feels there is not a shortage of talented, motivated students at Bucknell as proven by the numerous student-directed organizations, the ability to assure continuity within groups has been a real problem, and in many cases filling positions, especially in the ABS, has been difficult. I would argue that when crises exist in society accompanied by a shrinking job market, many students become more career conscious and unwilling to spend free time on extracurricular ac tivities. Student activities make up an indispensable part of college education. As ABS president, it is my responsibility to help assure that student activities flourish. By raising the topic of non- traditional study in relation to ex tracurricular activities, I want to encourage student leaders to take advantage of this opportunity. It is my hope that it will enrich stu dent activities to the benefit of the entire Bucknell community."

Disrespect is manifest in our words as well as actions,"1 ...................................... ' nHHrocs enmpnne in con- your ears; in the second you must demonstrate an absence ol By TODD G. BUCHHOLZ "" Everyone thinks himself well- bred,"" said Lord Shaftesbury long ago. Bucknellians surely think of themselves as well-mannered and polite. But according to in formants, this is untrue. Several crack investigators have reveal ed disturbing incidents of im propriety. For instance, classes in the Vaughan Literature Auditorium end with a bang. Students begin slamming down their desk tops in cut time (ten minutes before the hour). It sounds like part of a Sousa march. Professors like to get into the act too. They enjoy raising their voices and scream ing in time with the slamming. T h e a c o u s t i c s  o f th e Auditorium add to the effect. The slamming, banging, and scream- ing r e v e r b e r a t e  like the Lewisburg High School band at 8 a.m. practices. In the University Center, the Forum brings out the best in eti quette. No matter how in teresting the lecturer, some students must leave early to at tend another function or do schoolwork. Fine. But must they stroll out the doors walking in front of the lecturer? Here's a well-kept secret: the Forum has doors in the back for those who want to sneak out ear ly. Surprise! Professors are not exempt from these criticisms either. The disrespect we show by walking out on lectures or by slamming desk tops down is manifest in our words also. The way we address someone in con versation indicates our respect for them.

In the first case you must cover your ears; in the second you must cover your face. Neither is plea sant. The popular and vulgar "" pissed off"" is a good example. I cringe as I write the phrase. Even pro fessors use it. No one uses the ex pression while speaking to those we revere or honor, such as clergymen. Yet we freely tell each other how "" pissed off we feel."" Surely a synonym like irate, disgusted, or indignant would serve the purpose of communica tion and connote a mutual respect between speaker and listener.

These publications are written by the organization or department sometimes by the students themselves, cleared by the office and receive the University's sanction when they are sent to the printers and dispensed to students. They are also prominently displayed in the Of fice of Admissions reception area. In the interests of attracting prospective freshmen, and enhancing its prestige, does the University create an overly positive view of itself in this literature? ""I can't believe they'd print that,"" Anne Mcin- tyre '82, said of the above quote from the ""Bucknell: an Introduction"" pamphlet. ""It's not totally true."" More specific literature elicited a variety of responses from students, both positive and negative. ""Hillel hasn't forced me to do anything, but they've gotten my attention all the time,"" Jeffrey Dener '83, a student who has never participated in the organization but is still on their mailing list, said. Lack of time and heavy class schedules have prevented Dener, and many students like him, from participating more fully in Hillel. Other activities also eat away at Jewish student's time. ""They really are active and offer a lot of things,"" agreed Eric Smith '83. Such ac tivities include wine and cheese parties, roller skating trips, and study breaks in addition to the regular religious services. More active members of Hillel also support the pamphlet's claim. ""The activities we hold openly encourage new people to come. The establish ment of Martin House (Hillel's special interest residence) was important. It's a good meeting place,"" said Gail Cooper '81. Martin House was founded in 1979 and has been at the center of Hillel activities ever since. Faculty members deliver lectures at the house, and Rabbi David L. Silverman, their faculty advisor, speaks there often. The Religion Department is also offering a course for credit in modern Hebrew."

Cap and Dagger, the university's theater association, puts on five mainstage productions a year, utilizing the knowledge students gain in acting, directing, theater production and history of the theater classes.

"" It cuts down women that want careers. Why isn't the pamphlet also directed at men?"" Bet sy Duane '82, a student who has taken courses in education, said of that department's pam phlet. Duane did, however, agree with the rest of the material, which went on to tell of the securi ty of holding a teacher's certificate. ""The general feeling toward teachers is like that. But it's a misconception. Many want careers in teaching, from elementary school to being a professor. Teaching is as much of a career as anything else,"" Laura Lopez '82, an elementary education major, said. The Black Student Alliance is another student organiza tion that writes its own pamphlet. As blacks on a predominant ly white campus, these students have found the need to establish their own organization as a forum for black needs and ideas. Although most members of the organization sup ported its pamphlet's contents, several expressed disappoint ment that the BSA is not as strong as it should be. ""I disagree with the quote. We're not totally a collective group. Too many people aren't active and don't come to our meetings,"" said Vergel Blake'82 . . . . . . As with Hillel, some black students have found that other time commitments preclude their participation in BSA. In general, however, the University's pamphlets appear to be a reasonably accurate representation of what the campus can offer. Many other pamphlets, not mentioned here, exist to give important information on various departments. They don't entirely shift focus away from weak spots; they just soften the lenses a little."
Student tour guides give,
positive view of campus,
By LYNNE RUTHERFORD,"As the deadline for freshman applications draws near, more and more students can be seen leading prospective applicants around campus, investigating the various buildings as well as explaining some of the complexities of life at Bucknell. [ What sort of a picture do these student guides paint of the University? "" We don't tell our guides what to say. Obviously, they are not in the business of giving a negative view of the campus, but on the other hand, a big sales job isn't call ed for either. A person who turns cartwheels and says they love every day they spend there would do more harm than good,"" said Richard Skelton, director of ad missions. "" They ask tour guides to be honest. Sometimes I have been asked questions that | put me in a precarious position, but being honest is better than presenting a rosy pic ture that's too good to be true,"" said guide Shelli Wallis '82. Skelton said the guides selected by the admissions office are students it has found to be responsible, dependable, articulate and -- most importantly -- well informed. ""Someone who has a good general knowledge of the University and studies our fact sheet will definitely make the best tour guide,"" Skelton said. The tours, which run five times a day during the week and twice a day on weekends, include Coleman Hall, the Ellen Bertrand Library, the Olin Science and Dana Engineering Buddings, the University Center and some of the neater freshman dormitory rooms. ""I think parents who are spending eight or nine thousand dollars a year want to look at the academic, sleeping and dining facilities on campus,"" said Skelton. Eligibility requirements for guiding tours are simple. The admissions office keeps d list of all those interested in the job, and as senior guides graduate or give up the job, sophomores are inserted. The new guides then attend two tour guide meetings and are required to read both the 'Bucknell in Brief' pamphlet and the various fact sheets published by the office. They are then sent to accompany a more experienced guide during his tour before undertaking the responsibility themselves. The fact sheet includes information about the University's class sizes, stu dent/facuity ratio, financial aid practices and history. A special fact sheet on the I library is also required reading. . ,, As to the banter between prospective freshmen, their parents and the student, it depends on the individual guide. ""When students ask about the social life here, I usually tell them it s what you make it. Fraternity parties are one way to meet people, but there are many other things to do,"" said Wallis. ""There are lots of different things to do. Fraternity parties, coffeehouses, movies--it's up to them,"" said guide Laurie Kochanek'82. If several guides are available at the same time, they usually try to match themselves up with applicants according to the visitor's prospective major. If that s not possible, guides rarely venture a guess on departments they're not familiar with. ""When someone asks me a question about a department I don't know much about, I suggest that they go talk with a person involved in it, like the head of the depart ment or a professor,"" is the way Lisa Tilton '82 said she handles the situation. Perhaps the most often-asked question is the familiar refrain, "" Is this school very hard7"" ""Again, I'm honest with them. Not only is it hard to get into Bucknell, it's hard to stay in,"" said Wallis. Wm"

According to Jay Cresswell '81, the FM program director, the idea of expanding the station's air time began shortly after Spring Break last semester as a means of enhancing WVBU's image. The object, Cresswell stated, was to make the listening community -- local af- ficionados as well as Bucknell students -- more aware. One of the best things about such pro gramming according to disc jockey Scott McCleary '82, is "" it's so free-form. You can play just about anything you want."" Cresswell added, "" It makes it great for re quests."" The two said requests have been pouring in. McCleary said, "" I was surpris ed I got any requests at all, but people are very talkative at that hour."" Cresswell agreed. "" Once last year,""  he said, "" we had a record of 39 phone calls between the hours of 2:30 and 7 a.m., and just last week the phone was ringing off the hook."" Both Cresswell and McCleary said they would like to see the station increase its all-night programming to five evenings per week. "" Continuation next semester is almost given,"" Cresswell said. "" We have enough disc jockeys who really love to do this."" McCleary said that while the number of late-night listeners decreases as daylight approaches, the devotion of the audience is augmented. "" The people listening like the fact that we play their requests right away. On most other stations you have a half hour to an hour,"" he said. According to Cresswell, some of the dedicated listeners aren't to be found in the Freshman Quad, in Old Swartz, or even Bucknell West, but across the river, working the night shift in the factories of Milton. "" We even had the night stockboys at Acme in Lewisburg calling up, asking to hear "" Rated X ""  by Pat Benatar,"" said Cresswell. And McCleary relates the story of the Milton man who was constantly on the phone between 3 and 7 a.m. making re quests because "" he was so amazed they were played so quickly."" And what of the disc jockey turned night owl? How does it feel to be cooped up in the ment while the rest of the campus softly snores? "" You can't think of it that way,""  Mc Cleary said. "" You have to imagine there's an audience of 750,000 out there."" He said, however, it is "" strange to come out of a night's work and see the sun rising over PhiPsi."" Although Cresswell said no DJ has ever fallen asleep at the microphone, McCleary recalls running a show and "" thinking I was in my room with the stereo on. It wasn't until I'd let the third song play that I really thought about the fact that I was at the sta tion,""  he said. McCleary has a simple theory that might explain the motivation of a disc jockey late at night -  "" You feel good that you're being listened to,"" he concluded."

Lynne Rutherford '82 plays 24-year- old Carol who has come in search of the father she last saw 20 years ago. In her reunion with Bemie -- played by Scott Sherman '82 -- the audience sees the tensions, guilt and idealiza tions that have devoloped during the separation. The play is directed by sophomore John Braile, who directed a cocktail theater production last semester. Braile is planning to direct his first full-length play, ""Look Back in Anger"" by Conrad Aiken, next semester. ""I'm looking forward to it,"" he said. It'll be a lot of work, but after the last two jobs I think I can handle it."" Also on the schedule for the creative arts house is a resident coffeehouse.

There will be no charge for ad mittance and popcorn will be served. By AL WEAVER A quick glance at the cover gives one a good idea as to the theme of this album. The bold white star in a blue field on the front, and the red and white stripes on the back of the cover blatantly hint at the con stant references to America occuring throughout the disc. In his fifteenth solo album, Hawks and Doves, veteran singer/songwriter Neil Young deals with the good and bad points of life in the U.S.A. And he does so in his usual erratic fashion -- often brilliant, sometimes downright awful. Hawks and Doves is arranged in the same mold as Young's last studio album, Rust Never Sleeps. Side one consists of acoustic material which is uncharac teristically ineffectual, while side two re- bounds with some strong electric music. However, the electric music on side two is in no way similar to that of Rust Never Sleeps. Instead of rocking like the songs ""Powderfinger"" and ""Hey Hey My My,"" side two of Hawks and Doves swings with a genuine country music sound. Gone from Rust Never Sleeps is its crisp, clear production. Instead, Hawks and Doves is rather poorly produced. The acoustic guitars on side one sound terrible, while side two sounds crudely produced-- perhaps to accentuate the country feel Young wants to bring forth. Excellent evidence of this are the ragged background vocals of Ann Hillary O'Brien and Ben Keith. The first side kicks off rather in conspicuously with ""Little Wing, fol lowed by a seven and one-half minute saga entitled ""The Old Homestead."" Recorded originally in 1974, the song presents some interesting lyrics in spite of its banal, rambling melody. The third track, ""Lost in Space, does absolutely nothing to enhance the acoustic set. The best effort on the acoustic side is the final selection, ""Captain Kennedy."" In this ballad, Young recounts the horrors of war when he sings: ""There's water on the wood and the sails feel good.And when I get to the shore I hope that I can kill good."" Warner Brothers Neil Young, whose fifteenth album,"
"Hawks and Doves,","was released this week. Side two redeems the album to some ex tent. ""Staying Power"" is a gentle country song which quickly reminds a young fan of his popular Harvest LP. ""Coastline,"" the following number, continues in this vein. The final three songs of this side save the album from its otherwise bland sound. The first, ""Union Man,"" is a splendid parody of organized labor, with some good guitar picking and smooth fiddle playing, courtesy of Rufus Thibodeaux. ""Comin Apart at Every Nail,"" with its haunting background vocals, deals with the mount ing problems of America. The final song, title cut of the album, gives Young's final verdict on America: ""Ready to go, willing to stay and pay"
U.S.A..U.S.A.,"So my sweet love can dance another free day U.S.A., U.S.A."" Done in the classic Young style, this song ties up the album's theme and also redeems it musically to some extent. But until Young puts his sizzling electric guitar back into his music any effort of his, regardless of its lyrics, will only make the listener anxiously await his next album. t# * S K >> S ill"

For the poor college stu dent who simply wants a change of pace from institutional food there often seems to be no recourse but to dine at a cheap fast-food or pizza establishment. Now there is another choice. The Scarlet D, in Mifflinburg, lies somewhere between the elegant but expensive meal and the af fordable alternative. For the stu dent with transportation the (Scarlet D is a short 20 minute drive west on Route 45. Situated in a 19th-century hotel, the restaurant takes its name from the era of its building. "" In those days,"" owner Bill Heim explained, "" there used to be an officer who would go around checking the local bars. He'd keep tabs on the drinking habits of the locals."" If you were caught drunk too many times you were branded -- in the tradition of Hester Prynne -- with a scarlet 'D' and declared a drunkard. The small-town friendliness of those earlier days is still present at this tavem/restaurant. The waitress was unhurried and will ing to spend some time talking with a customer and explaining the menu items. Even the owner had a chance to sit and chat. The food is both affordable and plentiful. Prices range from $3.25 for the daily special to $5 for a full dinner. Wednesday's special is lasagna and the dish is served in the Italian tradition of hearty eating. A heaping portion of the meaty casserole is accompanied by two generous, flavorful slices of garlic bread and a salad that is fresher than the cat's, albeit just as unimaginative. Parmesan cheese will be furnished upon re quest and liberal sprinklings of it add to the mild lasagna. Crab Cakes, a Central Penn sylvania staple that is too often dry and overcoated, were made of thin bread coatings around a sweet, tender crabmeat filling. They were served with fried potato skins, a specialty of the "" D"" that is part crunchy potato chip and part french fry. A bowl of the restaurant's locally famous chili (.75) served to make the meal a filling one. Two pieces of homemade pie ( 80 each) put an excellent end to the dinner. The shoofly pie, although a little on the dry side, had the wet molasses bottom that makes the crumbly quality of the dish easy to take. The blueberry pie was sweet without being cloying, and had a light flavor to it that went well with the flaky crust containing it. The tab for a dinner for two -- plus two drinks -- came to a total of $13.44. An enjoyable meal far surpassing that available at Mac Donald's and much less expen sive than the Lewisburg Inn."

ARTS,
Page 17,"Steve McQueen, actor in more than 24 films, died of a heart at tack Friday in a Juarez, Mexico hospital 15 hours after under going surgery for removal of a malignant tumor. McQueen, 50, whose condition had been declared hopeless by doctors, attracted attention this fall by entering an unconven tional clinic in Baja, California in an attempt to overcome the cancer in his lungs, chest and ab dominal cavity. His controversial regimen involved receiving nutri tional supplements and animal cell injections, following special diets and going through con sciousness training. McQueen ended his formal education after ninth grade, which he spent in reform school, and held several jobs--including that of deckhand on a Greek oil tanker, lumberjack in California, oil rigger in Texas and barker for a traveling circus. He finally settled in Greenwich Village in New York City, where it was suggested by a friend that he give acting a try. McQueen came a long way from his one line debut in a Yid dish language play in 1952 to be ing one of the highest paid film stars of the 1960s and 70s. What Director Robert Wise called a "" lean and hungry look which men identify with and which arouses in women their desire to love"" brought him fame during his 22- year movie career."

Ken Jenkins '82 breaks upfield in the fourth quarter Saturday. Jenkins rushed,
21 times for 84 yards to break the University single season rushing record with,
"1,079 yards.",
BY ERIC HOERNER,"""He's the franchise,"" is what Head Coach Bob Curtis says about junior half back Ken Jenkins' contribution to the football team. Curtis claims, ""Among the division I- AA teams we play and the Ivy League teams, I don't see any better back,"" ad ding, ""He's a leader for the offense both on and off the field."" Against Colgate Saturday, Jenkins set the school record for yards gained in one season with 1,079 yards, and tied the record for touchdowns scored in a season with 14. He currently leads Division I- AA with an average of 185.4 all-purpose yards per game. offensive backs which means that the op position can't stop us by concentrating on me. Finally, he said, ""I personally know the offense better this year. The Wing-T is difficult to learn, but now I feci com fortable with it."" Looking at the season so far, Jenkins said the Brown game was the team's most important. The Bisons upset the Bruins 28-20 in the third game of the season. ""Colgate was a super game, but it was depressing to lose. It would have been our biggest win,"" he added. As for the low point of the season, Jenkins said, ""Personally, the Lehigh game was the hardest to come back from. I've been the big play man all season, but in that game I didn't do the job."" Jenkins fumbled four times and was limited to 55 yards rushing in the 13-0 loss to Lehigh on the rainy Saturday, Oct. 25. Jenkins, a graduate of The Landon School, in Bethesda, Maryland wasn't heavily recruited bv colleges "" Lehigh said I was too small. I visited Lafayette and Buckncli and decided to come here. I was impressed with Buck- nell's schedule--we play good teams week in and week out,"" he said. ""The main reason I came here was to get an education. I planned to play foot ball because I like the game, but I wasn't even sure if I could play on the college level, much less this well,"" Jenkins con tinued. A management major, Jenkins said he is ""satisfied with his education so far."" He added, ""I'm not the greatest student, but I fare well."" Jenkins attributes much of his success to his close work with offensive coordina tor Rocky Rees. ""He helped me to learn to read blocks and he always points out intricacies of the game."" He credits Curtis with helping him with the mental aspects of his game. ""Coach Curtis helps my psyche. He tells us when we don't do a good job. He lays it on the line every week, but he also knows how to instill confidence."" According to Curtis, Jenkins is a hard worker in practice. He is also diligent during the off season, lifting weights and running. Jenkins said, ""I used the Nautilus machines for two years, but now I use free weights. Free weights give me the additional bulk I need to break tackles more effectively."" Curtis agreed, commenting, ""For a kid of 175-180 pounds he has good strength --he'll punish people."" Jenkins added, ""After the season, I'll get right back to the weights and ^ I'll probably run winter and spring track."" Although Jenkins doesn't try to imitate other runners, he said, ""If there is some one I would like to run like it would be Wilbert Montgomery (of the Philadelphia Eagles). He's a slashing runner, he doesn't mind getting hit and he always bounces back."" ""Ken's keys are that he has a good feeling for where the hole will open. He has tremendous acceleration getting through it once he sees it,"" Curtis re marked. ""He's very deceptive--defensive players see him coming and figure they'll get to the right place to knock him down but they have no idea he'll shift into another gear and be past them,"" Curtis continued. Jenkins has already been contacted by several NFL teams, but he has mixed emotions about pro football. ""Right now, I'm not pro material, I need to learn more. But, hands down, I'd take a shot at it if I get the chance."" Assessing Jenkins' pro potential, Curtis said, ""In my coaching career here and at F&M, the first person I saw who was super was Billy 'White Shoes' Johnson (now playing for the Houston Oilers). I see some similarity between the two."" Although Johnson was faster, he ""wasn't as shifty and didn't have the cuts"" Jenkins has. 'Two National Football League scouts went to the Brown game to look at two of Brown's linebackers, but came away with Jenkins on their mind,"" Curtis added. Last summer Jenkins worked out with the late Harold McClinton, formerly a linebacker for the Washington Redskins. ""He told me that I have plenty of talent but that the NFL teams 'have to need you.' "" Jenkins has received praise from several opposing coaches this year. Colgate graduate assistant coach Paul D'Aloia, a 1980 Bucknell graduate and former teammate of Jenkins said, ""We played Penn State and I would rate Ken in the same class as Curt Warner (the Nittany Lions highly touted halfback). He is superior to most of the Ivy League backs we've played against because he does so many things well."" ""I have the utmost respect for him,"" said Cornell coach Bob Blackman. ""He has great acceleration, can shift gears and knows how to pick his way. Not only is he a good broken field runner, he's also tough inside."" Blackman added, ""He is as good as anybody we've played this year."" Cor nell's schedule includes all eight Ivy League schools plus Rutgers and Colgate. Looking to next year Curtis said, 'The only goal I want to set is to see him im prove, to keep on getting better."" How much better? ""I don't believe he's anywhere near his potential,"" Curtis concluded. Jenkins, however, prefers to give credit to other team members, stating, ""Break ing the records means a lot because this is the first time I've done it, but I don't take it out of context. I know the offen sive line is the only reason I've had such a good year. I don't have raw talent."" Although the Bisons are 5-4, in Jen kins' opinion, they are a very talented team. ""Other teams have had a lot of heart, but this is the best team I've played on,"" he said. Jenkins cites several reasons for the improvement over last year's 4-4-2 squad. First, Jenkins mentioned a lack <5f serious injuries to the offensive line. ""We've been able to work as a unit all season long. Like I said after the Cornell game, we're like a fine tuned machine."" A consistent backfield is a second fac tor, noted Jenkins. ""Marshall Hall, Geoff Gallo and the two quarterbacks, A1 Locey and Ed Hughes, are all effective moto--(.name aerui"

Swimming tops,"By JEANNE MINAHAN The men's swimming team opened their season in superior fashion Saturday as they set three meet records and won six of 12 events at the Lafayette Relays. Although team scores for the meet are unof ficial, the squad was easily the class of the 10 team field. The 400, 500 and 1,500-yard freestyle relay teams all set meet records while the 300-yard backstroke, 300-yard butterfly and 800-yard freestyle teams were also victorious. Team captain Pat Mitchell '81, Tim Jenkins '83 and Andy Stewart '84 set a new 1,500-yard freestyle relay mark of 14:42.9, easily surpassing the previous record of 14:56.55. Mitchell, Jenkins, Stewart and Keith Hughes '84 captured first in the 500-yard freestyle relay in 4:17.8, breaking the old mark of 4:18.9. Mitchell,"
relay records,"Jenkins, Stewart and Rich Callaghan '84 broke the old 400-yard freestyle mark en route to another first place. The 300-yard butterfly team composed of sophomores Jenkins, Tom Kane and Dave Wakely placed first with splits of 54.3, 55.4 and 54.1, respec tively. The 300-yard backstroke team of Chris Layton '81, Mark Bongiorno '83 and Doug Haverland '84 were also victorious with 55.5, 56.8 and 56.8 second splits, respectively. The 800-yard freestyle team of Mitchell (1:48.8), Stewart (1:48.8), Callaghan (1:49.23) and Dave Gassert '83 (1:50.9) was the final winning relay for the Bisons. In addition, divers Tim Critchfield '83 and Doug Edmeads '84 combined to take second place in one meter springboard diving."
3-1 loss ends season,
for field hockey,By
JEFF CROSS,""" It just wasn't our day,"" reflected field hockey coach Sally Starr. Despite earning second seed in the EAIAW Division II regional tournament last weekend, the Bisons were eliminated with a 3-1 loss to seventh seeded Drexel in the first round last Friday in Baltimore. The loss snapped a seven game unbeaten streak for the squad, which finished 8-7-1. Drexel eventually lost 4-2 to LaSalle, the top seed, in the tournament final to close at 8- 2 - 2 . Starr said "" We seemed to be prepared. I was confident,"" but added, "" We probably played one of our worst games of the year."" Co-captain Jill Henry ' 81 com m ented, "" Maybe we were too worried about the games after it--we were looking ahead too much."" Nancy Dill '84 opened the s c o r in g  by d e f le c t in g freshman Sue Lenker' s centering pass by Drexel goaltender Carole Syke in the first half. However, Drexel evened the contest in the same h a l f  and s c o r e d  tw o unanswered goals in the se cond half to move into the semifinals of the eight team tournament. The Bisons were outshot 21- 10 and had but eight corners to 16 for their opponents. Offen sively, the team's problem was being "" unable to break down their defense where they were vulnerable,"" according to Starr. The coach added, "" We weren't reacting well."" Henry summarized the disappointing result stating, "" We just didn't seem to get it together. We were basically outplayed as a team."" Dill, Lenker and Jeanne Minahan '83 "" all played well"" according to Starr. Goal- tender Betsy Doyle '82 record ed 14 saves and "" played a really good game,"" Henry commented. Despite the abrupt and disappointing exit from post season action, "" Just the fact that we were able to put on a late season surge"" was of some consolation to Starr. Henry stated, "" I'm really proud of the way we turned it around."" The key to the winning streak, which began with a 1-0 triumph over Lehigh Oct. 18, was "" the offense started mov ing better. They started pass ing well with each other and became goal hungry"" ac cording to Henry. "" The defense played well all season,"" she added."

Ruggers split in EPRU tourney,"By DAVE LIONETTE The Bucknell All-Blacks defeated the Philadelphia Medical School 19-15 in the first round of the 15-team Eastern Pennsylvania Rugby Union Championship tournament in Princeton, N.J. Saturday, but were eliminated from further ac tion with a 12-0 setback to Lehigh in their second match. The All-Blacks were assessed an obstruction penalty on the opening k ick -off against Philadelphia that set up a three point penalty kick by their op ponents. The ruggers battled right back to tie the match 3-3 on a penalty kick by Stephen Dixon '81. Philadelphia jumped in front"
fir,"by 6-3 on another penalty kick and upped their lead to 12-3 by converting on an errant All-Black pass late in the first half. The ruggers were more aggres sive as the second half opened and soon closed the gap to 12-6 on another Dixon penalty kick. After John Demas '82 set up a five-yard scrum with a 50-yard kick, the A ll-B la ck s' pack pushed Philadelphia into their own end zone where Jeff McConnell '81 pounced on a loose ball for a try. The conversion evened the match at 12-12. However, Philadelphia retook the lead at 15-12 with a penalty kick minutes later. The ruggers kept up the pressure and Steve Seals '81 exploded down the sideline to record the second try for the All-Blacks and give them a 16-15 lead. Dixon closed the scoring at 19-15 by hitting on a drop kick from 40 yards out. The All-Blacks' efforts were probably their best of the season. The pack's binding was tough, outplaying Philadelphia's pack with strong play from seniors Bill Charlton and John Lester. The backs played well with powerful running from Seals, Steve Beck '82 and Shaun Visser '84. The All-Blacks, tired and emo tionally drained after their come back triumph in the first round, fell to Lehigh 12-0 in a hard hit ting game. Lehigh managed to score two penalty kicks in the first half and recorded one try and conversion in the second to make the final 12-0. By BOB DAVIS One way to measure a team's character is its ability to bounce back after a disappointing per formance. The water polo squad demonstrated theirs with a con vincing first-place finish last weekend at the MAL Champion ship Tournament at Fordham University. The victory followed a fifth- place showing at the AAU Indoor Championships, where the Bisons came "" close but just couldn't put those games away,"" according to senior goaltender Tony Paxton. They made no mistake about the outcome this tiifie, outscoring their four opponents by a 74-34 margin. "" We played well; up to our capacity,"" commented coach Dick Russell, noting "" none of the games were in doubt."" In the opener, Mark Gen- sheimer '81 notched eight goals and an assist to lead the Bisons to a resounding 19-5 win over Cor nell. Mark Corl '81 tallied four times and Paxton turned in a fine performance in goal with eight saves. Paced by senior Scott Schulte's five goals, and an eleven-point game (including six goals) by Tom Butler '82, the Herd ham mered Army 20-9 in game two. Noted Paxton, "" We showed a lot more cohesiveness -- we got everybody into the offense."" Gen- sheimer chipped in eight points, including five assists. Commenting on the team's ability to get psyched up for a weak opponent after having d e stro y e d m any o f them previously, Paxton said, "" It's not a problem -- we do a good job with our mental attitude."" goaltending chores, yielding six goals each. Schulte led the team in scoring with seven tallies, while Gen- sheimer fired six past the "" rock"" goalie. Butler added five assists en route to the victory, which set up a showdown with a tough For dham team. The outcome was familiar in game three as the Bisons paved their way to the final by thump ing Slippery Rock 20-12. Paxton and Mike Hoffman '83 split the Fordham, the only team ex pected to challenge the squad, upset Bucknell 9-8 last year on a goal with 40 seconds remaining to cop first place in the MAC tourna ment. The Bisons got revenge this time, however, with a 15-8 vic tory. Gensheimer and Schulte led the scoring with five goals apiece as the Bisons jumped out to a 4-1 lead after one period. That was as close as Fordham would get, as the squad opened its lead to 11-6 by the end of the third frame. Fordham did manage to outshoot Bucknell 30-27, but Pax ton's 15 saves kept them at bay. Chris Layton '81 turned in an exceptional defensive per formance for Bucknell. Layton, who as eighth field player has not seen much action this season, was called upon after Dave In- glefield '82 had fouled out. The Bisons return to Fordham this weekend for the Eastern Championships. The Bisons are seeking their fourth-straight Eastern title and take the pool against Washington & Lee in the first game at9 a.m., Friday. The Bisons are top-seeded and Russell says he "" expects to win."" Paxton adds, "" We know deep down that we're better than the other teams,""  adding, "" We've beaten everyone except Loyola."" A victory in the Eastern Cham pionships will mean a trip to the NCAA Championships Nov. 28-9 in Long Beach, California. The squad finished fifth at the NCAA's in 1979."

Colgate matches last,"From FOOTBALL, page 24 On the play, Colgate freshman Rich Erenberg, running his own pass route, inadvertently knock ed down safety Jim Gush '81, preventing Gush from covering Rogers. Rogers then caught the ball on the Bucknell 35 while com ing back towards his quarter back, cut to his right to avoid defensive halfback Doug Smoot '82 who was racing over to assist Gush, and outraced Bison defenders to the goal line and set off a jubilant celebration on the visitors' sideline. Curtis said, "" It was one play that turned a super second half into a loss,""  adding, "" We deserv ed to win the ball game on our ef fort in the second half."" The Bison coach remarked of the solemn locker room after the game, "" I was at a loss for words. 12-plav. 82-yard drive. Rogers, entering the game as the 14th leading NCAA Division I- A receiver, made a one-handed grab to atone for his dropped pass when wide open in the end zone on the previous play. On their first possession of the second half, the Herd marched 80 yards in 14 plays to close the gap to 10-7 when Jenkins bolted nine yards to the left side of the end zone on third down. The touchdown was Jenkins' 14th of the season, breaking the single season mark held by both Brad Myers and Burt Talmage during the 1951 season.

into a loss.',"I don't think anything I could have said would have made any difference."" The first half belonged to the Red Raiders as they built a 10-0 lead while limiting the Herd to three first downs and 50 yards in total offense. Colgate's first points came on a 40-yard field goal from Brian Byrne midway through the first quarter. Then, with under five minutes left in the half, Schuchts lobbed an 11-yard touchdown strike to Rogers, culminating an"
Head Coach Bob Curtis,"ed with sophomore fullback Mar shall Hall's fumble. On their next possession, the gridders drove to the Colgate 15- yard line behind the running of Jenkins and Hall. The key play of the drive was a 21-yard pass com pletion from Locey to halfback Steve Zenda '83 at the Colgate 31. However, the drive stalled and Bill Grennon '82 lined up to at tempt a 32-yard field goal to tie the score. Amazingly, Grennon flubbed the kick, a mistake that later would prove fatal."
minute Bison score for victory,"Curtis observed, "" He hit it off the front of his foot and never followed through.""  The Bison mentor, in retrospect, stated, "" Possibly, we should have let Alvin (Depew '81) try it. We went for the kicker who had length."" Depew is the extra point kicker for the squad. Grennon did manage to connect on a 44-yard try en route to winning ECAC Division I-AA Rookie of the Week honors against Slippery Rock Sept. 20. After tri-captain Joe Catalano '81 broke up a Schuchts aerial to stall the next Red Raider drive, freshman Dave Kucera returned a punt 31 yards to the Bucknell 39- yard line. Only 1:46 showed on the clock as the Bisons began their final scoring thrust. On second-and- one, Kucera brought the crowd to its feet when he hauled in a Locey screen pass and battled his way to the Colgate 14 with a 37-yard gain."

Ken Durr '82 uncorks a punt in the third quarter against Col,
gate Saturday. Durr has a 37.3-yard punting average and has,
made 73 tackles at linebacker this season.,"Two plays later, Locey, who took over the Bison helm when Ed Hughes '83 injured a knee in the third quarter, overthrew Kucera in the end zone on third- and-17. This set up the aforemen tioned completion to Jenkins on fourth down that left the Bisons four yards from a seemingly miraculous come from behind victory. Although Locey connected on only three of nine passes, he directed both scoring drives and showed added confidence over earlier outings. Curtis com mented, "" A1 was extremely determined to prove himself."" Locey lost his starting spot when Hughes returned from a knee injury but, "" He came back. He showed what being a com petitor is,""  the coach said. Red R aider quarterback Schuchts passed for 305 yards on 19 completions. Curtis remarked, "" They felt they could throw the ball on us,"" but added, "" What (the Colgate coaches) were real ly saying was 'We're going to have tr ouble running on Bucknell'."" The stingy Bison defense allowed an average of 148 rushing yards per game prior to Colgate and allowed the Red Raiders only 104. Curtis concluded, "" The most important thing for (our coaches) to get across is that we've got to hang tough. We ca n ' t be destroyed by one play."" The football team closes its season at 1:30 p.m., Saturday against Boston University. For a preview, see page 23."

Freshman Andy Sayles leaps above a Lehigh defender to chest,
a high pass in the Bisons' 1-0 victory in their final home match.,
Basketball plays Friday,
against Portuguese,"By BRIAN FETTERH O FF Elizabethtown handed the soccer squad a 2-1 set- back Tuesday to close a disappointing 4-7-2 season for the Bisons. The loss was preceded by a trium phant 1-0 blanking of Lehigh last Friday in the hooters' home final game. With just under nine minutes gone at Elizabethtown Tuesday, the Bisons opened the scor ing when Brian Hassinger '83 scored on an assist to Peter Mullany '84. The goal occurred on a "" mixup between the goalie and the fullback,""  Hassinger said. "" It was a case of being in the right place at the right time,""  he added. The Bisons "" passed really well"" in the first half according to Doug Hitchner '83, but couldn't score again. E-town, highly ranked in division III, tied the contest at 34:53 of the first half when Orlando Rodriguez scored off a comer kick with goaltender Pete Puccia '81 caught out of position. The hooters "" didn't control as well""  in the second half, according to Hitchner, and eventually sur rendered the winning goal when Mike Boess knock ed in a pass from Fred Potts with only 8:36 remain ing. Hassinger observed, "" We played right with them until the last 10 minutes when they started to dominate."" Hitchner added, "" Our substitutes penetrated and got off some good shots in the clos ing minutes."" The contest against Lehigh, designated 'Universi ty Game of the Week' by the East Coast Conference prior to the season, lived up to its billing as the Bisons battled to a sweet 1-0 victory. Reynolds com mented, "" It was a controlled game and not at all lopsided.""  The Bisons outshot the Engineers 14-12. The decisive goal came 14 minutes into the action when Duncan Lee '83 chipped home a pass from Mark Brotherton '83. Brotherton, the Bisons' leading scorer this season, was selected by the referees as Player of the Game for his solid, mistake-free effort at midfield. Goaltender Puccia and Paul Green '82 each played one half and came up with big saves in one on one situations, according to Hitchner. Hassinger expressed frustration over the mediocre season, stating, "" We were in every game--we just didn't finish right.""  The squad scored more than one goal on only four occasions and four of its seven losses were by a single goal. The team will lose most of the defense including co-captains Peter Christian and Bruce Marcey, yet Hassinger is optimistic concerning next season. "" The big thing is our scoring. If we can finish our plays, we'll be tough."""
Herd to,"From BASKETBALL, page 24 fensive leader. Leslie, named to the 1980 All-ECC first team and the U.S. Basketball Writers' All- District squad, averaged 20.9 points per game last season and was the top Bison scorer in 15 of their 27 games. Providing leadership and an array of exciting offensive m oves, L eslie holds seven University basketball records. Among them are most points in a game (45) and most points in a season (564), both set last year. In addition, Leslie needs just 374 points to pass Barry as the career scoring leader. Woollum said of Leslie, "" You'll be watching one of the best basketball players in this part of the country."" . , Seniors Dave Shehadi and Paul Adkins, sophomore Jay Wright and freshman Carl Cosimano are still competing for the other backcourt spot. Woollum com mented, "" The spot will go to the guy that performs the best."" Shehadi and Adkins have both earned two varsity letters and last year averaged 6.2 and 3.2 minutes of play, respectively. Wright has played "" extremely well""  in practice game conditions according to the coach and was the playmaker on the junior var sity squad a year ago. Cosimano averaged 17 points and 12 re bounds per game as a high school senior last season. The only player assured of a starting berth in the front court is 6-foot-7 center Deb Okorodudu '82. Okorodudu had only 14 re bounds in 66 total minutes last year but is expected by the coach to do the bulk of the rebounding and serve as the outlet man to in stigate the fast break. The contest for the two forward"
Boston University,"positions is being waged by senior Mike Page, junior Paul Harrison and sophomores Craig Cody and Ray Moss. Page and Harrison saw limited action with the varsity while Cody and Moss held down spots on the 12-4 junior varsity squad last year. Realizing the inexperience in actual game situations by most team members, Woollum none theless stated, "" They're ex perienced in the sense of being around,""  and adds "" They've been working hard. They know what it takes to win."" The Bisons host the Portugese National Team in an exhibition game at 8 pm, tonight, in Davis Gym. The Portugese are on a playing tour of the East Coast and are expected to provide top notch competition. The game, played under inter national rules, will be a "" good ex perience""  for the Bisons and an "" op p ortu n ity to broaden o u rs e lv e s "" a cco rd in g to Woollum. The coach "" plans to win but also have a good look at every thing we've got."" The starting lineup will be Okorodudu at center, Page and Moss at for ward and Leslie with Shehadi at guard. Woollum warned, "" There is no indication this will be the starting lineup against Virginia (in the regular season opener Nov. 28)."" Woollum hopes the University community will support the inter national contest since con siderable efffort was expended in bringing the Portuguese team to Lewisburg. The Bison mentor would like , to see another Iron Curtain national team play an ex hibition game against the Bisons in the future, as the Yugoslavian national squad did two years ago. By ARTHUR BROCKWAY The Bisons have a chance for their best record since 1972 when they dose their 1980 season against Boston University at 1: 30 p.m. Saturday in Memorial Stadium. The Terriers are "" as good as any team on our schedule""  ac cording to Bison Head Coach Bob Curtis. Their 8-1 record includes 28-24 last-minute victory over Connecticut last Saturday to clinch the Yankee Conference ti tle with a 5-0 record. The Bisons were crushed 38-7 by UConn in their season opener Oct. Sept. 13 in Storrs. Davidson, the teams' other common opponent, de feated the Bisons 21-13 Oct. 4 in Davidson but lost to the Terriers 35-14 Oct. 14 in Boston. Boston University battled back from a 17-6 halftime deficit to tie last year's encounter 20-20 with 11 seconds remaining to finish 8-1-1. Ken Jenkins '82 stated, "" They will have revenge on their minds. We knocked them out of the (NCAA Division I-A) playoffs last year."" Curtis remarked, "" A win against B.U. will mean every thing. It's a challenge to shoot at.""  The key to victory is "" play ing a complete football game -- a full 60 minutes,""  Curtis said. He added, "" We'll have to score and score quickly,""  and "" our defense must shut down (Jim ) Jensen, the most dominant quarterback Bucknell has played this year.""  The 6-foot-5,225 pound Jensen has led Boston University to a 16-2-1 mark in two seasons as starter and has completed 55 per- cent of his passes for 1,165 yards and nine touchdowns this year The top Terrier ball carrier is sophomore tailback Gregg Drew who has 910 rushing yards for the season, including five 100-yard games. Drew's average of 101 yards per game ranks fourth in ECAC Division I-AA. Offensively, the Bisons "" must confuse and destroy""  the "" big, strong and aggressive""  Terrier defense, according to Curtis. He added, "" We must use our smart ness and intelligence and not let them get solidified (at the line of scrimmage) -- keep them off balance."" Curtis concluded, "" Our players have to want this one for themselves. If they get it for themselves, they'll be a winner.'"

Bisons sweep to sixth straight conference title,Photo--Dave Folsom
Pat O'Connor '84 (left) and Doug Pickell '82 race in the cross,
country team's quadrangular meet victory Oct. 4. Pickell was,
the third Bucknell finisher in the ECC Championship race,"ByROBSTETZ The men's cross country team captured their sixth consecutive East Coast Conference crown Saturday by outracirig nine teams over the 5.1 mile Belmont Plateau layout in Philadelphia. The meet was won in machine-like fashion as seven Bison runners finished in the top 10 places. Delaware and St. Joseph's were the Orange and Blue's closest challengers, finishing with team scores of 72 and 84 points, respectively, to trail well behind the 22 points of Bucknell. Bill Reifsnyder '84, the top Bison finisher in every race this fall, crossed the finish line first in 25 minutes, 41.9 seconds, only seven seconds shy of the course record and 15 seconds ahead of St. Joseph's John Crooke, the second place runner. The remaining top 10 runners for the Bisons were Rick Sayre '82 (third in 26:03), Doug Pickell '82 (fifth in 26:10), Jim O'Shea '81 (sixth in 26:11), Mark Hulme '83 (seventh in 26:12), Mike Debraggio '81 (ninth in 26:22) and Steve Bigotto '82 (10th in 26:24). Coach Art Gulden stated, ""We ran a flat, emo tionless race but our hard work throughout the week really paid off."" The Bison junior varsity squad took the first 12 places and 14 of the first 15 to totally dominate the J.V. race. Rich Coffin '82 won the contest in 27:05. The harriers compete in the NCAA District II qualifying meet 11 a.m. Saturday on the Lehigh course, and from there the top five teams will ad vance to the NCAA Championships Nov. 24 in Wichita, Kansas. The Bisons finished fourth in the qualifying race last fall and were 17th place finishers in the NCAA Championships. Among the squads vying for the top five spots will be nationally third-ranked Penn State and highly regarded Villanova, a team the Bisons upset to cap ture the IC4A Championships Oct. 20 in New York City's Van Cortlandt Park. Gulden predicts, ""If we run the way we've been running, we should qualify. The thing is, we do not have to win the meet. It is only a qualifier."""

to Colgate on last-minu,"By JEFF CROSS Former New York Yankee manager Yogi Berra, after a particular ly disheartening defeat, once said, ""The game isn't over till it's over."" His remark immediately came to mind Saturday after the Bisons watched a hard-earned 14-10 lead over Colgate slip from their grasp by surrendering a last-gasp 58-yard touchdown pass with only 12 seconds remaining to fall 17-14 at Memorial Stadium. Bison fans were still buzzing after quarterback A1 Locey '83 capped a spirited comeback by sneaking over the goal line from four yards out to give the Herd a 14-10 advantage with 43 seconds showing on the clock. Head Coach Bob Curtis commented, ""They were defensing a quick pitch to Jenkins on one side and a sweep to the other."" Setting up the go-ahead score was the best executed play in a pressure filled situation of the season. Curtis simply said of the fourth- and-17 call on the Red Raider 21-yard line, ""You gotta make it or else we lose. We knew who we were going to."" Ken Jenkins '82 stated, ""Everyone in the huddle knew we could do it."" Locey dropped back, looked to his downfield receivers to freeze the defenders, then dumped a screen pass to halfback Jenkins on the left side. Jenkins accelerated straight ahead, cut to the outside to avoid the two Red Raiders covering him on the play, then thundered for more yardage before being dragged down at the 4-yard line. The perfectly executed play gave the gridders renewed hope with a first down and astonished the boisterous crowd. Curtis remarked, ""Ken did a heck of a job sitting there waiting before he drifted outside,"" adding, ""He didn't do anything I didn't think he could do."" Earlier in the drive, Jenkins set a new school single season rushing mark with 1,079 yards. On the next series, however, Colgate stunningly recaptured the lead on a 58-yard pass and run play from quarterback Wayne Schuchts to split end Tom Rogers that left 2,500 mouths agape.

Indeed, Head Coach Charlie Woollum concedes, ""We'll never replace what those guys did for the pro gram."" However, nine returning let termen from last season's 20-7 ECC West division winning squad return to give the team hope for another successful campaign. Woollum notes, ""We'll depend on a tenacious man to man defense and our usual fast break ing offense.""

Nebraska man would make changes,
BU  to install lights at crossing,"By JAN  BALAKIAN The University will install two 250 watt lights at the intersection of Route 15 and Moore avenue next month, according to Physical Plant Director John Bell. ... .. The lights and their installation are expected to cost $500, Bell said. The fixtures will extend six feet from traffic light poles at the intersection, ac cording to instructions for installation from the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT). Vice President for Administration and Finance John Zeller wrote to PennDOT Sept. 29, requesting permission to install a flashing warning light in ad dition to the existing traffic light. The Department of Transportation denied his request because it said the traffic light at the crossing is visible from more than 500 feet and therefore a warning light is un necessary. PennDOT responded to Zeller s request in a letter dated Oct. 20. Zeller said he does not favor the building of a bridge or tunnel. Questioning whether students would use the tunnel, he said he has "" seen no study that proves that a bridge or a tunnel would ap propriately solve the problem.""  Zeller said a tunnel would be dark and prompt muggings. He also said since a tunnel would probably be constructed below the creek, running past the intersection, flooding would be likely to occur. Zeller said the construction of either a bridge or a tunnel must include provisions for the handicapped. He said such provisions, which include the construc tion of ramps, would detract from the aesthetics of the bridge, and cost an exorbitant amount of money. Mary McNerney '81, who was struck by a car on the night of Sept. 23 while walking her bicycle across the intersection, is now at home recu- By MATT KARANIAN A job offer to fill the newly created position of Director of Security and Safety here has been offered to 34-year-old David Castilow, the current assistant director of security at the Univer sity of Nebraska. The University has asked Castilow to begin working Jan. 1, and although a contract has yet to be signed, Castilow is expected to accept the offer. Vice President for Administra tion and Finance John Zeller said he expected to receive a signed contract from Castilow in Wednesday's mail. He said he spoke with Castilow Monday and had "" every reason to think he will sign."" . , ,, C astilow said T u esday, however, that such an assump tion would be "" premature.""  He said the University and he have reached a "" preliminary deci- sion,"" and although he "" foresees returning the contract,""  he said he is "" still negotiating."" "" I sent back my reply to . Bucknell yesterday,""  Castilow said Thursday. He refused to con firm or deny having signed the contract, because it is still in the mail system, and Zeller does not know his response yet. Chief of Security Norman Fine will be allowed to retain his job with the University, but will be subordinate to the new director. Zeller said Fine would not be forced to retire, but said that he "" hoped"" he would "" see the light"" and do so. Zeller said he has not received word from Fine whether he will retire or not. Fine has "" told others""  that he will retire at the end of the year, but he "" hasn't given us a date,""  Zeller said. Fine has said he will retire Dec. See SECURITY, page 5. perating."
"Suarez, Thum",

for ABS posts,"University students will go to the polls Tuesday to choose be tween juniors Michael Suarez and Bill Thum for the presidency of the Association of Bucknell Students. Between 35 and 40 percent of the 3150 students enrolled here this semester -- and therefore eligible to vote -- are expected to cast ballots for vice president, secretary and treasurer of the ABS as well. The existence of a race for president for the first time since 1977, however, could push the turnout as high as 50 per cent. Voting stations will be open in the uphill and downhill lobbies of the University Center from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. The eight candidates for the four positions will hold an "" open forum"" and debate at 7:30 p.m. Sunday in Leiser House, the home of the Cross-Generational Program on St. Georfie Street.

can political thought now.,"From ROTHENBERG, page 1 When asked how he believes President-elect Reagan's policies will affect college students, Rothenberg predicted that stu dent loans, tuition tax credits and subsidies for colleges in general will be cut. Rothenberg said the Reagan administration will "" kill""  the Department of Educa tion. Rothenberg's conservative analysis of the GOP sweep was based on four assumptions: widespread anti-Carter senti ment, rejection of the Demo cratic party, opposition to liberalism and the growing power of the so-called "" new right"" movement. The apparent shift of the public's attitude to a more con servative philosophy is based more on actual dissatisfaction with the liberal candidates, however, Rothenberg said the new administration believes there should be less interference by groups like the Equal Employ ment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and that affirmative ac tion programs will be "" severely limited"" as a result. Rothenberg said "" discrimina tion on account of race and sex is wrong.""  He also said groups "" like the EEOC and affirmative action programs foster racial and sex discrimination."" Rothenberg's comment re called the controversy last spring when the University hired Linda Thomas to replace him as an in structor of political science here. She was chosen in order to bring an element of "" diversity""  to the faculty here, according to Chair man of the Department and Asso ciate Professor of Political Science John Peeler. Peeler has said the faculty is "" overwhelmingly composed of white males and a black woman would provide a needed diversi- ty Rothenberg gained campus wide attention when he criticized this action by the University. Only three current faculty members--Peeler, Thomas and Associate Professor of Religion William Becker--attended the lecture. After his speech entitled "" Ronald Reagan and the New Right, or Bye Bye Birch Bayh,"" Rothenberg said he hoped he had been invited back as "" a serious commentator, not as a former professor or a performer."" The presentation was spon sored by the local chapter of Omicrom Delta Kappa, a na tional collegiate leadership organization. In introducing Rothenberg, ODK President David Polsky '81 said the lecturer "" brings to this campus a refreshingly different perspective lacking now from the campus."

By DAVID HAWKINGS,"Stuart Rothenberg is still taking the offensive against the University. ,, . , Though the controversy surrounding Rothenberg s claim of discrimination against him by Bucknell six mon ths ago has been forgotten by all but a few including Rothenberg -- the former visiting assistant professor of political science is still pursuing what he calls "" some type of satisfaction."" . . . . . Rothenberg now contends that administration officials have "" continued to let the issue die down""  since his ap pointment was terminated in June, despite assurances that his grievances would be aired "" in a public forum. University President Dennis O'Brien made a "" verbal agreement""  with Rothenberg, in May, that a story on af firmative action hiring policies would appear in Bucknell World -- the University's alumni magazine -- sometime this fall, Rothenberg said. But the story has never ap peared, and Director of Public Relations and Publications Roland King said this week the story is "" on hold."" A story commissioned by the University and written by a freelance writer, Marjie Fusco of Milton for a $75 fee, however, was "" too far off target"" and "" didn t hang together well enough""  to be used for publication in the eyes of King, O'Brien and Provost Wendell Smith, ac cording to King. ________ _______ _ _______________ _ Although King said it was "" abnormal""  for ad ministrators to see Bucknell World stories before they were printed -  they did only because they were "" directly involved,"" he said -- the publication is not censored and the story's withdrawal had "" nothing to do with Rothenberg's case."" O'Brien also said the story had not been pulled. Rothenberg said in an interview after his lecture Mon day night that the story's "" disappearance""  means "" it did not present the case for affirmative action strongly enough,""  adding that he planned to write O'Brien a letter i complaining that the president "" went back on our agree ment."
Fraternity rush ends,
as,
70,
% of frosh join,
More than 300 pledge 13 houses,"By LISA CERUTI More than 300 men pledged fraternities Sunday after eight weeks of rush, with approximate ly 70 percent of the freshman class accepting bids. ____________ Names of fraternity pledges listed. Page 4. This percentage is consistent with the record-breaking number of men who pledged last year. According to Stu Flavell '81, In terfraternity Council vice presi dent, and rush chairman and a member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity, the pledges were "" pretty well spread out"" among the houses. "" I'm very pleased that most of the houses that needed to do well did and that the whole rush system seemed to work successfully,"" Flavell said. More than 80 percent of the freshmen registered for rush, ac cording to IFC President Steve Kohn '81. The percentage of men who eventually pledged was almost exactly the same as last year, despite some changes in the rush system. Rush lasted eight weeks this fall instead of the usual nine. In addition, each rushee was required to formally register and pay a $2 registration fee. The money collected by the IFC was used to defray Greek Weekend expenses. Sigma Chi fraternity took the largest pledge class, with 57 men accepting bids. 17 men pledged Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity, a dramatic upswing from last year's pledge class of one. Phi Lambda Theta fraternity pledged eight men and is the only house that took fewer than twelve pledges. Phi Beta Sigma fraterni ty in accordance with national rules cannot rush until second semester. Flavell said although the percentage of freshmen pledging this fall is "" almost identical to the number last November,"" this year's distribution of pledges was more even. He said, "" Although there were a lot of groans and some houses felt that the guys were not very enthusiastic, the freshmen pulled. through in the end."" Flavell added, "" A couple of houses that expected to do well didn't because they really didn't seek out the rushees."" Although the pledges were generally spread among the 13 fraternities participating in rush, there was a wide range in the ratios of extended bids to accep tances. Flavell attributed this variance to the different selection pro cedures used by each fraternity, "" Obviously, if you bid one out of every five freshmen, the resulting pledge class will be , large,""  . .<<* J ia iiiiiiil^ p R w g _______ Photo-- Megan Young"
"The number of hot-water washing machines will be cut in half, beginning next month, in",

Hot-water washers cut-back;,
need for energy savings cited,
By MADELON HENEHAN,"The number of hot-water washing machines available on campus will be reduced by 50 percent beginning Dec. 1. The University Committee on Energy Conserva tion prompted the move. The reasons for the cut back in the number of hot-water washers included a need "" to save the University money,""  to "" conserve energy,"" and to "" promote awareness (of the energy shortage),"" according to Glen Tullman '81, student representative to the committee. Of the 34 washing machines in the laundry rooms of residential buildings, only 17 will supply hot water. The buildings housing only one machine will not lose their hot water, however. In dormitories where five machines operate, such as in Swartz Hall, three will operate only with cold water, Tullman said. "" We don't want to take away choice. That's why we're not converting 100 percent,""  Tullman said The reduction in the number of hot-water machines will continue "" forever, or as long as there is an energy crisis,""  said Assistant Director of the Physical Plant and committee member Robert Naugle. It is likely that no more than one hot water machine will be available in any residential building by January, Naugle said. The conversion being made gradually. "" No capital investment""  is involved in making these changes, Naugle said. According to Tullman, the University hopes eventually move to a system where people would pay more for hot water and less for cold. Right now it's not practical,""  said Tullman, because l would neccesitate making costly renovations to ex isting machines. Naugle said he could not estimate the amount of energy likely to be conserved or the amount of money it.is hoped wiU.be"

Page 5,"H i S I A f. From SECURITY, page 1. 31 and he reiterated his plans for retirement Tuesday. Fine said he verbally told Zeller of his retire ment plans in June, and that he has also notified the personnel of fice. Asked if he would send a writ ten notice of his intentions to Zeller, Fine responded "" Why should I tell Zeller'.' Zeller said he cannot assume Fine will retire until he receives a written statement from him, but Fine refused to comment about the possibility of even issuing Zeller a written notice. Fine has served 18 years as chief of security. He said he "" still thinks this is a good security staff here,"" and that he is "" proud of his record. His position will not be con tinued after he retires. Instead, his rank will be filled by a patrolman, Zeller said. A reorganization of Campus Security is expected to begin next year. Castilow -- if he accepts the University's job offer -- will work to make the force "" more profes sional,""  Zeller said. Zeller did not refer specifically to Castilow, however, and re fused to reveal his identity because he has yet to accept the job offer. Castilow was referred to only as being from a "" midwestem state institution."" Structural changes in the operation of security here are ex pected to include a new "" pattern of operation""  with "" someone on duty 24 hours a day, seven days a week,""  Zeller said. Castilow said Thursday there is "" room for change at Bucknell. He said if he accepts the post, he would like to see "" people- oriented things that are not done know."" .. He listed "" crime prevention programs""  and an "" escort ser vice""  as programs he would like to introduce. A shift in the job emphasis of patrolmen away from the distinc tion of "" night watchmen""  and to one of campus patrollers is planned. Zeller said although he wants the force to be profes sional, he said he does not mean the same type of professionalism that exists at the municipal level. He said he is concerned with the safety of students and does not want them arrested when they can be helped. Perhaps as a reflection of this change in emphasis, the name of the department has been changed. Formerly "" Campus Security,""  the unit is now known as "" Security and Safety."" Zeller, although admitting he is trving to change the "" image"" of security, said the image change should be accompanied by a change in "" substance.""  He said he wants security here to be seen as "" highly qualified."" "" We want students to have con fidence in Security,"" Zeller said. A new security office located "" in the center of campus""  is also planned. Zeller said the new of fice would be in an existing building and would serve the campus more effectively than the present one in the physical plant. Zeller ruled out the University Center as a possibility. Security will also be an autonomous department next year, and will not report to the director of the physical plant, he said. Physical Plant Director John Bell now oversees the security operation, but next year, the security director would report on ly to Zeller. Castilow has degrees in cam pus law enforcement and "" would be qualified to teach law enforce ment if we offered it,""  Zeller said. . * A search committee chaired by Dean of Student Affairs John Dunlop screened candidates for the position of Director of Securi ty and Safety, and chose Castilow as its prime candidate two weeks ago. Members of the committe in cluded Director of Residenii.il Life Brenda Gordon, Associate Professor of Sociology MatUmw Silberman, Bell and two recci!1 alumni. Although Fine and- Assistant Chief of Security Mike Amarante were not on the committee, they were allowed to meet Castilow recently. Zeller said they did "" not real ly""  have any say in hiring Castilow, however. After meeting him, Fine said Castilow would be a "" credit to Bucknell,'' and that he is well qualified."" ik EPkH I 9 ^ . s i"" ' * Photo-- Mott Koranion"

Zeller announced Tuesday the University has hired Francis Maresca of Riverside and James Middleton of Harrisburg to fill the vacant patrolman positions. Maresca is a retired New York City police officer. He served 20 years on the force there before taking a position with the River side Borough police department two years ago. Middleton is a recent graduate of the Harrisburg Area Com munity College. He graduated wiih an associate degree in police administration and has worked for the Burns Security Agency in Harrisburg. Maresca and Middleton were among 80 candidates for the two vacant positions. Amarante, Fine and A ssociate D irector of Residential Life Gerry Commer- ford screened the candidates. The two patrolmen positions were made available when Zeller fired patrolmen Charles Gross and Ralph Strunk "" for cause."" Zeller has continued to refuse to explain the reason for his_ac-_ tion.

Civil rights urged in,
address by Carter,"Asserting that his plans on behalf of human rights in Latin America will outlive his ad ministration, President Carter indirectly encouraged President elect Reagan to continue his ef forts when he takes office. In his first formal speech since his defeat in the election, Carter explained he is "" convinced a new conscience has awakened"" regarding civil rights as a univer sal concept. White House officials said Carter's statements were raised to counter Reagan's accusations during the campaign that the United States has been trying to impose its moral beliefs on other countries. Carter also urged a strict policy of non-intervention in the turbulent nations of Nicaragua and El Salvador."

Senate approves a,
busing use cutback,"Disregarding last-minute pleas by defenders of civil rights legislature, the Senate passed a bill, 51 to 35, Monday which could cut the use of busing as a means for school desegregation. The bill would stop the Justice Department, which has been a driving force behind desegrega tion attempts in the past, from us- ing funds to pursue legal cases in order to put busing orders into ef fect. Private interests, however, could continue to bring segrega tion cases and the court would still be able to impose ap propriate busing orders. Cases that have already been acted upon would not be affected by this ruling."
Shooting deaths of,
blacks investigated,"The shooting deaths of four blacks by policemen in New Orleans early Wednesday morn ing is being investigated by Federal, State, and Local agents, two civil rights groups, and several public interest organiza tions. The mood surrounding the deaths is one of fear, disbelief, and anger, according to Rose Loving, executive director of a local community organization there. The incident follows the murder of a city patrolman November 8."
Court bars prayers,
in NY public schools,"Emphasizing the "" wall of separation"" between church and state, a Federal appeals court issued a decision Monday pro hibiting public school students from holding prayer meetings in school. The case involves a group call ed the Students for Voluntary Prayer from Guilderland High School near Albany. According to several judges, authorization of prayer meetings would have created "" an improper ap pearance of official support"" for religion. In Washington Monday, the Supreme Court ruled against tne posting of the Ten Command ments in Kentucky school rooms."
Kennedy expresses,
support for Reagan,"Continuing his ceremonial tour of Washington, Wednesday, President-elect Ronald Reagan met with Senator Edward Ken nedy. Kennedy said he sought the meeting to offer his support for Reagan, and discuss arms con trol efforts and budget cuts. Kennedy expressed his support for Reagan's desire to cut Federal expenditures and renew strategic arms limitations talks with the Soviet Union. He also said he is in favor of job-creating economic programs."

Receptacles will be placed' in Vaughan Literature Building, Marts Hall, and Dana Engineer ing, according to Vice President of Administration and Finance, John Zeller. If this initial phase is suc cessful, it will be expanded to other buildings, Zeller said.

As the fall sales campaign drew to a close today, over 600 books were sold, Zimmerman said, with a surprising majority purchased by the class of 1983. With an overall sales goal of 1500 books, Zimmerman said he expects to sell 900 by the end of the second campaign, which consists of letters mailed to parents over Thanksgiving vacation. At the end of Christmas vacation last year, a total of 800 books were sold, Zimmer man said. A final sales campaign will be held in the spring, but the present price of $13.50 per copy will be raised to a minimum of $16.00, co-sales manager Ginny Bagley '81 said. The cost of the book is kept low to en courage students to buy early, because first semester sales determine the budget for the book, she said."

THE BUCKNELL DILEMMA,
By STEVE PIORIO,
Three of Rothenberg's criticisms are still pertinent,"By TODD G. BUCHHOLZ The greatest contribution Stuart Rothenberg, former assis tant professor at Bucknell who left last spring when his contract was not renewed, made to Buck nell was to thrust in front of facul ty, students and administration the faults of Bucknell academia. Some applauded, some ignored and some scorned him. In letters and interviews in the Bucknellian last semester, Rothenberg tried to enlighten. Three of his primary criticisms still apply and if we are serious about education, we will debate them before we pay a $1000 increase in tuition. First, the importance of ideology: In a Bucknellian inter view with Rothenberg, I spec ulated ""the U.S. could elect a very conservative man to the Presidency, while the Universi ty's political science department could be left without a single ex ponent of conservative philo sophy."" That was March 21,1980. Here we are. Are we deprived? Is something missing? Yes. You can't expect liberal or leftists who believe passionately in their cause, to speak for the conser vatives. We call them professors because they ""profess"" ; they preach what they've devoted their lives to. Fine. But when we want a debate where do we find an alternative this year? You could pile up lef tists in the economics and political science departments like you could pile uneaten lima beans in the cafeteria. Last year Rothenberg debated Professor Richard Peterec on South African divestment, Jim Wilson '81 on Washington D.C. voting rights and Professor Tom Travis on detente. Again, is something missing this year? It is irresponsible. Second, the tenure system: ""The University is bound to con tinue with teachers who shouldn't be teaching. I think it hurts the University more than it helps,"" Rothenberg said in March. Here's where faculty blood pressure builds. All of us can name professors we've been warned about. In almost every department there's at least one who is incompetent or worse. If they are visiting professors, they may not be rehired. If they are tenured, we are stuck with them. What does the administration do? I asked President O'Brien at an ABS meeting. He responded that they may be subtly per suaded to retire, may be moved to other positions, or may be granted leaves to get them out of"

At a Planning and Budget Com mittee meeting, Provost Wendell Smith suggested increasing pro ductivity among faculty to justify higher salaries. Professor Steve Becker threw up his arms ex claiming: ""How can you do that. There's no way! Productivity doesn't apply to academics."" Dear professors, eliminating incompetents is the first lesson in applied productivity. Finally, lack of intellectual en vironment: In an April 18, 1980 letter to the Bucknellian, Rothenberg assailed the faculty and students for not attending Colloquy programs. He was cor rect in aiming his salvos at both. Students seem content to com plete homework and go to frater nity parties. Faculty seem con tent to complete classwork and go home. But isn't the idea of a small University in a small town based on the premise that an academic environment will be established? Shouldn't our goal be discussions out of the classroom, at each other's homes, at the Bison, etc.? To quote Rothenberg: ""The standard excuse will be that family pressures made it im possible . . .  These points are cer tainly valid.. . but, is it too much to ask that faculty members find two or three hours to attend at least a couple of events?"" Professor John Anderson in a memorandum to the Planning and Budget Committee asserts that ""There is ample evidence that faculty morale is already be ing affected by last year's deci sion on compensation."" Will higher salaries raise morale and get professors out of their homes? Are these productivity increases we can expect? How is morale manifest anyway? Stuart Rothenberg knows what an academic environment should be like. After his lecture, he and his wife Elaine (Rusinko, former assistant professor of Russian here), Professor Dan Quinlan and a small group of students discussed ideologies, Bucknell and politics over beer for about three hours. That's what the University needs -- people whose minds remain open after the books are closed and the paychecks cashed. And that's what students should demand of themselves -- and of faculty. giiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiHiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiimiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiH|"

Seeing the light,
The prompt action by the University authorizing the installation,
of two additional lights at the intersection of Route 15 and Moore,
Avenue deserves recognition.,
",",
"Within one week after a serious accident at the location, Jonn",
Zeller wrote a letter to the Pennsylvania Department of Transpor,
tation requesting that they place a warning flasher in the area.,
"After the agency refused, the University obtained permission to",
install the 250 watt lights.,
". ,,",
o .,
"We commend this action, as it increases the likelihood of a sate",
"crossing by residents of Bucknell West, intramural participants",
and many others. It is clearly the first step in the right direction.,
What is needed now is a safety commitment on the part of those,
who must cross at the intersection. People who dash across Route,
15 wherever it is convenient rather than using the soon-to-be-,
"lighted crosswalk endanger themselves, other pedestrians, and",
motorists.,
. . .,
". ,",
.,
",",
Now that the University has taken action to insure student safe,
ty at this dangerous crossroad we must respond by acting safely,
and responsibly.,
Changing the image,
The University will likely have a new Director of Security and,
Safety in January. We'll be getting a new man to fill a newly created,
position: he will work to give the force a new image and to provide it,
with new direction.,
"Even the names have been changed. We'll have a "" Director of",
"Security and Safety"" and not a "" Chief of Campus Security.""",
"In fact, the entire subject has a born-again flavor to it. But, as",
"John Zeller has said, change in substance is more important than a",
mere change in image. We agree. And we are concerned that,
"although the names and faces may change, the real content may re",
main the same.,
The security staff here has traditionally been little more than a,
"group of night watchmen, conducting their business from sundown",
to sunup. Some new blood in the security department could effective,
"ly change this. There are plans for a shift in the emphasis of the job,",
"from that of mere watchmen to "" 24 hours a day, 7 days a week""",
patrolmen.,
Other hoped for changes include moving the headquarters back on,
"campus, where it belongs, and out of the Physical Plant building.",
"David Castilow, of Omaha, Nebraska, a prime candidate for the",
"position as Director, agrees there is plenty of "" room for change""",
here. He would like to see security become more service oriented.,
"Among other "" people-oriented things"" that he says are needed are a",
crime prevention program and an escort service.,
"So far, the proposed revampings lay only in the realm of imagery.",
But the vision for the future bears prospects for renovations that are,
"real, substantial--and very necessary.",
We hope some new blood in the department will help bring these,
changes to fruition.,
Airing the linen,
Just when you thought it was safe to stop worrying about faculty,
"hiring procedures, the six-month old case of Stuart Rothenberg was",
brought to renewed attention this week when the former professor,
returned as a guest lecturer.,
",",

In a renewed attempt to air adequately his views on what he calls,
"is a discriminatory practice, Rothenberg says he made an agree",
ment that his opinions would be aired as part of a larger look at af,
firmative action and the University's stand on it. But though Presi,
"dent O'Brien said the issue is worth discussion, an initial attempt to",
do just that has been scrapped.,
-,
. . ..,
While we understand the constramts of the publications staff,
and though our inability to locate the freelance story makes judge,
ment on it impossible -- it is nonetheless easy for us to recommend,
the project of publicizing the issue in a public forum like Bucknell,
"World be taken off of "" hold.""",
' .,

A unbiased and thorough reporting of the Rothenberg case and its,
implications for the University has been our aim since it surfaced.,
"We think the University should want, and is obliged, to air its",
philosophical linen for all its constituents to see.,

LETTERS,
Chapel Choir (continued),"To the Editor: After reading last week Bucknellian and the three letters to the editor published therein in reference to the Chapel Choir, I feel obliged to respond in support of Professor Christopher McGahan. If the writers felt McRae was "" undeservedly tainted""  by the article of the previous week, I-can't begin to characterize the implied slurs on McGahan's abilities inherent in these letters. In particular, I would like to indicate that Dianne Bouvier '81 has not been singing in the choir since McGahan took over its direction and that Barbara Ann Rudolph '80 has not bedh a member of the choir at any time. As for myself, I have been a member since the beginning of my freshman year and have experienced both the "" old"" and the "" new""  choir. I thus feel my opinion to be a better-informed one. In an organization as tight-knit as the Chapel Choir, one can only under stand its successes and failures if one has worked within the group. McRae was the founder and spirited director of the choir I joined in 1978, but having sung in several choirs since childhood, I felt the level of musical professionalism a university choir ought, in my opinion, to exhibit, was less than realized. McRae gave the choir a great deal in terms of spirit and love, but this did not compensate musically for the needed technique. Upon McRae's succession by McGahan, the choir immediately underwent many transformations, particularly in terms of the level of musicianship required of its members. McGahan introduced techni ques, especially eurhythmies, that were new to the group. These were viewed by many with the suspicion and disdain that I would never have expected of my fellow singers. Instead of accepting McGahan's attempts to improve the musical level of the choir, several choir members resented any changes in the McRae traditions and actively resisted his efforts. I saw some of the most loyal choir members turn against their newly-appointed director in attempts to get him dismissed from the Department of Music. That McGahan stood his ground in the face of this resistance to progressive change took a strength of character for which I applaud him. When these resistors to change left dissatisfied, the growth of the "" new"" Chapel Choir began. The level of musicianship attained by the remaining members was a source of great pride for us all, especially for our director. While the majority of the group graduated in June, five remain this year to form the backbone of the Choir, which current ly numbers 20 and is composed mostly of freshmen. Since September, our musical growth, both as individuals and more importantly as an ensemble, has been tremendous. It has come from the efforts of talented, dedicated individuals, but it is rooted in the musicianship, energy and determination of Christopher McGahan.

Reader questions need,
for disturbed man story,
Andrews' political spectrum,"To the Editor: In response to the article: "" Disturbed local man . . . ""  in the Nov. 7 issue of the Bucknellian: A "" mental health problem""  is just what the name implies, a health problem, one that we may not completely understand as we do physical illness, but it is an ill ness. A hurt mind needs as much care as a hurt body, empathy, although not sympathy. To print an article detailing the actions of a person who has been or is under By PHIL ANDREWS 2500 years ago, Confucius noted that "" If names are not correct, language will not be in accordance with the truth of things.""  As careful as the Bucknellian has been this year to follow this obser vation, last week's headlines pertaining to the Bucknell Progressive Caucus (BPC) reflected con fusion more than Confucius. As a non-radical member of the BPC, and as one who was quoted in the article entitled "" Meeting of radicals draws large crowd,""  I would like to dispel the notion created by that headline that BPC members are necessarily radical. My guess (I am neither an officer of, nor an official spokesperson for the BPC) is that most BPC members would ob ject to being classified as radical. Because the words radical, liberal, conservative and progressive are prescriptive as well as descrip tive and because there are critical differences be tween the terms, I offer the following as an inter pretation of what they mean in general and in United States politics in particular. My definition of a radical is one who believes that the roots of society's problems lie in its dominant political, economic, and/or social institutions. Thus, a radical believes that fundamental changes are needed in the structure of those institutions. A radical may or may not advocate working within the existing political system to change it. In U.S. politics, a radical is considered extreme. Thus,, a common tactic of politicians is to label an opponent or an idea they don't like as radical. My definition of a liberal is one who believes that society's dominant institutions are basically sound, but need to be tinkered with occasionally to better meet society's needs. A liberal is receptive to change and advocates working through the existing political system to achieve it. In U.S. politics, a liberal is generally considered to be one who has "" great faith in the ability of the Federal Government to protect and defend its peo ple"" according to Mary McGovern, daughter of the defeated Senator. The word protect is taken to in- clude protection from poverty, exploitation, hunger, disaster and other undesirable conditions. My definition of a conservative is one who believes that society's institutions are sound, and that efforts to reform them usually do more harm than good. A conservative conserves the status quo, in contrast to a reactionary who reacts against the status quo and proposals to reform it. In U.S. politics a conservative is generally con sidered to be one who opposes a larger federal government role in the economy and in social welfare areas. A larger role for the states and/or for the private sector is preferred as the best course of action. My definition of a progressive is one who believes that most of society's institutions are sound, but that some require fundamental change. The pro gressive attempts to preserve those institutions con sidered good with the same fervor that he/she tries to change those institutions considered bad. As long as political freedom exists and electoral fraud by the governing authorities does not, a progressive works within the existing system. In U.S. politics, my guess is that most pro gressives support economic democracy (i.e. worker participation in, and/or control of manage ment decisions), equal rights for all regardless of sex or sexual preference, laws that would strengthen civil liberties and civil rights provisions and the development of a conserver ethic toward the environment. Additionally, I think most progressives would strongly support supranational efforts to tackle global problems. Nationalism and militarism would generally be viewed as counterproductive to prog ress on this front. Rudyard Kipling once wrote, "" Words are, of course, the most powerful drug used by mankind.' As drugs can heighten or obscure understanding and stimulate or depress action, so too can words Let us use them with care. ' Phil Andrews '81, form er A B S  president, is a member of the n e w ly-fo rm e d  B ucknell P ro g re ssiv e Caucus. treatment for mental illness seemed very insensitive. I'm sure Wise didn't need the kind of attention you allotted him by printing the article as front page news. People have pro blems, each and every one of us, some greater than others, and it's time we concern ourselves with how the other person might feel. Susan J. Frederick New Berlin, Pa. Nov. 10,1980"

As some of my friends are well aware, I have been pleading the case of Bison, as opposed to Bisons, for a number of years. I regret to say that I have met with very little success. There is, however, one place on campus where one can witness the cor rect use of the plural noun -- in Memorial Stadium. The helmets worn by Bucknell football players say Bison, not Bisons.

President,
------,
Michael Suarez '82,"A second area of change would be to unite the students In a project Involving the talents of both Colleges to solve specific problems within the greater University community, emphasizing that responsibility does not end with studies and socializing but entails an ac tive caring for one's environment and fellows. I believe my great amount of experience In dealing with the trustees, administration, faculty and students through University com m ittees, social events such as Homecoming and fund raising efforts such as the 1980 Phone-A-Thon have given me a high level of insight into how things get ac complished at Bucknell. Now, I'd like to take that experience and use it to fulfill the ABS's and students' poten tial to the greatest extent. I'd appreciate your support in my effort."
Vi re President,
Missy Campbell '82,"Did you ever wonder what the ABS really does? Could it ever make a difference? I share the same concerns. I've seen Bucknell student government from nearly every angle: as vice president of my freshman class, president of Vedder Dorm Council, member of the Committee On Student Pro grams, ABS Appropriations Committee member, University Council member and ABS Congressman for the past two years. I know what's wrong with our student govern ment and I plan to resolve some of its longstanding problems. We need an action-oriented ABS, an ABS with realistic clearly defined goals, an ABS with priorities that can be translated into policy. It is not sufficient for the ABS Con gress merely to discuss and propose action; empty lip service profits no one. It is time that practical productive programs were developed. Programs that act on issues such as women's safety on campus, alcohol policy and constructive means of limiting tuition hikes. To be a critical watchdog over the ad ministration Is not enough; all facets of the University should work together to effect constructive change. Only then can we call ourselves a community. The ABS has a long way to go before it ade quately fulfills its potential. It must begin by earning the respect of its community. We need a president with the experience, originality, enthusiasm and -- most im portantly -- leadership to make the ABS a viable force at Bucknell. I pledge a high degree of personal commit ment to make ABS an effective working body. I challenge you to do the same. directive with an almost unlimited op portunity to get things done. I would bring my interest and enthusiasm to this job-attending to the designated responsibility of running the elections, but also initiating some projects I have been looking forward to, such as stimulating sup port for the arts on campus. I know how this can be done, motivation and interest would keep me on top of the situation monitoring the decision-making, seeing that no op portunities pass by, and creating new possibilities for an enriched college ex perience. The vice president has a power base that, if elected, I intend to exploit to its fullest in the students' interest. I would approach the administration from this base to assure stu dent representation. The vice-presidency is a power base that could well support my platform of aid to the arts, increased coed living and more solar mods. With your support I could assume a leading role in an ABS Congress, respected by the administration for its common sense and students for its active role at Bucknell."
Mark Barbour '82,"to remain unprejudiced In my decisions about budgetary allocations. Without employing a "" time and energy"" cliche; I want to reiterate that I possess no naivete about what the office of treasurer in volves. All of student government at Bucknell must be strong and willing to use this strength to move securely and steadily toward a position of respect in the Bucknell community."
Secretary,
Lon Castle '83,
Treasurer,
Andy Brody '82,
Bill Thum '82,"In the past two and a half years at Bucknell I have become quite Involved In several aspects of the University. This In volvement has exposed me to diverse opi nions and attitudes among the student body, faculty and administration. I am asking you at this time to elect me as vice president of ABS because I feel I have built a firm base of experience and am ready to help set the guidelines upon which ABS will act during the next year. ABS as a whole has been hard-struck by an unfortunate trend of apathy among students. It has served largely as an information source for current events on campus and as a place where students could air their views on specific Issues such as the third floor of the UC, University relations and the budget. By developing "" action teams"" on issues to research and develop proposals, I believe we can be a much more effective body, and perhaps gain the recognition we need as an active -- rather than passive -- body. I have proven my interest in becoming an active member of our student body through my Involvement in Swartz Dorm Council (serving two years as secretary), ABS Con gress and Appropriations Committee, and the Committee on Instruction, and will use this experience if elected to the best interest of all Bucknellians. Being treasurer of the ABS is a responsible position and a responsible person should be elected. In spite of this I am still running for the office. I have been a dorm representative to the ABS Congress for the past two years and have not been involved in any scandals or been accused of using my position to gain unfair advantages over others. I feel I have obtained a good understanding of how the ABS operates and what its goals and objec- tives are. I could tell you that I was treasurer of my high school class, currently a 4.0 accounting major and want to be president of Citibank when I graduate. But I won't. Besides, it's not true. What I will say is that as treasurer I would make sure the students' money was spent and allocated in the best interest of the students. I am certain I am capable of main taining accurate accounts, and would make sure no money was mishandled or wasted. It takes 25 minutes to get lunch at the Roy Grier; it only takes two minutes to vote."

. 9,"Since freshman year, I have experienced a love-hate relationship with Bucknell. While given the large amount of talented students gathered here, their potential has rarely been realized. Part of the problem involves the Ineffectiveness of the present ABS, where students are rarely motivated to critically evaluate the University and press for change. I would like to be given the op portunity to remedy this situation. One area of change would be within the ABS itself through a greater exposure to the campus, a concentration on action and not talk, and a momentum which stimulates the students to take the problems they see at Bucknell and work for reform. To successfully fulfill the responsibilities of ABS treasurer, there is a need for understanding the Bucknell community and the people within it. During the last three years, I have actively participated in the campus community. As a sophomore, I co-founded the Students for Environmental Awareness. Through SEA I had the opportunity to work with the Committee on Student Programs and the ABS Appropriations Committee. In the Fall of 1979, SEA organized the colloquy entitled "" Progress: As If Survival Mattered."" This afforded me the opportunity to work with the Concern and Action organization. This semester I was one of the organizers of the Bucknell Progressive Caucus, whose pur pose is to promote political discussion on campus. I have in the past, had the opportunity and the motivation to participate in extracur ricular activities. As treasurer, I will be able to give all the time and energy necessary to fulfill the job. As ABS treasurer, I would have two major functions to perform. First, to be treasurer for the students at Bucknell. This entails be ing responsible for the orderly distribution of student activities fees. I will advocate an open and frank discussion by all students on the allocation of student funds. My second responsibility (of equal im portance) is to work in conjunction with the other members of the ABS Steering Commit tee. By working in close cooperation with other student leaders, I hope to effectuate positive changes in Bucknell policies dealing with tuition, financing, curriculum and ot her issues that affect the Bucknell communi ty. I would hope that all students would work with whomever is elected. To have a dynamic student government, it is necessary to maximize student input. The vice president holds a flexible oifu-e. Free of the day-to-day chores and duties of the president, he operates under his own"

nell ID in order to vote.,"The next year will be a crucial one in deciding the power and influence of student government at Bucknell. The people chosen for the top ABS positions must be strong leaders with Initiative. There is a tendency, however, to focus at tention on the selection of the ABS president and to delegate the other three offices "" unimportant."" The office of treasurer is especially overlooked and underestimated. Financing all clubs and organizations on campus in volves a large budget and organizational ac curacy. I have discussed the responsibilities that this office includes with the present Treasurer, Pam Ecock. The time commit ment is large and the constant shifting of in formation takes a good organizational sense. I have no misconceptions or lack of in formation about the office of treasurer, but 1 do want to address one point that might be influencing some thoughts. I anticipate some people will look on my holding the office of freshman class president and ABS treasurer as "" too much.""  However, my present consti tuents of the freshman class and the people voting in this election should realize that these two offices can complement each other through experience gained and the fresh in put that an experienced freshman student can offer. Hence, I am in a uniquely appropriate position for treasurer; 1 have experience in ABS government as a member of the Con gress, yet I am still new enough at Bucknell As a sophomore, I feel a certain obligation to the other undergraduates and administra tion of the University to become actively in volved in the affairs of student government. This desire to seek office was driven by two personal opinions. First of all, I sincere ly believe our administration has, in several instances, exhibited its interest in the welfare of the students and has endeavored to cater to our needs. Secondly, I also believe that we, as students, have a right to com plain to the administration when we feel as though we are being dealt with unjustly. I think the best way to facilitate the resolu tion of problems and hasten the development of programs which will benefit the students lies in establishing a good relationship bet ween the student body and the administra tion. The initial step in establishing this affilia tion is to inform the students as to what ideas are being discussed and invite their own philosophies on the subject. The second is to incorporate the notions of a wide section of the student body into the workings of the ABS. As secretary, I would strive to make the ideas that circulate within the ABS more widely known to the students of the campus. By doing this, a more precise picture of what the students think could be presented to the administration and -- in turn -- the ad ministration would able to serve the in terests of the students more completely. Student government, both good and bad, thrives on the diversity of its ideas. The dif ference between them, however, depends upon how wide a segment of the population these ideas are derived from. If the student body wishes to make their time at Bucknell more enjoyable, their first priority should be to take an active role in the workings of stu dent eovcmment."

University artists give two fine concert#,
Dancers'performance marked,
"by sparkle, grace & subtle wit","By AMY FORTGANG The Bucknell Dance Company -- for the five years since its foun ding in 1975 -- has had to exist with makeshift theaters in Tustin Gym and the Field House Dance Studio, and though the conditions are much improved this year, the problem still remains. In its fall concert Tuesday night, the troupe took a big step up in its performance ac commodations, but 250 seats in Larison Dining Hall were not enough to hold the crowd of about 450 that flocked to see the dancers. Even the company's of ficers had not anticipated the im mense popularity the event would have and printed only 300 pro grams. Within those programs, shared by the late-comers, was the listing of 11 dances that marked the most successful concert yet of the company. T u e s d a y ' s p e r fo r m a n c e witnessed the latest chapter in the metamorphosis of the Bucknell Dance Company -- nee the Bucknell Dance Club, nee Or- chesis/Ballet Workshop -- and was full of startling revelations. The dances, with the painfully ob vious exception of two very out- of-place numbers, were more subtle than ever before and the dancers themselves were, on the whole, more skilled than they previously had been. The company has evolved into a group of talented dancers whose technical training has been completed enough to allow them to polish their per formances. Newcomers Cheryl Klinger '84 and Charlotte Tsuyuke '84 per formed especially well, with great style and sparkle. Senior Alison Corvington, returned from a semester abroad, also exhibited this piz zazz in the two pieces she danced, as did visiting student Don Mc Cormack. McCormack proved a talented and diverse performer whose im agination and wit -- coupled with an obviously strong ballet/jazz background -- shone in every Photo-- Hilary Segl"

Opening the second half of the show, Mc Cormack and four other dancers -- graduate student Dean Allebach, Melinda Clay '81, Corv ington and Klinger -- presented a piece with a power and depth which has not been seen in recent dance productions here.

here Sunday. Walker took a year's leave of absence to present his abstract,
theater production at campuses around Pennsylvania. The piece-- in the,

"four animals--a bird, an octopus, an ape and a man. Theatre Preserve-",
the name of the entire project--is arrived at from the journal Walker is,

meetings with strangers and the observed reactions to his performance.,

Commanding the stage for the entire two-hour program instead of sharing it with the University Chorale, the orchestra made evident their standing as Bucknell's most polished and thorough musical group. The University Orchestra--directed by Visiting Assistant Professor of Music Christopher McGahan with James Johnston '82 as concertmaster--perform ed two works by Richard Wagner and one by Schubert and Beethoven. The only weak point on the program was the level of passion in Wagner's "" Wesen- donck Lieder"" song cycle. While the or chestra itself did a fine job with the subtle and sometimes sprightly accompaniment for the soloist, soprano Martha Hill (lec turer in Music) was less than convincing in conveying the piece's varied moods. Although her voice was clear and seeming ly effortless, she seemed stoic to the point of fright, and such atmospheres as the steamy, sensuous one of "" Im Treibhaus"" were lost as a result. The other piece by Wagner, a work for a smaller orchestra titled "" Sigfried Idyll,"" was by contrast the evening's most emotive moment. With his reduced group of instrumentalists--including a string quintet--McGahan conceived and brought forth a wide range of audial emotion and a high degree of technical proficiency. The level of competence exhibited by the smaller group was easily equalled by the full orchestra in works by Shubert and Beethoven. In the latter's "" Symphony No. 2 in D,"" the group presented all the dynamics of the full symphonic work. Their precision made it most enjoyable listening. Shubert's "" Overture in the Italian Style,"" a fairly jubilant piece performed briskly and with verve, opened the con cert-. - While- some might complain McGahan "" padded"" Friday's program with a work performed only a month earlier, the overture was well worth a se cond listening. What was most unfortunate was the relatively miniscule crowd there to listen. Pitted against a basketball scrimmage and a glut of fraternity parties the Univer sity Orchestra could not draw more than double its membership to the concert--a most undesirable but recurrent problem here.

New Globe Theatre presents,
somewhat sporadic 'Menagerie',"By DAVID HAWKINGS For the third program in this year's Performing Arts Series, the University has brought us the New Globe Theatre, a troupe whose varied but sporadic talents arrived on campus Thursday and will be in Coleman Theatre tonight and Saturday. While the Connecticut-based theatre company has credits in drama equally as impressive as those of the Fitzwilliam String Quartet in music and the Eric Hawkins Dance Company in modern dance, the New Globe did not reach the level of artistic in tensity attained by either of the previous two visiting groups in its *opening performance Thursday night. In many ways, the troupe's staging of Tennessee Williams Glass Menagerie was enlighten ing in its new interpretations of the 1944 play which has fast become a classic of the American stage. Unfortunately, other aspects of Producing Director Stuart Vaughan's rendition were bland and occasionally confus ing, and the result of this mixture of very fine moments and very forgettable ones gave the evening a pleasant -- though uninspired -- taste. Though it may sound trivial, the show's highlight may well be"

Craig Weind- ling's placement of spots gives us uncannily realistic candles and lamplight, though miraculously he never loses the dreamy quality called forth in the story of un fulfilled wishes. Even the tabletop zoo of glass animals after which the play is named is cast in its own special glow. The contrast in quality was most clearly evident in the roles turned in by the two women whose conflict is perhaps the heart of Menagerie. As Amanda Wingfield, Vera Johnson brought forth a host of subtle emotions and allusions in an above board -- though hardly exaggerated -- manner. Her movements and verbal inflections were perfectly timed; her eloquence gave Amanda's plight a poignancy in itself worthy of a high price of ad mission. As Amanda's daughter Laura, however, Carol Stevenson gave us a performance completely lacking either eloquence or subtlety. The New Globe version of the painfully shy pleurosis vic tim is devoid of any true timidness in all but one scene, and so the effect of the one scene in which she gains confidence in her encounter with her gentleman caller is lost. The other two performances bring the show onto a somewhat more even keel. John FitzGib- bon's Jim O'Connor is a clever, though a bit unsettling combina tion of sincerity and personified scam; Don Perkins--as the nar rating Tom Wingfield-- is a little loud, but inoffensive. Perkins is the only actor who will also be on stage Saturday night, when the New Globe offers George Bernard Shaw's Candida."

for a cultural building,"Photo-- M egan Young Cynthia Gebhard '83 prepares Wednesday's vegetarian dinner. She is one of six student cooks who plan and produce the nightly ""veg"" meals eaten by 350 students. Arrangements are being made for the vegetarian option to become a regular menu item."
Students eat all their vegetables,
Hank Ross has instituted a vegetarian plan Mom would love,"By AMY KENNEDY With a trend toward light eating showing up everywhere in our health and diet-conscious socie ty, the University Dining Service has incorporated a vegetarian entree into its dinner menu for those students who want such an alternative. Each vegetarian meal is prepared by six student cooks. These cooks--Dianne Bouvier '81, Elizabeth Sarver '83, Paul Weiss '83, Cynthia Gebhard '83, Carolynn Stoddard '83 and Helen Maher '83- are not only responsible for preparing the meals, but also for making up a well-rounded weekly menu. Recipes are obtained from an assortment of vegetarian cookbooks supplied by Hank Ross, direc tor of the Dining Service. .. Bucknell is the only school in the country that utilizes students in preparing the vegetarian en trees, according to Ross. ,. "" It is more economical this way, he said, adding that the vegetarian alternative is an expensive one. The meals started three years ago when there were only a couple of seriously interested students Ross said. He said he decided to institute a small program that could "" eventually be worked into the regular meals.""  This idea, though, did not work because the cooks could never judge how much food to make. Sometimes when the meal looked appetiz ing it would all be eaten while at other times there would be a large portion left over, according to sign up and 50 diners opted for the new plan. Ross said the next year began what has been a steadily increasing trend when more than 200 students signed up, and at present there are 350 diners eating the vegetarian meals. Of these, one half are really vegetarians and the remaining half eat the vegetarian meal "" just for a change,""  according to the director. Ross said that "" any opportunity a student has for change is good. Too many Americans overeat,"" he said, "" and we are the largest consumers of meat in the world anyway."" Ross said people should realize that "" meat is not the best thing for you""  and there are alternative sources of protein. He said the main objective of the vegetarian meal plan is to make students more aware of the food they eat and next semester a list of daily minimum requirements filled by each of the meals as well as the amount of calories they contain will be posted in the cafeteria. Ross plans to work on improving the vegetarian program during January to increase the efficiency of meal production and preparation. His major goal for the upcoming period of renovation is the ability to offer the vegetarian meal as a regular entree. Now any students eating the vegetarian meal must sign up and have their meal tickets stamped to qualify them for the dinner. Ross wants to do away with this necessity by making the "" veg""  meal sim ply another menu item. By LIZ HAWLEY The Association for the Arts at Bucknell is a campus organiza tion that has yet to be clearly defined for the students, ac cording to Associate Professor of English Ralph Rees. Although many assume it is responsible for all arts programs occurring throughout the year, this is not the case. All students, whether they know it or not, are considered members of the association, ac cording to Rees, who serves as secretary of the organization and chairman of its Program Com mittee. The group was founded five years ago, Rees said, as an alum ni sponsored and directed organization designed primarily to inspire the construction of a finer auditorium on campus. The largest auditorium here seats on ly 400, and the association's ideal goal is the eventual construction of one that will triple that au dience capacity. The major program of the group -- designed to stimulate a greater appreciation of the arts am ong B ucknellians -- is Celebration of the Arts. During this week - long festival, student and professional artists appear here in a variety of free lectures, performances and coffeehouses. It is hoped that these programs will increase the community's awareness of the arts, Rees said, and will eventually elicit enough enthusiasm to warrant the building of a center on campus dedicated to the arts. Celebration '81 will be held March 8-15. In previous years the Association has brought such celebrities as playwright Edward Albee, actress Cicely Tyson and dancer Edward Villella to the University for the celebration. This year it has booked pro- d u c e r / d i r e c t o r / a c t o r  John Houseman, who played the stern Professor Kingsfield in the movie ""The Paper Chase,"" for the keynote lecture."

The four seniors combined for over 1,000 tackles in their four varsity campaigns. Curtis commented, "" We thought we could shut down their runn ing game. We knew we had to stop Drew (a 1,000-yard rusher) and we had to stop Jensen too.""  Jensen completed 20 of 38 passes for 255 yards but suffered two key interceptions in the losing cause.

We were a great team during the second half of last week's game, ( against Colgate when the Bisons lost 17-14 on a touchdown in the final 12 seconds) but we got floored.""

Polo first in East; now 30-2-2,"From WATER POLO, page 15 The contest was an opportunity for Russell to use his bench, and he substituted ireely. Senior Chris Layton, junior Jeff Payne, sophomores Mike Hoffman and Jon Simone and freshman Scott Mutschler all made contributions in the game and throughout the tournament. Schulte, Gensheimer .and Pax ton all received first team All- East honors for their play over the weekend and Butler was named to iin- second loam. Schulte scored on 19 of 33 shots and added seven assists as he upped his season totals to 172 goais and 83 assists. Gensheimer broke the 100 goal plateau with 106 by recording 13 goals and 23 assists. Paxton recorded 39 saves in the three games including 19 against Fordham to tie his school record. Butler tallied nine goals and his 19 assists increased his school record single season assists total to 126. After the closing ceremonies, highlighted when Russell was given the customary dunking in the pool, the Bisons turned their attention to the NCAA Champion ship. Paxton commented, "" Our first goal will be to beat a Califor nia team and (thereby) finish in the top four."" The Bisons were edged 8-6 by UCLA, the only collegiate team from California they have faced this year, in the Brown Tourna ment Sept. 27 in Providence. The result enabled Bucknell to finish second behind UCLA and showed significant improvement over last year's 17-7 loss to UCLA in the NCAA Championships. In preparation, Russell noted, "" We'll really have to work on our set p lays because (the perennially-dominating Califor nia teams) won't be giving us many counter attacks."" The Bisons' strong point is their high- scoring counter attack."
Bisons-Portugal in unlikely tie,"From BASKETBALL, page 16 only 34 percent from the field in the half, compared to 63 percent for Portugal. Nevertheless, the much-taller Bisons stayed within striking distance throughout the final 20 minutes, never falling behind by more than five points, and scored eight of the final 10 points to earn the tie. The Bisons, having lost four of last year's five starters, showed a "" lack of experience"" and a need to "" develop new chemistry""  according to Woollum. The coach, however, will be patient, stating "" It will take into the season to get these things done."" Bucknell committed 18 turnovers and 37 personal fouls, leading Woollum to remark, "" Most of our mistakes were aggressive mistakes; from a lack of experience. They weren't from lack of effort."" Leslie said, "" We need to think a little more before we act."" Explaining the cagers' 40 percent shooting from the field for the contest, Leslie said, "" We weren't as patient as we should have been."" Leslie, the team captain, noted, "" Coach is putting pressure on me to make everyone patient."" According to Leslie, the combination of the pre game fanfare and "" not being as physically prepared as we should have been"" caused the Bison players to tire easily and caused some of the poor play. Because it was the first game of the season, Woollum commented, "" The emotional buildup burned a great deal of our energy.""  He added, "" We have a lot of work to do. We need to build on strength."" Although students were charged $1 for admission and area residents paid a $2 fee, the exhibition con test "" probably finished in the red""  according to Director of Athletics Bruce Corrie. Corrie explain ed, "" It would have been necessary for us to charge $2 and $3""  to cover the $1,200 guaranteed the Por tuguese Basketball Federation in addition to the hotel and meal expenses incurred by the delegation. Exact figures of the official attendance and the net financial loss are not yet available, Corrie said."

If we run the sam By BOB DAVIS Following his team's im pressive third place finish in the NCAA District II cross country championships last Saturday at Lehigh University, coach Art Gulden commented, "" We ran fast, but we're capable of better -- it wasn't our best race."" The Bisons' best-ever finish in the district race earned them a trip to the NCAA Championship finals Monday in Wichita, Kan sas. The harriers finished 17th in the NCAA Championships in each of the last two seasons. In Saturday's meet, defending champion Penn State lopped the 33-team field for the second year in a row with 37 points followed by Villanova with 71 and Bucknell with 94. The Bisons upset Villanova to win the IC4A Cham pionship Oct. 20 in New York. Solomon Chebor of Fairleigh Dickinson finished first over the 10,000 meter course with a time of 29:19.3. Alan Scharsu and Larry Mangan, both of Penn State, crossed the line second and third in 29:21 and 29:37, respectively. Freshman sensation Bill Reifsnyder was the top Buclmell runner, placing seventh with a time of 29:54.8, the fastest 10,000 run in school history. Tri-captain Rick Sayre '82 was the next Bison to cross the line, finishing 12th in 30:08. According to Gulden it was the best performance of the year by Sayre, who has been frus trated by health problems all season. Rounding out the field for the harriers were junior Steve Bigot- to (20th in 30:33), sophomore Mark Hulme (27th in 30:43), senior tri-captains Jim O'Shea (28th in 30:45) and Mike Debrag- gio (36th in 30:51) and freshman J e ff Hines (53rdin31:08). Gulden said, "" The kids'decided that they wanted to run with Penn State, and they tried, but they (Penn State) were just too good,"" adding "" The aggressiveness we showed was good, but we should've run more under con trol.""  He noted, "" We ran the first , mile too fast.,It set up Jthe quick times, but caused us to fade a lit tle."" The third-place finish does not affect the harriers' dual meet winning streak, which stands at 73. Gulden has altered his prac tices very little in preparation for the"
NCAA,"Championships in simply cutting back from 100 to 80 miles a week and introducing one-quarter-mile sprints into the workouts. Gulden stated, "" Being rested and sharp is important,"" and added, "" We've worked harder than anyone in the conference, but you can't do much condition ing at this point."" Commenting on his team's mental attitude, Gulden said, "" They're not frightened; we've been there before.""  The coach continued, "" They've gained con fidence with each race -- they know they have the ability."" Speculating on the Bisons chances in the 10,000 meter NCAA race involving 29 teams, Gulden said, "" If we run like we did in the IC4A's we could finish in the top 10. If we run the same as last week (in the ECC Cham pionships), we'll be 12th or 14th -- we'll run well."" Texas El Paso, according to Gulden, ' 'will win unless the team gets hit by a truck.""  Their squad features seven Africans, in cluding Sulyman Nyambuia, a 30- year-old teacher from Tanzania who finished second at 5,000 meters in the summer Olympics. Gulden lamented, "" He's their third man -- they've got two guys better than him."" According to Gulden, three of the remaining four top teams are predominantly foreign, including Western Kentucky, East Ten nessee State and Arkansas. He feels Penn State is the best "" all- American"" team. Gulden concluded, "" It's been a super year and very rewarding. We've done more than we had an ticipated."" The harriers defeated all nine of their dual and tri-meet opponents on their way to win ning their sixth consecutive ECC championship Nov. 8 in Philadel phia."

In stead of being intimidated by the vaunted Bisons, the ""thl freshman and sophomore stocked Loyola team rallied behind the strong goal-tending of Chuck Haak, and was able to hold the deficit to 0IIn the^second half, the experienced Bison squad began asserting itself in subtle ways, forcing Loyola further from Bison Tony Paxton '81. Loyola's frustration grew and soon the Bisons were able to spring their forwards on two on one breaks. Unfortunately, the Bisons were consistently thwarted by the outstanding play of Haak, and couldn't put the game away. Eventual ly though, the Bucknell squad became difficult to contain while preventing Loyla from closing the gap. When time expired, the Bisons had virtually secured a return trip to the NCAA's with a 12-9 triumph. Afterward Russell commented, "" We have an experienced squad that knows how to win,""  and added, "" this is the first year we ve come here as the odds-on favorite, and I think the players handled it well. The Bisons reached the finals by exploding for nine goals m the fourth quarter of their semifinal match with host Fordham to turn an 8-5 advantage into a 17-6 win. . . __ Fordham is one of Bucknell's traditional water polo rivals, and even though the Bisons had defeated the Rams twice already this year, they game will be how well they switch off on our hole man (Tom Butler >82).""  And for three periods the Rams did a very effective job enacting ^TraUingtfy only three entering the fourth quarter, Fordham sudden ly came alive when spurred on by their boisterous fans. Time and again Fordham assaulted the Bison net, yetPaxton was equal to each task with arm and legs flailing mightily to reject every charge. At the other end of the pool, the Bisons were driving hard and their lead started to build. First Schulte, the University's career scoring leader with 574 goals, tallied followed by Gensheimer, Butler, Mrac Corl '81 and Weiman. Soon the Bisons were scoring almost_as fastas the Rams could put the ball in play following a Bucknell score. The final 17-6 verdict was reflective of the Bisons domination. Saturday morning's opening game against Washington and Lee proved virtually a shooting gallery for the Bisons. Schulte scored just 17 seconds into the game and wound up connecting on nine of 10' Shots for the contest and Butler dished out eight assists as Bucknell rolled to a 28-2 demolition of their outclassed opponents.

"Herd clouts Boston University, 30-17","By STEVEN SKOLNICK and MICHAEL SUAREZ The Bison locker room after last Satur day's game was the scene of a wild celebration. The gridders had just ended their season with a stunning 30-17 thrashing of Boston University, who came into the game as the ECAC Division I-AA's fourth ranked team with an 8-1 record. Head Coach Bob Curtis, standing on a bench, told his players, "" I'm more proud of this team than any team I've coached in the past. I am as proud as can be."" The upset victory, achieved by an in spired second half effort, gave the Bisons (6-4) their first winning season since 1975's 5-4 ledger. The Herd faced a difficult challenge in trying to defeat the high-scoring Terriers but found themselves in a 3-3 deadlock at halftime. The Bisons' points came on a 40- yard field goal from Alvin Depew '81. Curtis, commenting on the unyielding Bucknell defense in the first half, said, "" The Bison defense plays by the 'Bend but don't break' theory. They know the other guy will only get so far before they stop him."" Poor execution by Bucknell gave Boston University a 10-3 edge early in the second half. Defensive tackle Bill Goldsmith pounced on a loose ball in the endzone after quarterback A1 Locey '83 tossed a pitchout over the head of fullback Marshall Hall '83 deep in Bison territory. When safety Jim Gush '81 picked off a Jim Jensen aerial and returned it 44 yards to the Terrier 25-yard line two series later, the Herd had the break they needed to get their offense untracked. Wide receiver Dave Kucera '84 ran 10 yards to the one-yard line on a reverse around right end to set up a Hall touchdown blast to even the contest at 10- 10"
.,
Fullback Marshall Hall '83 plunges over Boston University defenders for the,"The offense was called back into action almost immediately when linebacker Ken Durr '82 intercepted another Jensen pass and returned it 12 yards to the Terrier 18. Halfback Ken Jenkins '82 accounted for 11 of the remaining yards on a weak side sweep and three plays later Locey hit paydirt on a quarterback sneak from the one. Depew's conversion was successful and the Bisons were ahead for good at 17- 10 . Faced with a third-and-15 from their own 26-yard line on their next possession, Cur tis called for the '134 counter special,' a trap play to Jenkins. Jenkins followed a block from right tackle Mike McDonald '80 up the middle, then cut to the open right sideline and brought the crowd to its feet with a 74-yard scoring burst. The Herd's margin showed 23-10 when Depew's con version failed. The touchdown was Jenkins' 15th of the season, breaking the University single season record. A 40-yard Jensen to Scott Phinney com pletion set up a one-yard plunge by Gregg Drew to close the gap to 23-17 with over five minutes remaining. However, Jenkins put the final touch on another stellar in- l"
first Bison touchdown Saturday,"dividual performance by charging 18 yards for a score with but 51 seconds left to bring the final tally to 30-17. Jenkins, who rushed 26 times for 191 yards, established Bucknell single season records for carries (213), rushing yards (1,270) and touchdowns (16). Jenkins also broke the NCAA Division I-AA record for all-purpose yards with 1,884, eclipsing by 78 yards the mark of Nevada-Reno's Frank Hawkins set last season. The tenacious defensive front of seniors Bruce Keltie, Dave Mann, Peter Mauritz, . and Dave Hibbard limited Boston's ground See FOOTBALL, page 14"

Guard Carl Cosimano '84 drives toward the Portugal basket In,
Friday's exhibition game. Thirteen Bison players saw action as,
the cagers staged a late rally for an opening-game draw.,"By JEFF CROSS A basketball game ends in a tie about as often as All-American candidate A1 Leslie '81 misses a slam dunk. Well, the Breakin' Bisons' 1980 debut last Fri day night against the National team of Portugal ended in a 74-74 deadlock, much to the dismay of both Bucknell players and fans. After the cagers staged a spirited comeback to pull even with Portugal as regulation time expired, the rowdy assemblage in Davis Gym grew increas ingly boisterous in anticipation of an exciting over time period. However, the fans were left disap pointed when Portugal Coach Adriana Baganha ex ercised his right, under the international rules in ef fect for the exhibition, to decline to play to a conclu sion and instead settled for a draw. Bison Head Coach Charlie Woollum commented, "" We would definitely have liked to have played overtime,"" but added "" the result is not important. Our goal was to play everyone on our team.""  Leslie echoed his coach's sentiments, saying "" The score wasn't as important as what we wanted to get out of it,"" and added,""  Overall, we were pleased."" After trailing for much of the second half, the Bisons began a furious rally from a 72-66 deficit in the final two minutes. Freshman guard Carl Cosimano was the spark, converting first on a breakaway layup and then on a running jump shot from the foul line to narrow the gap to 72-70 with 1:12 showing on the clock. Single Portugal free throws surrounding a Mike Page '81 lay in left the Bisons two points shy with 30 seconds left and set up a dramatic ending. With just 15 seconds left, guard Jay Wright '83 made a steal near midcourt and raced to the top of the key where he pulled up for a jump shot. His shot was short, bouncing high off the front of the rim, but suddenly Leslie appeared and skyrocketed above the rim to slam home the rebound and cause a crescendo of cheers to descend from the bleachers. However, an official's whistle pierced the crowd's roar: Wright had been fouled on his shot and Leslie's tying basket was nullified. BUCKNELL (74) Leslie 6 1-113, Shehadi 6 0-0 12, Okorodudu 3 1-3 7, Page 5 2-212, Moss 3 0-0 6, Adkins 0 2-3 2, Cody 12-3 4, Cosimano 3 0- 0 6, Harrison 10-0 2, McGregor 0 2-2 2, Rizzo 0 0-00, Vullo 2 0- 0 4, Wright 0 4-5 4.

Wright remembered "" I was just thinking of having good form""  and "" putting everthing out of my mind."" Calmly, Wright swished the first two shots of the three-and-two situation to draw the Bisons even at 74 all. A swarming Bucknell defense prevented Por tugal from attempting a game-winning shot in the closing seconds and the buzzer signalled the first tie in University basketball history. Although Bucknell "" didn't prepare for Portugal at all"" according to Woollum, the Breakin' Bisons connected on their first four shots and jumped to a 12-2 advantage within three minutes. Woollum said, "" I wouldn't have tried to kill, them if we could have.""  He need not have worried, though, as Por tugal used aggressive offensive rebounding to go on a 20-3 spurt to take a 22-15 lead as Woollum substituted freely. Leslie commented. "" Maybe it was bad for us to get up (by 12-2) that fast."" He added, "" If we get into that situation again, we'U know how to handle it better."" There was little excitement in the remaining por tion of the first half which ended with the Bisons holding a 35-34 advantage. Guard Dave Shehadi '81 led Bison scorers with 10 points and Leslie had eight. 1 Portugal led for most of the second half, using a tough defense to force numerous Bucknell turn overs and poor shot selection.

Congress call fo r,
a reduced budget,"By SUSAN MACDONALD and MATT KARANIAN Rejecting the University's cur rent proposals for budget guidelines as too high and the faculty's call for a 15 percent wage and salary hike as too much, the ABS Congress voted unanimously Monday to ask the University Board of Trustees for a lower tuition and fees increase than those now anticipated. Vice President for Administra tion and Finance John Zeller -- appearing as a guest of the con gress in its last session of the semester - explained the University's current plan for a rise of between $1000 and $1115, calling such large tuition in creases "" shocking."" He nevertheless said that rises of such magnitude were necessary and inevitab e. The school's budget of $27 million will have to increase by $2.7 million to account for an inflation rate ex pected to be about 10 percent, Zeller said. "" The only real source of big dollars to make up that incre ment is through tuition,"" he said. The vice president came to the meeting to present both the lOth and 11th set of budget guidelines, explaining that the first nine have all been rejected for various reasons. The 10th calls for a 9% percent across-the-board wage and salary raise for faculty and a $1000 tuition rise as a result. The 11th plan--a version un balanced by slightly more than $93,000 that the faculty gave its support to in their meeting Mon day--would give professors and staff a 12% percent raise and would require a tuition and fees total of $1115. , Both proposals allow for a 3 See STUDENTS, page 9"

Recycling dispute acted upon,
C* ommittee recommends return of funds to ^roup,
K,j
U I I I I I U I I W,"^ j  j Doms said a new problem has surfaced By DAVID O'CONNELL The University Committee on Com plementary Activities is preparing a set of recommendations designed to resolve the controversy about the control of $4,633 in Recycling Group funds presently locked in a bank account by Professor of Mechanical Engineering Charles Coder, the club's former advisor. The club petitioned the ABS Oct. 13 to have the committee examine the problepi. According to Bob Doms '81, president of the Recycling Group, the funds should be used for expansion of the club's program. Coder has maintained that the original intent of the group was to set the funds aside for a scholarship fund for local high school students. After a review conducted at meetings of the committee Nov. 6 and Nov. 20, three proposals were tentatively agreed upon at a meeting Tuesday. They will be presented to the President's staff for consideration, according to Bill Thum '82, chairman of the committee. First, the committee plans to recom mend that, in general, funds belong to the organization, and are not under the control of the advisor, who should act in a "" mechanical""  role to oversee fund usage, Thum said. second, he said the committee is re questing that Coder and Doms agree to have the funds placed in a student account fund rather than in the present savings ac count -- which is outside the normal University auditing system. Thum said also that the committee will ask that theRecycling Group be advised to use the funds for a scholarship if possible. "" It's important to realize that any such recommendation would not be binding,"" Thum said. "" Our recommendations resulted from the fact that there was never a formal binding agreement made on what the funds should be used for, based on the evidence presented,""  Thum said. He said that in the Nov. 20 meeting the committee was advised by Vice President for Ad ministration and Finance John Zeller that there are no legal principles involved. Zeller said at the meeting that "" if a club acts against the advisor's wishes, then the advisor can resign,""  and that "" the continu ing membership should decide upon finan cial goals of a club unless a trust fund for a specific purpose is set up."" The committee formulated the recom mendations Tuesday, but -- because there was not a quorum present, Thum said -- the proposal will be mailed to committee members for official action in the near future. regarding how the funds should be spent. "" For the last two years that Professor Coder was our advisor, he handled our finances, and it seems that he was very neglectful in failing to pay at least $1,500 in unpaid bills."" . Doms said he was "" rudely surprised when he learned of the unpaid bills earlier this semester from University Controller Ellis Harley, but that Coder's failure to pay was probably due to his gradually decreasing involvement with the club. Harley confirmed the outstanding liabilities -- which he said currently amount to $1506 -  but he noted that since the assets in the bank account and the liabilities were both within the Universi ty's accounting system, no real problem existed. Doms said the group should have full control over the money remaining after the debt is paid. "" We don't have anything against Coder personally -- he did a lot to get the group started,""  he said. "" It's just that we feel that a past advisor shouldn't dictate what we should do."" When reached for comment Wednesday, Coder said he had not heard anything regarding the committee's investigation into the matter. He said he still maintains that the funds be used for scholarship pur poses, but added that if Zeller told him to,"
BOB DOMS,"he would "" of course""  release the funds. Coder had no further comment on the matter, including the unpaid bills, and in sisted that he had not been informed about the investigation except for one written re quest from Thum for pertinent documents which he "" hasn't had time to honor."" Thum said he has "" repeatedly tried to keep Coder informed""  through campus mail and office visits, but has been unsuc cessful in contacting him. Doms said that "" just because the com mittee has recommended that Coder release control of the funds doesn t mean we're out of the woods. If he refuses to cooperate, it could be a messy situation."""

Course provides experience,
in managing and organizing,' :<<<ff Photo-- John Staudinger
COLEMAN HALL BREAKFAST,"--  A. M. Eatables, one of the student projects of Professor of Management John Miller s introductory management course, sells coffee and donuts to students before morning classes Nov. 17, 19 and 21. ByERICHOERNER Learning to organize and manage an organization is "" an absolutely fundamental requirement of a liberal education,""  according to John Miller, head and professor of management. This is one of the primary goals of Miller s In troduction to Organization and Management course. A substantial part of the course work in cludes a group project which "" must reflect (the classes' ) commitment to respond to a clear need in the community,"" according to Miller. In addition to providing students with a sense of how an organization runs, Miller said he has two other goals for the students in Management 101. First, he wants the students to learn what managers do and who they are. "" The students should learn how the key institutions of our society operate, Miller added. k . . .. . The final objective is for the students to begin to appreciate the theoretical and research problems that belong in the discipline of organization and management, Miller said. According to Miller, the theoretical approach to management is "" too distant from anything that's real,"" when taught by itself. Several groups continued their projects after the course ended. "" The finals week survival kit group went into business for themselves,"" he said. This semester there were five projects conducted by Management 101 students: Casa La Italiano, Cami Days, "" The Bike Race,"" A.M. Eatables, and The Bucknell Safety Bureau. Approximately 250 students take the course each semester. The class is separated into five recitation sections and each of the sections is required to com plete a class project. T he Italian dinner p r o j e c t --Casa La Italiano--held in Larison Hall November 9, raised for the Sunflower Day Care Center in Lewisburg, according to group president Mark Everett '81. Another group distributed over 800 carnations to rooms around campus on Cami Day, November 15. The flowers had been ordered during a sales cam paign the previous two weeks. According to dinner committee chairman Rob Tyrrell '84, part of the proceeds will be used to fund a dinner, hosted by the Cami Day group, for children from the Laurelton State Center. The remaining funds will be donated to the center, Tyrrell said. "" The Bike Race"" was also held November 15. Chris Hlavaty '84, secretary of the Bike Race group, said 13 teams paid a $10 entry fee. According to the class personnel administration manager, Dawn Sanderson '82, the group raised $125 which will be divided evenly between the United Methodist Home in Lewisburg and the Sunflower Day Care Center. A.M. Eatables was held November 17, 19 and 21 from 7 to 9 a.m. in Coleman Hall, Olin Science and Dana Engineering buildings. Group president Chris Kueffner '83, said the group sold coffee and donuts to faculty and students who did not have time for breakfast before class. Kueffner said the proceeds from the project will be given to a fund to support future Management 101 projects. The Bucknell Safety Bureau conducted a bicycle, traffic and sports safety clinic in Davis Gym, November 22, for third, fourth, and fifth grade students from Lewisburg schools. According to Steve Vuolo '84, director of operations for the bureau, this is a direct service and funding has been provided by local merchants. Miller said he began teaching a similar course on the graduate level fifteen years ago at the Universi ty of Rochester. He said he refined the course while teaming undergraduates at Yale University and while conducting workshops for practicing managers. "" Bucknell students will be called on all their lives to organize and manage things, from PTA to formal business organizations. They must know what it takes to accomplish goals,"" Miller said. "" How liberated can you be if you don't know how to accomplish your own goals?"" Miller concluded."
Area water shortage is not a problem on campus,"__ . . . . .  > v-i i o lln n n n O  u r a f p r  t il 1*1111 By LYNNE RUTHERFORD The current water shortage ex isting throughout eastern and central Pennsylvania has so far had no effect upon the campus water supply, according to John Bell, director of the Physical Plant. "" We have no plans to call a water emergency,""  Bell said. Keystone Water Company of Milton, which who controls the University's water supply, is not taking any action to regulate water supply-other than calling for increased conservation. The company said the recent snow has helped and they view the situation as stable, according to Bell."

THIS YEAR,
FOSS,
Jewelers,""" The recent rains and snows have helped a bit, but conserva tion measures are always a good thing,"" Robert Naugle, assistant director of the Physical Plant, said. Gov. Richard Thornburgh pro claimed on Nov. 19 that a severe shortage existed in central and eastern portions of the state. The Union County Department of Emergency Services, in response to the governor's address, urged voluntary conservation in an ef fort to avert rationing. Unlike Union County, several dozen area communities have begun mandatory water ration ing regulations. The counties have established daily water allocations of 30 to 40 gallons per person per day. These counties include Montour, Northumber land, Snyder and Union. In compliance with the Union County guidelines, students are urged to take showers rather than baths and to limit their showering time to three minutes. They should also refrain from allowing water to run while shav ing or while brushing their teeth. Although the situation remains stable water company officials expressed concern that a slow deterioration of the water supply will cause more suppliers to make rationing mandatory. "" Unless we get a substantial rainfall, the situation is going to continue to be more and more severe,"" according to Larry Welfer, supervisor of the State Department Of Environmental Resources."

A decision was made that day by the Executive Committee of Concern and Action -- the University's principal student service organization -- to review the content of the semi-annual weekends the group has orga nized for the last 13 years. phasis of the retreats is "" Per sonal Development,"" something Kushner said was not stressed enough here. "" It would include things like social interaction, dating, the fam ily, careers, how to handle criticism , and com munication,""  he said. The retreats are still in the ear ly planning stages, although Kushner said the first would pro bably be held Feb. 20 and 21. H am m erlee described the retreats as "" 24 hour experiences with speakers or someone with something to share."" Since the conference center can accommodate up to 70 people, the retreats would be geared to a smaller number of people than the colloquies were. Hammerlee said that the format would pro bably include registration in ad vance with a small charge for the food. "" Total cost of the retreats could range anywhere from $10 to $400,""  said Hammerlee, as op posed to "" the average fall collo quy of about $4000 and the spring colloquy at $2500.""  The difference in costs would allow CA to spon sor more retreats covering a wide range of topics. Photo-- Hilary Schwab"

Canadian exchange proposed,
by small faculty group here,"By MARC ELLIOTT A small group of University faculty is hoping to institute an exchange program with Cana da's Carleton University next year, to foster a program in Canadian studies. If the proposed program is im plemented, the University would join the ranks of an elite group of institutions which sponsor pro grams in Canadian studies -- among them Yale, Harvard, Duke, Rochester and Johns Hopkins Universities. According to Associate Pro fessor of Economics Peter Kresl, the idea of exchanging faculty and students with a Canadian university is not a new one, nor is faculty and student interest in Canada a recent phenomenon. "" There have been six or seven Jan Plans to Canada in the past nine years,""  Kresl said, adding that many Canadians partici pated in Spring Colloquy here three years ago. A recent grant from a University trustee has also been allocated to support ef forts to attract more Canadian lecturers here. Kresl, the leader of these ef forts, likened the process of organizing the program to the consolidation of the International Relations major here. Currently, four departments -- economics, French, geography, and socio logy -- offer six courses which"

There are several benefits to be incurred with a faculty exchange, Kresl said. Bucknell would receive the services of experts in their respective areas of Cana dian studies. It might also be possible to schedule exchanges to place the Carleton faculty members in positions left tem porarily vacant by University faculty members on sabbatical, Kresl said.

Carleton has a student enroll ment of 14,000 and employs 650 faculty members teaching undergraduate and graduate study programs.

"AFSCME, Teamsters, cool efforts as support wanes","By MATT KARANIAN In contrast to the frenzied union and counterunion ac tivity here as recently as two years ago, the organization debate among non-professionals, union leaders and the administration appears to have ground to a halt. Most employees contacted in the physical plant and din ing service -- those workers who have been the target of union organizers in the past -- said they are "" satisfied"" with their jobs and with the wages they are earning. Although a few non-professionals here dissented, even the dissatisfied reported they would not be sympathetic to attempts by union leaders to organize them and to serve as their collective bargaining agent. And apparently in response to these attitudes, union organizers have ceased active efforts here. William Fogle, staff representative for the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) said Thursday he is "" not actively pursuing"" organizational efforts."
Suarez defeats Thum,
in second ABS election,"He said he would not "" solicit"" support at the University, but said that if he received inquiries, he would "" check them out."" Fogle added that although he has had "" some"" responses from the University's non-professional employees, it has been "" nothing to get excited about."" Likewise, the Teamsters, who have been involved in organizational efforts here also, but to a much lesssr degree than AFSCME, have not planned "" anything definite right at this time,"" according to Business Representative Organizer Robert Johnson. Although Johnson said Thursday the Teamsters would "" proceed on organizing""  and eventually "" follow up on group meetings,""  the union has yet to hold an organiza tional meeting here, and has not sent mailing<< to employees since August. One employee of the dining service who asked not to be named said although she was ""not satisfied with the wages,""  and "" feels cheated,""  she would not favor unioniz ing. She said if she could get her problems solved "" without the union""  it would be "" better.""  She said she is "" always hopeful,"" but refused to identify herself because she said the administrators "" can make it rough for you.""  She add ed "" nobody here seems to be interested in the union."" Bob Hoyer, also a dining service employee, said he was "" not satisfied""  with his wages, but added he did not "" know if a union would help."" Physical Plant employee Ed Lech disagreed, however He said "" wages could be better,""  and that he would sui> port a union ' 'jf they could help us. "" Several other Physical Plant workers said they were "" satisfied,""  however, with one adding "" it's not bad here."" He said, "" you just do your job and be done with it.""  Regar ding support for a collective bargaining agent, he said "" nobody expresses their feelings. Everyone keeps to himself."" Another employee said union activity is something that is "" never discussed. We never think to talk,"" he said. "" As far as we know, the issue's dead."" From ELECTIONS, page 1 distributing other campaign m aterials through resident assistants and under dormitory room doors, according to the complaints. Dzurinko said, in a carefully- worded statement, however, that an ABS official study of the elec tion -- before the decision was made to have a new vote -- revealed "" no ill intent by either candidate"" and that the viola tions "" were a result of the actions that reflected the intense feelings of supporters on both sides."" "" Because the election vote was close,"" the statement said, "" it is indeterminable whether these violations swayed the election."" The ABS investigation consisted of interviews with both can didates and several resident assistants and residence direc tors and the review and checking of the facts in all the formally- lodged complaints. "" I think that it was better to clarify the question, rather than allow the election to have been cast in doubt,"" Dzurinko said, ad ding that the ABS decision "" was the most just alternative--we had to do it."" Suarez said Wednesday that "" The second election made the first election a travesty,"" and that it "" harmed the images of both candidates and the ABS."" "" The voters who turned out for the election w ere cheated because they took the time and effort to go to the polls and their vote meant little or nothing,"" Suarez said. Thum said after his defeat Thursday night that "" The ABS handled the election very well,"" adding that he is "" sure (Suarez) will do a great job."" The contesting of the presiden tial election by the ABS Steering Committee did not effect the other results of the election held the Tuesday before Thanksgiv ing. In the most hotly contested of the other steering committee races, junior Andy Brody defeated freshman Dan Huck by 60 votes for treasurer. Missy Campbell '82 easily defeated Bill Walz '82, 538 to 353 for the second spot in the student government heirarchy, and Lon Castle won an uncontested race for ABS secretary with more than 90 percent of the vote. After learning of his victory, Suarez said Thursday he does not want to "" dwell on the election, but to get straight to work. Everyone in the ABS Congress will have to work together in order to be more productive,"" Suarez said. Suarez said he plans to lay the groundwork for his administra tion by working with the new steering committee in January. "" I also want to work with the cur rent steering committee to learn from their mistakes and to b e n e f i t f r o m t h e i r a c complishments to make the new administration an even better one,"" Suarez said. Dzurinko said that "" our ex perience will assure that the new steering committee will get off to a good start,"" and that he is look ing forward to aiding Suarez in making the transition to the new administration.

Surveys show support for a fall break,
ABS finds 73 percent o f faculty supportive,"By DAVID GROSSMAN In a recent survey conducted by the ABS, faculty members indicated they are greatly in favor of the mid-semester break. The survey was distributed to the entire faculty body, and was responded to by 89 professors. It showed 65 of them -- approximately 73 percent -- in favor to the mid-term vacation. Twenty more facul ty were opposed to the vacation, and nine of those who answered had no comment on whether the break was worthwhile or not. Most of the faculty members in favor of the vaca tion felt that class attendance was the same as it usually is, and that it provided a "" psychological lift"" for students as well as themselves. This "" lift"" , as indicated in the questionnaire, creates "" op portunity for more productive academic endeavors.""  Most of these professors did not report that excessive absence or lax work attitudes developed from the break. On the other hand, faculty members who opposed the vacation reported their attendance to have either been slightly or unacceptably off immediate ly before and after the break, and that valuable class days were lost. Some of these professors thought that instead of observing a fall break, a full week recess should be scheduled at Thanksgiving. Several of the faculty members who answered the survey elaborated on their essentially "" yes and no"" responses. One professor said, "" The break is essen tial. By the third week of October, everybody is suf fering from the relentlessness of study and work. This year's bit of refreshment has already shown in improved work."" Another respondent said "" Attendance was dismal! Class program was seriously disrupted for several days."" Others who commented praised the opportunity that everyone was given to breathe dur ing the break, and also felt that the break takes away invaluable class time by cutting down on scheduled class days. Another survery has been distributed to faculty by Joseph La Barge, Chairperson of the Committee on Instruction. The questionnaire asks only those professors who experienced severe decrease in at tendance before and after the vacation period to respond. They are requested to include their name, the class, the number of students enrolled in the class, and the number of absences in a given day."

Faculty poll produces six complaints,"By DAVID GROSSMAN In a survey distributed by Head Professor and Associate of Religion Joseph LaBarge, Chairman of the University Committee on Instruc tion, only six faculty members reported a significant amount of absences during the two class days before and after the midsemester break. According to the memorandum, only violations of academic com mitment "" by a significant number of students"" needed to be reported. However, LaBarge said some of the responding faculty members reported absence rates that were somewhat less significant LaBarge said, "" most of the complaints that I received involved large numbers of absentees during Friday (afternoon) classes."" Reports of poor attendance the two days following the vacation were less frequent. When the faculty passed an amendment against cancellation of classes to supplement the fall break proposal, they "" determined that the continuation of any fall break will be contingent upon both faculty and students honoring their respective academic commitments."" This stipulation largely created the motive for LaBarge's survey, as the purpose of the memorandum was to enable faculty members to report blatant abuses to the vacation privilege, LaBarge said. In turn, the amount and intensity of responses that LaBarge re ceived would influence to any suggestions he or his committee will make. Because of the few complaints he received, and also because of the several positive responses cultivated by the ABS survey, LaBarge said he plans to voice his support for the continuation of the mid semester break at the next faculty meeting."
Leadership fraternity,
announces 13 members,"Omicron Delta Kappa, a national leadership honor society, has an nounced the acceptance of 13 new members to its chapter here. This semester's inductees are Pam Ecock '82, Kathy Kelley '82, Anne Kennedy '82, David O'Connell '82, Susan Roth '81, Joe Ruszkiewicz '82, Beth Sipple '82, Dave Stewart '81, John Stillman '81, Michael Suarez '82, Scott Thistle '82, Bill Thum '82 and Ken Wolckenhauer '82. The society sends out invitations to apply for membership each semester to the top 35 percent of the junior and senior classes, based on cumulative GPA. Those applying were asked to indicate leadership experience in five categories: scholarship, social and religious ac tivities, creative and performing arts, journalism and mass media, and athletics. More than 100 applicants responded to the invitations, according to David Polsky '81, president of the local circle. The 13 new members were chosen by the current membership after several weeks of deliberation. Omicron Delta Kappa's most recent activity here was the spon sorship of ex-Bucknell professor Stuart Rothenberg's lecture on the rise of conservatism, held here on Nov. 17."

Tuition rise of $1115 foreseen,
if faculty gets salary demands,#
#i,Photo--Carl Jensen
HERE WE GROW AGAIN,
-  Work on the University's computer center project is continumg,
since completion of the Sports/Recreotion Complex in,1978.
Students now ask for lower tuition,"From TUITION, page 1 The motion was actually a for mal endorsement of the monthly report of the University Commit tee on Planning and Budget as delivered by Assistant Professor of Physics Stephen Becker, who has been leading the fight in the faculty for higher wages since 1978. In making the motion to en dorse the report calling for a 15 percent salary hike, Chairman and Associate Professor of Political Science John Peeler ac cused the trustees of "" holding out for the minimum"" salary in crease possible and "" daring the faculty to ask for more."" The statement prompted a heated exchange between Peeler and University President Dennis O'Brien in front of the 140 faculty who nearly filled the University Center Forum and comprised the largest body of faculty to gather for a monthly meeting since the salary debate a year ago. "" I don't think it's fair to at tribute ill-will to the trustees,"" O'Brien said. "" Students want less and the faculty wants more. Both are legitimate, and these people are just trying to do what is best for the University,""  he said. O'Brien pledged, however, to "" make the best case possible for the highest salary increase possi ble""  when the board meets today and Saturday and when the final decision is made by the trustees' Executive Committee sometime within the next two months. "" We're all looking for a posi tion to live with,""  the president said, but he added he would not ask the trustees to commit the University to raising its wages parallel to any economic index, as many faculty have suggested. After approving the Planning and Budget Committee's report, the faculty began discussion of the report of the Personnel Com mittee on the plans for allocating the 3 percent merit increase the faculty had asked for, although there was sharp division among the faculty about support for the committee's plan. A various number of altera tions to the report by the Person nel Committee were proposed and discussed. From STUDENTS, page 1 percent merit increase. Saying that "" last year we got stung,"" Zeller said the economy is often too variable to predict ac curately. Wages and salaries went up 8 percent and tuition nine in the last year, but inflation finished in the teens, and the faculty's request for a much big ger increase in wages is to make up for that discrepancy. Guidelines 10 and 11 will both be discussed by the Finance Com mittee of the board today, but they are almost certain to refer it to the trustees' Executive Com mittee for final action in late January or early February, when Zeller said "" the economy will be easier to predict."" "" No one knows what the economy will be like 19 months from now,""  he said, "" and so we have to tend to be conservative."" ABS President John Dzurinko '81--in his last meeting as chair man of the congress -- question ed the University's policy of only using 5 percent of the return on its investment portfolio each year, asking if the trustees would be willing to raise the percentage to deviate the burden placed on tuition income. "" The managers will always put safety first and growth second in a risk framework like ours, and so they will invest prudently,"" Zeller said. The average total return on the University's in vestments last year kept pace with inflation at 13 percent, he said. Zeller told the audience at the meeting--a group of 40 drastical ly smaller than the hundreds who have packed the meetings in the past two years--that Bucknell is not pricing itself out of the com petitive college market. trustees later voted to raise tui tion by only $575. Last year, the congress also endorsed the $650 tuition and fees increase, although at that time they sent the trustees "" stipulations""  for their endorsement that were not formally acted on by the board."

Insider's Guide'story on Bucknell,
is critical of student body values here,
"From INSIDER'S GUIDE, page 1",
Co-editor Klein said it was he who spoke to Levine and,
"disputed Levine's statement that ""most of what's there",
"is mine.""",
"Klein said Levine ""is wrong. We did not use a lot of",
what he wrote in. He sent me a long review and we cut a,
"lot of it because it was personally biased."" Klein said,",
"however, that sentences were taken ""verbatim"" from",
"Levine's comments and he was the only one who ""con",
"tributed written remarks.""",
"Klein said he had ""a lot of input"" for the Bucknell",
review but not as much as he would have liked. He said,
that he telephoned three personal friends here and got,
information from them but refused to give their names.,
Co-editor Allen said she sent three of her friends who are,
students here questionnaires but got no response.,
Both Klein and Allen said they sent several question,
naires to the Bucknellian but received no responses.,
Allen said the Guide solicits college newspapers because,
"they ""provide the most literate response."" She said that",
the guide makes repeated mailings and phone calls to,
get a variety of responses and opinions.,
"Andy Marsh '81, Bucknellian editor during the fall of",
"1979, said he received a questionnaire but did not have",
time to respond and did not consider it a priority. He said,
he was satisfied with what had previously been written,
in the guide.,
Marsh said he did not know Levine responded to the,
Guide's inquiries,
"Allen said ""my goal was to have more than one person",
write the review and I did everything I could to avoid it.,
"But if the schools don't respond, we have to do the best",
"we can.""",
"She said it was ""possible,"" however, that a review",
"could consist mostly of one person's opinion. ""It's hap",
"pened,"" she said.",
"Klein, who according to both editors supervised the",
"Bucknell review, refuted Allen's statement. He said the",
staff did not depend on one person's opinion. He said,
"they ""paste together information"" and",
rewrite it.,
Klein said the staff tried to check the information given,
"them but added ""we can't do it all.""",
University Director of Admissions Richard Skelton,
"said he ""doesn't place a lot of stock in it"" (the Guide).",
"He said the publication has not ""requested any technical",
"information"" from his office, adding that ""they appear",
to take minor points and make them into major ones.,
He said his office has had no contact with the Guide,
"""inatleastlOyears.""",
Both Allen and Klein disagreed. Allen said she sent,
mailings to the admissions office here in February 1979,
"requesting statistics and received a reply. ""Someone in",
"that office took it upon himself to reply"" she said. Allen",
said she could not be sure who answered the inquiry but,
said it was on file in a storage vault of the Daily News,

Peddler,"against injustice, for example) that the conservative, limited student body specialized in groupthink and demands con formity. It tends to isolate individualists and independent personalities. Social life goes along the same lines. Parties consist mosUy of mobbed fraterni ty affairs (this year over seventy percent of the freshmen men joined fraternities) and doing as much damage to the brain cells as possible. Beer and pot top the list of favorite controlled substances (remember the Penn sylvania drinking age is twenty-one). Co caine and various forms of speed are next in order of appreciation. Even some of the most gung-ho ""animal house"" types admit they are a litUe bored of the same old frat parties, but that's just about all there is in the Central Susquehanna Valley, except for a flashy new disco called the Great Green Frog that opened last year in nearby Milton (home of Chef Boy-Ar- Dee). Sex? Well, the stereotype goes that a Bucknell girl thinks anything more than a that seems pretty much to be the case. But the student sex information group claims the yearly abortion rate is up in the hundreds. Neither of these extremes is particularly close to the truth, in all likelihood. But don't go looking to.Bucknell for a few years of pas sionate nights in bed, unless you plan on spending them alone. Moving around to the academic side, students In the sciences, and business and engineering majors work themselves into a frenzy of academic pressure. They work hard and are typically rewarded with good Jobs. Liberal arts majors can get by quite nicely with practically no work. The faculty is dedicated and brilliant, but largely wasted on students who don't care. Bucknell engineering is associated nation wide with prestige, and lots of it. Several psychology professors have national reputa tions for their work, although it appears that some of the most well known may be seeking positions elsewhere. Biology is also strong.

524-9244,"most loved teacher, known for his popular English course on Shakespeare. He Inter prets ""the Bard"" with a touch of historical relevance in addition to literary and psychological aspects, earning the deep respect of almost all his students. History's favorite is Britain specialist Mark Neuman. His classes and seminars take students far beyond the feared rote of chronological events and enter subtle and revealing aspects of England's culture, society, literature, and people. Neuman's Victorian and Edwardian offerings are par ticularly rewarding. The faculty recenUy approved a new inter national relations major, which promises to rise quickly to the forefront of education at Bucknell. This program features the juvenile antics of Tom Travis, who manages to convince bis students that he is brilliant. A semester's work with Travis should prove to be highly entertaining as well as in formative. Most of the other departments are satisfactory to excellent. Sociology is badly in need of some .strong professors and English professors should be chosen with care. (There is said to be a lot of tenured dead weight over In the English wing.) The business department is ii shambles, due to a high rate of professor turnover and dissatisfaction. The main problem at Bucknell is lack of student diversity. The admissions depart ment clearly strives to pick the Bucknell brand of student and so robs each enrolling class of one of the most important aspects of college life: getting to know different types of people. Some members of the college community go so far as to state that admissions policies discriminate against certain minority groups. But recent studies indicate that peo ple who see the Bucknell stereotype, and realize that they don't fit it, simply choose another school. Lewisburg's somewhat backward rural at mosphere may be refreshing to urban or suburban freshmen, but the glow of wholesome countryside soons wears off when they realize that they are noplace -- In the middle of nowhere. The town offers a movie theater, a car wash, and the campus bowling alley and bar -- locally known as Dunkle's. Penn State is the only notable school nearby, one hour to the west. One of Bucknell's Outstanding qualities is its campus. The nickname ""Country Club on the Susquehanna"" is not unearned. The Georgian buildings and perfect grounds are kept in top condition. A multi-million dollar field house is the latest addition to campus facilities. Indoor tennis, Jogging, racquetball, and other sports are available here. But faculty members and the more astute students notice that Bucknell decided it needed a new gym before a life-sciences building, a theater, or a music and arts center. Of course.

Dzurinko reflects on ABS,
upon retirement as president,"By TRICIA KENNEDY Do students here have a responsibility to be involved in student government? The answer, according to retir ing Association of Bucknell Students P r e s i d e n t John Dzurinko '81 is an emphatic "" Yes."" "" Bucknell is our institution and we (the students) should actively participate to make it ours,"" Dzurinko said, adding, "" We must Dzurinko defined the student con gress as a "" discussion - oriented"" group. Its function, he said, is to debate certain issues and to voice specific student reactions to University proposals. Dzurinko named the approval of recycling as a University policy and the drafting of a specific program for the third floor of the University Center as two of the major accom - traditional study can be just as "" meaningful and important""  as traditional study and can in fact "" enrich"" the traditional cur riculum. Pete Francino '81, current vice - president of the ABS, said Dzurinko "" has been frustrated in achieving his goals because of the students' attitudes, and because of what they value. They don't desire the kind of complete education John is talking about."""
NEWSMAKERS,"be willing to work on issues that are of concern to us."" Dzurinko criticized students here for their lack of interest in affecting change in University policy. There is concern that students with career goals have directed their sense of respon sibility away from the larger view of University life toward merely fulfilling their curriculum requirem ents, according to Dzurinko. He cited the low turn-out of 40 students at Monday' s"
ABS,"meeting to discuss the 1981-82 tui tion increase as an example of growing student apathy here. "" The ABS cannot deal with such issues effectively if students don't show a real interest,"" Dzurinko said. Answering charges that the"

His plan last winter to make a "" p r a c t ic a l application of academics to community work"" was criticized in a Feb. 22 Bucknellian editorial as being "" an alarming departure"" from the traditional campus - oriented concerns of student government. More recently, Dzurinko's pro posal for course credits to the ABS president and to certain other student leaders drew criticism. "" People are scared of muddy ing the distinction between cur ricular and extracurricular ac tivities,"" Dzurinko said, in answer to criticisms of both pro posals. He stressed that non- Dean of Student Affairs John Dunlop, the ABS advisor, char acterized Dzurinko as some one "" who believes strongly in student government, and has done his best to help the ABS find what its proper role should be."" Dzurinko, formerly the presi dent of the student body at M o n e s s e n H i g h S c h o o l , Monessen, Pa., has been active in student organizations in his seven semesters here.

Josef Klasa, head of the Cen tral Committee Department for Relations with the media in Poland, said Thursday, however, that the Polish leadership might ask for Soviet assistance if socialism became endangered there. He announced at a news con ference in Warsaw that the USSR might be called in if "" authority slipped into the hands of anti socialist elements."" The White House said Tuesday it would be a mistake to assume the United States ""lacks the will or ability to respond appropriate ly"" to Soviet aggression in Poland during President Carter's lame duck administration."

College admissions,

The Fam ily E ducational Rights and Privacy Act of 1975 granted matriculated students access to their admission files, but colleges are permitted to ask students to waive their right of access to specific documents. Colleges have routinely re quested applicants to waive their right of access to letters of recommendation. Such requests now appear to have developed into a nationwide trend. Admission officers on a dozen college campuses have reported to the New York Times that they believed the waivers were necessary to assure frankness on the part of teachers and others writing the students' recommendations. Bucknell includes a waiver statement for applicants for ad mission to the University."

According to a report in the Hartford Courant, although cancer of the liver can somtimes be treated, experts agree it is usually incurable. Its sources reported that only a few people live as long as one year with any kind of liver cancer. Grasso, who was operated on for cancer of the ovary in April, was readmitted to Hartford Hospital Nov. 16 for treatment of phlebitis. The new cancer was discovered during routine testing Nov. 24.

The appeal to carry out the debate came from a lower court decision that declared male-only draft registration unconstitu tional. If the Supreme Court defends this position, Congress will have to decide whether to change the Military Selective Service Act to include women, or leave the country with an invalid rule for military installation. A decision that the existing separate treatment of men and women in military context is justified could make future defense of sex-based distinctions easier."

He did not rule out the possibili ty of a low-level depository being built in Pennsylvania, however. The NRC would like to store the wastes in the state's underground geological formations, but high water tables and the lack of suffi ciently wide mineral veins have hampered such plans.

Letter from the editor,
"Is that really you over there on the right? Well, the Insiders",
Guide to the Colleges thinks so -  or at least one former student who,
wrote to them and called us middle-class beer-drinking job hunters.,
"Unfortunately, he didn't say if he fit the same stereotype.",
If you don't know what I'm talking about then you didn t read the,
"article on the front page of this newspaper, and probably didn't read",
the excerpt from the book reprinted on page 10. But if you didn t read,
that,
you're probably not reading this so don't worry.,
Maybe that's part of the problem. If you're not reading your col,
lege newspaper and you don't go to a play or a lecture or an or,
chestra concert at least once in awhile then you're really wasting,
your time here and you may as well be taking a correspondence,
course at home for your B.A. or B.S. -- and maybe you should worry,
-- because you're wasting the money that you're trying to earn.,
I guess it's the grades that gets you that job. And it's probably,
"idealistic to think that it shouldn't be, but if plain schoolwork and",
good grades were everything then you wouldn't be reading this.,
"That's the point and if you still don't get it, the "" Y"" on that guy s",
chest over there might mean you.,
"It's been fun being Editor, but now my grades are hurting and I",
might not get that job.,
Transitions,
The end of a semester brings transitions of all types. From our,
"cozy basement offices, we can see the colors get bleaker and the",
"days get shorter as winter approaches outside, and on the inside we",
prepare for a new editor. These are the normal and methodic events,
of every December here in Lewisburg.,
The transition now underway within the organization of the ABS,
has been far less than methodic or normal. The first contested elec,
"tion since 1977 was lamentably contested in more ways than one,",
with opponents Suarez and Thum competing with enough overdone,
fervor to warrant a second -- and more civilized,
contest.,
"While the offensive campaign tactics are of course regrettable,",
the actions of the outgoing ABS steering committee are entirely,
"commendable. After reacting with a bit of bewildered surprise,",
"President John Dzurinko acted with careful, considered judgment to",
"ascertain the facts and orchestrate a quick, nonbiased solution. Far",
from demeaning the candidates and the ABS,
as the winner accus,
ed -- the president legitimized the potentially rancerous mess and,
provided a fitting tribute to the end of his yearlong tenure.,
Dzurinko has indeed come a long way since we first worried that,
"he might not "" remember his constituents"" after he succeeded Phil",
"Andrews last January. But John's soft, homespun ideology of",
"idealism has servedu s well, and it is his constituents who should now",
remember him.,
We of course wish Michael Suarez the best as he begins his tran,
sition into the chair. Given the apparent indiscretions of the past,
"week, it may be a hard transition; given the performance of John",
"Dzurinko, it may be a tough chair to fill.",
Redirected recycling,
"Professor Charles Coder has $4,633 of Recycling Group funds",
locked away in a local bank beyond the access of group members.,
He refuses to return the money to the group unless it is used for a,
scholarship for local high school students. The group has said it,
wants to use the funds to expand the club's program.,
Coder's control of the money dates back to when he was the,
"club's advisor. He no longer holds the position, but has never relin",
quished control of the funds.,
The University Committee on Complementary Activities is,
seeking to resolve the conflict and is making recommendations to,
bring the controversy to a conclusion.,
Chairman of the committee Bill Thum '82 said among the com,
mittee's non-binding recommendations will be one that the Recycl,
ing Group use the funds for scholarship if possible.,
We agree with this recommendation. The Recycling Group,
"should consider all possible uses for its funds, and should not merely",
grow for growth's sake. The group should also consider setting aside,
a percentage of its profits for endeavors such as Coder's proposed,
scholarship.,
But the decision is that of the group -- it's their money.,
"Coder's rationale may be benevolent and well-intended, but he is",
wrong in his tyrannical clutch of the funds. Coder's stubborn,
behavior is unbecoming of his profession. It's not his money.,

"Tastes, preferences &  criticisms?","* 11 i __ x ___1 _______ 1 _____ i << t p L . D .i< .lr n n llin n  K o c  n P A tn n o H To the Editor: We would like to point an ap p aren t d is c re p a n c y in Bucknellian policy. Although there is a page in each issue clearly marked "" Opinions,"" opi nions have not been confined to that section. The reviewers of music, theater and dance have repeatedly utilized the "" Arts"" space for articles expressing tastes, preferences and criticisms without labeling their comments as personal views. We hesitate to question their knowledge and credentials since we do not know their back grounds. However, we suspect that their insights are not suffi ciently educated or valuable to be informative. Reviews need not be the same as opinions or pointed criticisms. For example, in the Nov. 21,1980 issue, David Hawkings viewed the New Globe Theatre's Nov. 20 performance of "" The Glass Menagerie"" as "" sporadic,""  and called it "" bland and occasionally confusing."" Instead of berating the interpretation, which was ad mittedly not traditional, he might have objectively analyzed and at tempted to understand the ver sion. Alternatively, he might have made use of true profes sionals, including English and drama professors, in formulating his critical evaluation."
Continuing saga o f the,
Bucknell Chapel Choir,"To the Editor: As a college chaplain, I am keenly interested in ways to provide music for Sunday morning Chapel services. I remember fondly the well-sung anthems of the Bucknell Chapel Choir and its expert direc tion under Professor William D. McRae. Consequently, I was surpris ed to learn that since McRae's retirement, the choir no longer sings every Sunday and that the membership of the group has fallen away to a mere shadow of its former strength. Recent articles demand that President O'Brien study the current situation to determine what steps must be taken to insure a strong musical contribution to Bucknell's chapel program. The work of any chapel choir must be geared to the overall program of the Chapel ser vices. Clearly the new directions taken by the choir ignore the fun damental purposes for its existence. John W. Betlyon, Ph.D. (Bucknell, '71) Campus Minister Lycoming College, Williamsport, Pa. Nov. 20,1980"
The purpose of a news,
paper is to inform,"The Bucknellian has provided thorough coverage of the arts at Bucknell throughout the semester, and this support has surely helped promote interest and awareness of cultural events. A more constructive, responsi ble, professional approach would be worthy of such effort. Tanya Sorensen '81 Susan Dettbarn '81 Dec. 2,1980"
See the show,"To the Editor: We would like to offer thanks to all those who participated in the production of the Hulley House -- Tristram Art Show now on ex hibit outside the Forum in the U.C. There was an extraordinary amount of work demanded of those who assisted in the organization of the show and their efforts deserve to be recognized. Those extensive ef forts contributed to what we feel is an excellent and diverse selec tion of drawings, lithographs, paintings and photographs -- all created by Bucknell students. We encourage those who have neglected to see the exhibit to do so at the earliest opportunity, as it proves to be a pleasurable and inspiring experience. Alan Simpson '83 Danny Craven '82 Dec. 3,1980 To the Editor: I have been receiving the Bucknellian for two years and as the editor of another private col lege weekly newspaper I would like to com m ent on this semester's Bucknellian. Among the seven w eekly college newspapers that I read regularly, your newspaper has proven superior. Judging from several recent letters to the Editor, some Bucknellian readers do not ap preciate the relatively high quali ty of journalism that they read"

Credentials paramount,
in the Thomas decision,"To the Editor: The article, "" Rothenberg returns to campus in 'mainstream',"" (Bucknellian, November 21) states that "" the University hired Lin da Thomas to replace (Stuart Rothenberg) as an instructor of political science.""  This is erroneous. In fairness to everyone involv ed, including Ms. Thomas, Mr. Rothenberg and those of us who par ticipated in filling the vacancy in question, it should be noted that her appointment is a temporary one to replace regular members of the department who are on leave this academic year. Furthermore, I can state with confidence that Ms. Thomas' credentials in light of the qualifications listed in our advertised vacancy--and not her race or sex--were paramount in the depart mental recommendation that she be sought to fill that position. From what I have observed to date, I believe Professor Thomas has been well received by students at Bucknell. As a temporary member of our department, Mr. Rothenberg was highly valued. Several members of our staff worked con sistently for three years to help him find a permanent position at a school where his talents as a teacher could be utilized. It was discouraging to us, as well as to Professor Rothenberg, that this did not materialize. I am not privy to the "" type of satisfaction"" that Stuart Rothenberg still hopes to obtain from Buckenll (Bucknellian, November 21), but if what he seeks is consistent with the values and aims of higher education, then I hope he gets and'en- joys it.

Accept a little responsibility for the state of the world,"____ j i ___ iiohiiie mn. fk<<.r <<.ont aftor thp Trade- W e've been advised by parents, By TODD G. BUCHHOLZ Throughout the semester and especially before writing this final column, I 've been implored to stick with the funny stuff, and avoid writing about important and serious national and campus matters. Folks, there's just too much going on outside the dorms that we can't ignore. At this point, I 'm sure many are turning the page, disap pointed that I 'm not poking fun at the counseling service, the veg cooks, or freshmen. For those who want only frivolity, watch Mork and Mindy or attend a faculty meeting. People are afraid to be labelled as "" intellectuals""  fearing that they will lose their friends and be sentenced to hard labor in a library. But forget about IQ or SAT scores, we have a respon sibility -- to begin thinking as adult citizens. As cliche as it sounds, we are the next leaders of this country. And if we, the finer minds from the finer families, taught by the finer teachers, don't talk about the political, social and economic future of America, who will? Are we content to let the Moral Majority launch a crusade"
THE,
BUCH,
STOP,"to control us? In North Carolina a few weeks ago there was a trial. Nazis and Ku Klux Klan members were ac cused of murdering Communists. Regardless of the details, con sider that three groups, all of whom would rob us of our civil liberties are alive and organized. So what? "" They're all kooks with no power,""  you say. In the late 1920s the New York Times compared Hitler's supporters to a boy scout troop. They were kooks, too. In 1980, tell the Jews in France or blacks in Atlanta that kooks are powerless and no longer a threat. How many of you even know about the kidnappings and murders in Atlanta or terrorism in France? Of course, most Bucknellians are neither Jewish nor Black, so it doesn't matter, right? Pastor Martin Niemoller, the German theologian once said: "" First the Nazis went after the Jews, but I was not a Jew, so I did not object. Then they went after the Catholics, but I was not a Catholic, so I did not object. Then they went after the Trade- Unionists, but I was not a Trade- Unionist, so I did not object. Then they came after me, and there was no one left to object."" I don't expect students to cry whenever tragedy touches a human being. But we can accept a little more responsibility for the state of the world. Ever since we were young, we've been asked, "" What do you want to be when you grow up?"" We've been advised by parents, teachers and aunts how quickly our youth would pass, how soon we would become adults and make decisions that would deter mine our future. They were right. Jefferson gave Americans a choice bet ween vigilance and liberty or ig norance and tyranny. What do we want to be, now that we've grown up?"

'Messiah' comes to,
Bucknell for X-mas,"The University Chorale and Symphony Orchestra will present a sing-along performance of Handel's Messiah at 7:30 p.m. Sunday, December 14, in Rooke Chapel. "" The interesting thing about this production is that we're us ing Handel's original orchestra tion for the first time at Bucknell,"" Visiting Assistant Professor of Music Christopher McGahan said. "" The orchestra, therefore, will be smaller and sound different from what people are used to, but should be in teresting."" Last year the sing-in drew a crowd of about 400 people to Rooke Chapel, according to McGahan. "" It's great,""  he said. "" After all, choral music is getting groups of people together and sharing a communal experi- ence."" Soloists for the performance will be Lecturer in Music Martha Hill, soprano; Martha Zeller of Lewisburg, alto; Newton Gil christ, headmaster of a Phila delphia arts school, tenor. A bass soloist has yet to be found."
Entertainment park,
auditions musicians,"The management of Opryland U.S.A., a musical entertainment theme park in Nashville, Tenn., is conducting its yearly talent auditions for performers in the 14 musical productions to be staged during the 1981 season Singers, dancers, instrumen talists, pianists, conductors, specialty acts and bands are be ing sought to participate in the park's 10th anniversary celebra tion. The performances begin March 9 and run through the summer and fall to Nov. 1. Local auditions will be 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday at Drexel University, Philadelphia, and 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. Tuesday at the Pittsburgh Playhouse. The audi tion teams will run try-outs in 25 major cities around the country. For information on other dates and places contact the Opryland Entertainment Department at 615-889-6600."
University artworks,

The showing of 19th and 20th century American art was coor dinated by Susan Carr '81 as an independent study project. In cluded among the artists whose works will hang in the University Center's third floor museum is a former Bucknell professor, Blan chard Gummo, who taught here for 40 years. "" The main goal of this pro ject,"" Carr said, "" is to make peo ple more aware that Bucknell owns some art."" L'Agenda '80"

LONG and SHORT DRESSES FOR FORMALS,
ROMANTIC BLOUSES,
MITTENS,""" We're trying to make the two activities complementary rather than competitive,""  Ruth Bur nham, assistant director of stu dent activities, said. Burnham, working with James Hammerlee, director of student activities, is attempting to organize University Center ac tivities and place them under the direction of a proposed Weekend Program Committee. The committee's exact struc ture is still being debated, but would be comprised of students working on both the technical aspects of the activities and publicity. An overall manager, in charge of directing all programs, would be installed. A meeting was held Wednesday for students interested in working on the committee next semester. "" We're wide open to ideas that will make greater use of the gameroom, Walls Lounge, the Forum and other U.C. facilities,"" Burnham said. "" Eventually, we'd like not to be restricted to the U.C. The Sports/Recreation Complex and dormitories could i be used"
Candles and music,
to enlighten service,"Christmas brings many tradi tions -- caroling, wassail and wreaths to name a few. At Bucknell one of the ways the campus community celebrates the holiday season is through a candlelight service in Rooke Chapel. This year's Festival of Lessons and Carols will be conducted at 7:30 p.m. Sunday and Monday. The unique thing about the ser vices is that for the first time the University's three choral groups -- the Chapel Choir, University Chorale and Collegium Musicum -- will unite. The resultant per forming group will have about 100 members, according to Visiting Assistant Professor of Music Christopher McGahan -- who is arranging the service. "" It's important that the music department function as a depart ment. And what better time than Christmas?""  McGahan said. The service will consist of readings from the Old and New Testaments of the Bible with carols and choral pieces com menting on these readings. The vocal music will range from works of the Renaissance and Middle Ages to ones of the 20th century, including traditional carols. Also assisting in the musical of fering will be the University Brass Quartet. The service, though conducted with candles lit, will only depend fully on candlelight in a deeply moving moment at the very end of the Festival, according to McGahan."
BJRE to celebrate,
last day of classes,"The Bucknell Jazz and Rock Ensemble will give a free concert at 8 p.m. Friday, Dec. 12. The Coleman Hall performance has been a traditional one to celebrate the last day of classes each semester. This fall's pro gram will include a version of "" Arrival"" arranged by the group's co-director Scott Ar- macost '81 and the title cut from BJRE's most recent album, Tunisia. The album, which had a delay, because of technical problems, is now available for $5 from band members, through the mail and at a table in the University Center Mall, though it will not be for sale in the bookstore."

Chorale concert gives note to,
new professor Christy Dana,"By AMY FORTGANG The University Chorale under the direction of Professor of Music Allen Flock gave its final concert of the semester Nov. 23, turning in a performance up to the quality audiences have come to expect from the campus's largest choral group. Although the singers repeated four of its Parents' Weekend con cert numbers, the program was well supplied with new pieces. The first section of the concert was performed by a double choir--tenors and basses on the Rooke Chapel stage were answered by sopranos and altos in the rear balcony. The effect of this split was a fine stereophonic sound that attested to the Chorale members' expertise. The most common problem with this arrange ment is an entrance lag on the part of one or the other of the choirs. This potential flaw was avoided through careful rehearsal. Appearing with the Chorale were the University Brass Quartet-- which played two pieces as well as a brass prelude to the concert-- and Visiting Instructor in Music Christy Dana--who treated the au dience to a short lecture demonstration on the jazz trumpet. The major disappointment with the concert came in the last part, in which the Chorale performed three contemporary numbers. Two of them had been heard before and the third--"" Jimmie's Got a j Goil""  by Vincent Persichetti--was an inane number that could | easily have been eliminated from the program, i One of the most interesting pieces was Brahms' "" Warum ist das Licht gegeben,""  a composition for chorus and chamber choir. The smaller vocal group--made up of 12 Chorale members--was well- balanced and sang with the muted yet dynamic quality for which Brahms aimed."

Another dramatic Jan Plan is staged,"By AMY KENNEDY In January, a group of students and faculty members will work on a production of the Stephen Sondheim musical A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum. This will be the third such pro duction at the University, according to Jack Fairweather, assistant technical director for the University Theatre. "" January is the only time during the year a musical can be done,""  Fairweather said. "" The regular slots just don't allow enough production days.""  A musical requires many more rehearsals than a straight drama does, and the sets tend to be more complex, he explained. If the productions continue to get directors and the interest from students remains strong, musicals will become a regular part of the Jan-Plan pro grams. Preparations for the upcoming production have already begun. Under the direction of James Den ton of Williamsport the large cast and crew are working towards a February performance date. The story of Forum revolves around the attempts of Pseudolus (played alternatively by Barry Fishel '81 and Patrick Pedro '81) to win his freedom from slavery. His young master, Hero (Peter Shaw '84), promises to release Pseudolus if the servant can deliver Hero's true love, Philia (Karen Spizzirri '82), to him. Philia, unfortunately, has been sold to Miles Gloriosus (Cameron Weston '84). The situa tion leads to comedic confusion and chaos. Assisting Denton in the technical aspects are Set/Costume Designer F. Elaine Williams, visiting assistant professor of English, Lighting Designer David Polsky '81, Musical Director Christopher McGahan, visiting assistant professor of music, Vocal Director Karen Spizzirri '82, Choreographer Kathleen Miller '82, Stage Manager Bruce Delaplane '82 and Assistant Stage Manager Donna Mealey '82."

The art work is part of a larger collection owned by Russian Art Images, Ltd., of Pittsburgh, the only gallery in the United States handling Soviet art. The prints on display are specifically of folklore art. The finely detailed and brightly col ored literary scenes should be pleasing to a broad audience. The stress of the show is on the Lithuanian art, which has a history rich in folk tradition stemming from the Middle Ages. This tradition is particularly well represented in the works of native artist Makunaite. Her prints depict colorful scenes bounded by heavy black outline -- very likely a reflection of the famous stained glass of Kaunas in Lithuania. There are also some fine wood- cuts by Russian artists, who are considered by experts to be the leading wood engravers in the world today.

illustrate rich folklore tradition,"By KRIS FORSYTHE and ROBBIE LICHTENSTEIN For those who appreciate Al Stewart's talents, his new album, 24 Carrots, released after a two-year absence from the public ear is another indication of this young man's success and will surely be another popular album. "" Midnight Rocks"" , the first single released, has already made its mark on the charts. It is represen tative of the style to which Stewart fans have become accustomed in Year of the Cat and Time Passages while still providing enough innovation to prevent his music from becoming tedious. Side one introduces these new touches, which in clude more emphasis on bass guitar and drums. Piano and guitar still tend to dominate--the style for which Stewart is recognized--but instead of be ing featured as solo instruments, the orchestration synthesizes them to provide more accompaniment to the vocals. Stewart's band, too, has also undergone many important--mostly personnel--changes helping to create the subtle "" rock and roll""  theme pervading his new works. Especially noticeable are Steve Chapman, Russell Kunkel, Jeff Porcaro, Mark Sanders and Beau Segal--the five new drummers-- bass player Robin Lamble, and saxophonist Bryan Savage. While making these significant changes Stewart has kept his tradition of catchy, yet meaningful, lyrics. In "" Murmansk Run/EUis Island,"" Stewart depicts the feelings of new immigrants arriving in America and accurately portrays their excitement and sorrow. . The album's underlying theme incorporated into each of the nine songs is that of leaving. The atypical side one begins with "" Running Man,"" followed by "" Midnight Rocks"" . "" Constantinople,"" the third song, is similar thematically to "" On The Border"" -- from Year of the Cat--in its early war depiction. Side two begins with "" Murmansk Run/Ellis Island"" , which is typical of Stewart's style. "" Op tical Illusion,""  the last cut of the disc, is a likely can didate for Stewart's next single release because of its short length, excellent orchestration and simple lyrics. Although slightly different from his two previous top-selling albums, Year of the Cat and Time Passages, 24 Carrots is sure to join them as another Al Stewart success. __________ ____________________ Photo-- Carl Jensen Three students at the opening reception W ednesday for the Center Gallery exhibit of Soviet folk art.

Kornetchuk spoke on the contemporary "" official"" art of Russia versus the "" under ground"" art that has come into existence in the 20th century.

Men's cross country,
16th in NCAA race,
SPORTS,'
Page 23,"By BOB DAVIS The men's cross country team com pleted their most successful season ever by placing 16th place in a field of 29 teams at the NCAA Championships Nov. 24 in Wichita, Kansas. This fall, the Bisons won the ECC Championship for a record sixth straight year Nov. 8, upset Eastern power Villanova to win the prestigious IC4A crown Oct. 20 and extended their dual meet unbeaten streak to 73 straight over six seasons. The harriers qualified for the NCAA Championships with a third place finish in the Eastern Championships Nov. 15 at Lehigh. The team topped their 17th place finishes of both of the last two years but still fell short of coach Art Gulden's expectations. "" We should've finished around 10th,"" said Gulden. "" I thought we were ready -- I didn't think we'd have problems. We didn't have a good meet."" Team members were also disappointed, although the squad's finish was their highest ever in the NCAA's. Mark Hulme '83, who placed 91st, commented, "" We all felt that we were good enough for the top 10."" Bill Reifsnyder '84, who finished 137th, observed, "" We ran flat -- not up to par. It was disappointing."" Texas El Paso easily won the team title with 58 points, followed by Arkansas with 152 and Penn State with 153. Bucknell totalled 398 points and as the fourth Eastern finisher in the race. In addition to Penn State, Villanova (ninth) and Pro vidence (15th) also placed higher than the Bisons. Suliman Nyambui of Texas El Paso won the individual title for the second con secutive year with a time of 29 minutes, 4 seconds over the 10 , 000 -meter Echo Hills Golf Club course. Penn State's Alan Schar- su was the first American finisher, placing seventh in 29 :52 in a race that has become increasingly dominated by foreign athletes in recent years. Steve Bigotto '82 was the first Bucknell runner to cross the line, managing 81st in 30 45 The remaining Bison runners were Hulme (91st in 30:49), tri-captain Rick Sayre '82 (95th in 30:51), Reifsnyder (137th in 31:21), tri-captains Mike Debraggio '81 (162nd in 31:26) and Jim O'Shea (210th in 32:12) and Jeff Hines '84 (213th in 32:17). According to Gulden, nagging injuries that annoyed the team all season "" were of a magnitude that they affected our per formance.""  O'Shea raced with a possible stress fracture of his shin and Reifsnyder had knee problems, according to Gulden. Reifsnyder said, "" I had a slight strain and wasn't mentally prepared as a result, and added, "" I went out too slow."" Several other Bison harriers also started too slowly, leading Gulden to comment, "" We should've been more aggressive, but that was my fault.""  Hulme said, "" We might have been a little timid -- we should have gone all out at the start. He said this was because "" if you didn't get out quickly, you couldn't make it up. People didn't die on the course."" Gulden described the Echo Hills course as relatively flat, a factor that "" didn't help""  the team's performance. He said, "" We like to run hills -- this course wasn't demanding."" Reflecting on the season, Gulden said, "" We've had our most exasperating year with respect to injuries and sickness. Until the conference meet, we'd never run our best team. The resiliency showed was ex traordinary -- there was always somebody to fill in.""  The coach also noted, "" We have kids who didn't make our top seven who could've run in the NCAA's for another team. Photo-- Dove Folsom"

Mays was not the only suc cessful Bison wrestler as seven of 10 starters finished in the top four places in their respective weight CldSS6S Jim TenBrook '84, John Stoner '82 and Mark Baker '82 finished second at 150,167 and 177 pounds, respectively. Bill White '84 finish ed third in the 158 pound class as did Steve Greenly '82 at 190 pounds. Wally Zimmerman '83 was fourth at 142 pounds and Tim Pangonas '84 wrestled for fifth place in the heavyweight divi sion. With their success in such a competitive tournament, it ap pears that the Bisons have a lot of potential. Ferraro noted, "" We registered more pins than any other team in the tournament,"" while the freshmen making their college debut "" performed like ex perienced wrestlers.""  He added, "" We're a young team and we'll be getting better as the season goes on."" Last season the Bisons had their first winning record since 1974-75 with a 10-7-1 mark. The squad also finished fourth in the ECC tournament. The wrestlers travel to Penn State Saturday for a tournament in which nine of the top 20 teams in the nation will be competing. Accordingly, the Bisons "" will be looking more for individual per formance,"" said Ferraro."

Jeff Crossland '83 defeated Joe Weber '80 15-6 in the decisive third game to capture first place in the men's divi sion. Weber edged defending champion Don Shacknai '83 in the semifinals of the men's draw that featured over 50 competitors. Patty Inchalik '81 bested j Dee Raponi of Lewisburg 15-12 in the third game to win the women's title. Tracy Milton '80 who graduated and did not compete this year, was the defending champion. Brian Moran '83 and Kellyn Robertson '84 edged Shacknai and Stacy Bernhard '83 21-11, 21-18 to win the mixed doubles title in a field of 15 teams.

"Lock Haven women upend Bisons, 63-52","ByJEANNE MINAHAN Disappointing is the only accurate description of the opening con test for the women's basketball team as the Bisons traveled to Lock Haven Tuesday night and lost to the Eagles, 63-52. In last season's en counter, the Bisons were 73-63 victors when they finished with an 8-10 record. The problem according to Head Coach Terrie Grieb was "" defense; we played man-to-man the whole game and they ran on us. We couldn't get back on 'D' ."" Lock Haven was in foul trouble early in the game but Bucknell couldn't capitalize as the squad was six for 22 from the free-throw line. From the floor, the Bisons' 37 percent could not match the Eagles' 49 percent but Bucknell pulled down 37 rebounds to 19 for Lock Haven. Jill Henry '81 snared 13 rebounds and Denise Cohen '83, "" shot well, but fouled out with seven minutes to go which hurt us,""  according to Grieb. Lock Haven dominated the Junior Varsity contest, winning 71-45.. Jeanne Groeneveld '83 tallied 12 points while Sue Gray '84 sank six buckets and pulled down 11 rebounds. Workouts for the 19-girl team began October 15 and Co-Captain Henry noted, "" we have a strong freshmen class, and only one senior graduated."" Pete CautUli is the new junior varsity coach and assistant varsity coach who "" has a very good rapport with the girls on the team,"" ac cording to Henry. Grieb replaces Rebecca Carr, varsity coach for four years. The Bisons travel to New Rochelle, N.J., tonight for their first ap pearance in the Iona Tournament. New Haven and Rochester will join the host Gaels and Bucknell in the tournament. Henry hopes the team "" will regain confidence and play consistently."""

Men's track favored in ECC,"__________ __ _ ______ _ in ia<<t vpar's ECC race, strength in the 60 yan By ARTHUR BROCKWAY Returning the bulk of the team that won their second straight ECC indoor championship, who can possibly be expected to com pete with the men's track team? Distance runner Mark Hulme '83 answers that "" Most of the com petition is going to be within our own team rather than within our conference."" Having already won the ECC cross country championship this fall, the Bisons begin their quest for the second leg of the ECC tri ple crown, the indoor season, when they host an open meet at noon S a t u rd a y in the Sports/Recreation Complex. Coach Art Gulden offers op ponents the chilling thoughts, "" We'll be deeper just about everywhere than we've been in the past. We can score in every event."" The Bisons feature their most talent in the distance events where competitors from the cross country team , 16th place finishers in the NCAA Champion ships, will be concentrated. For instance, in last year's ECC race, Rick Sayre '82 , Jim O'Shea 81 and Bob Murdock '83 placed one- two-three at three miles and are all looking for more of the same success. Bucknell runners also took three of the top six positions in the one mile race and four of the top six at two miles in the ECC Championships. Gulden's forces in the field events will be stronger than ever. Middle distance runner Tom Madigan notes, "" The field events are going to be a lot stronger than they have been in the last few years. They're going to surprise a lot of people."" Sophomore Ted Lewis returns with the school high jump record of six-foot-eight (and seven feet in practice) in his possession. Pole vaulter Dave Keller was fourth in the conference meet while Kris Coghlan '81 and Jim Passannante '82 were sixth in the triple jump and shot put, respec tively. __ , Sprinter Martin Carter 83, who tied the school record for the 100 yard dash outdoors, will provide strength in the 60 yard dash in doors. Among the top middle distance runners and hurdlers are Madigan and Gary Thompson '82. Madigan was fifth at 880 yards in the ECC after placing third as a freshman. Madigan predicted, "" I could be right there as a con tender as long as there aren't a lot of injuries (to myself) and no other other problems.""  Thomp son was fifth in last year's 60 yard high hurdles conference race. Hulme sums up the sentiments of most team members, saying, "" I think this year we'll ^really clean up in the conference."""

We know we have to work really hard every night."" Leslie said, "" It was a new ex perience for all of us"" and "" We picked up a little more con fidence."" Lafayette, 44-40 losers to Virginia Commonwealth in their opening match up provided the competition in the contest for third place. The Leopards shared the East Coast Conference West Division title with Bucknell last year and were selected over the Bisons to compete in the NIT by virtue of a season-ending 92-79 win over Bucknell. Lafayette's patient offense and tenacious one-three-one defense gave them an early lead which they expanded to 34-21 at halftime. The tenacity the Bisons showed against Virginia had greatly diminished. Woollum said, "" How can you not be up for Lafayette?"" According to the Bison coach, the turning point of the half came when the Leopards gained a 17-16 advantage. "" Emotionally, we had a letdown at this point. We shot the ball atrociously.""  In deed, Bucknell hit only 17 percent (four of 24) of their first half at tempts while Lafayette shot at a 48 percent clip. In the second half, cold shooting continued to plague the Bisons. Leslie, the team's leading scorer in 13 of 27 games last year, made only one field goal (a career single game low) in 14 tries while the team was shooting only 28 percent. Lafayette, meanwhile, con tinued their high shooting ac curacy (44 percent for the game) by working for inside shots. In all, the Leopards outrebounded Bucknell 41-35 and benefitted from 20 Bison turnovers to emerge with a convincing 69-47 triumph. Forward Mike Page '81 played a strong game with a dozen re bounds and tied Leslie for high scorer on the squad with eight points. Leslie said simply, "" We just played rotten.""  Woollum remark ed, "" We had no offensive flow"" and added, "" I don't think we played anywhere near our abili ty."" Virginia won the championship trophy with a 77-62 victory over Virginia Commonwealth. The Breakin' Bisons go for their first win in their regular season home opener against Carnegie-Mellon at 8 p.m., Satur day, in Davis Gym. Last year Bucknell escaped with a hard- fought 78-69 decision in Pitt sburgh. Okorodudu commented, "" It's an important game for us. We want to start beating the teams we need to be beating (to qualify for the ECC playoffs)."" He add ed, "" When you have a bad game like that (the loss to Lafayette) you just have to keep working on the things you've been working on all year."" Woollum agreed, stating "" The only answer is time and work.""

McDonald named to,
All-American team,"Four players from the 6-4 Bucknell football team, the winningest squad since 1972's 5-4 team, received post season honors this week. Mike McDonald '80 was selected to the University Division I-AA Kodak All-American team at offensive tackle by the American Foot ball Writers Association. McDonald, a dean's list student who cap tained the Bisons in 1979, was the dominant force in the offensive line all year and has been heavily scouted by NFL teams. Halfback Ken Jenkins '82 failed to make the team despite leading NCAA Division I-AA in scoring with 96 points and all-purpose running with 188.4 yards per game. Jenkins also set an NCAA division record with 1,884 all-purpose running yards and shattered school season records with 213 rushing attempts, 1,270 rushing yards and 16 touchdowns. The three running backs selected were seniors Frank Hawkins of Nevada-Reno (the nation's leading rusher), Lorenzo Bouier of Maine (the second leading rusher) and Joe Delaney of Northwest Louisiana (fifth in rushing yardage). Jenkins was the fourth leading rusher in the nation and was far ahead of Delaney in both scoring and all purpose yards. Jenkins, however, was named to the ECAC Division I-AA team along with defensive back McKinley Norris '81. Tri-captain Joe Catalano '81 was an honorable mention pick at linebacker while McDonald, amazingly, was left completely off the team. The 10 ECAC I-AA head coaches chose a single 30-man squad, including ties. Norris tied for the team lead with four interceptions and made 43 tackles this season. Catalano led the squad in tackles with 137 and totalled 360 for his career as he earned three varsity letters."

For The Gift Of A Lifetime,
Handcrafted Gifts,"Gold & Silver Jewelry Freshman Judy Olson garnered a 79th place finish in the AIAW National Cross Country Cham pionship Nov. 15 in Seattle. Olson, the first Bucknell freshman ever to qualify for the AIA^  Cham pionship race, covered the 5,000 meter Tyee Valley Golf Club course in 19 minutes, 33 seconds, her fastest 5,000 meter time ever. In a field of 170 competitors in the race hosted by Washington U niversity, Idaho's Patsy Sharpies was the first place finisher, completing the course in 17:44. South Dakota State cap tured the team championship with 82 points followed by Seattle Pacific with 99. Bucknell did not qualify for the National championship because of a sixth place team finish in the EAIAW Division II qualifying race Nov. 1 at Indiana, Pa. Only the top three teams from the Eastern championship qualified for the National finals. Olson was the lone Bison runner to qualify for the AIAW cham pionship race as a result of her 14th place time of 19:35 in the Eastern championship. In the cross country team's five meets prior to the Eastern champion ship, Olson never finished higher than second among Bison run ners.. Jo Burrell '83 was the first Bucknell finisher in every meet except for the Eastern champion ship where she ended up 34th in 20:18, missing a spot among the top 15 qualifying for the National championship. Olson, who attended the race only with coach Diane Ware, had ""no idea what to expect"" before the race but said, ""I just wanted to come in before the 150th per- son ""  She c o m m e n t e d , ""Strategically, I didn't run a real good race. I didn't go out fast enough."" Olson ""felt relieved"" after finishing so high against the top female collegiate runners in the country, concluding, ""It was a completely new experience."

Bisons are fourth,
in Virginia tourney,"By DAVE KIRKPATRICK and JEFF CROSS CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. - The Breakin' Bisons opened their regular season with a pair of losses at the Virginia Tipoff Classic here last weekend, losing to host Virginia, the eventual tournament champions, 64-45 Fri day night and 69-47 to Lafayette in Saturday night's consolation game. Coming off a 24-10 season last year and a first place finish in the National Invitational Tourna ment, Virginia was ranked as high as fifth nationally in preseason polls. The Cavaliers' starting five includes seven-foot- four sophomore center Ralph Sampson, called by Bucknell Head Coach Charlie Woollum ""the greatest to play the game at this stage of his career,"" and six- foot-six senior guard Jeff Lamp who was the leading scorer in the rugged Atlantic Coast Con ference two years ago. Of the imposing Virginia squad, Bison center Deb Okorodudu '82 said, ""None of our players were intimidated. The pressure was on them."" Team captain A1 Leslie '81 noted, ""We weren't intimidated. We were more afraid to play badly."" Despite playing opposite the most highly regarded collegiate center since perennial National Basketball Association all-star K a r e e m  A b d u l - J a b b a r , Okorodudu said, ""I was really caught up in the emotion of the game and I wasn't nervous. I knew I had to play physical (against Sampson)."" To combat the size disad vantage throughout the Bucknell lineup, Woollum decided to employ a tightly packed two- three zone defense. Okorodudu, in giving up nine inches to Samp son, said, ""We knew we had to go out there and hustle, play good defense and not let Sampson get too many shots."" Leslie got the Bisons off to a surprising 6-0 lead by canning two outside jumpers and then scoring on a lay-up after making the first of his six steals for the contest. However, the Cavaliers reeled off eight unanswered points to take a lead they would never relinquish. The inexperienced Bisons did not collapse, though, and scrap ped furiously on defense to keep the halftime deficit to 29-18. Bucknell actually outrebounded Virginia 15-10 for the half. Ray Moss '83 had five of the Bison re bounds and provided the most spectacular offensive move of the half when he performed a reverse slam dunk over Sampson with five minutes left. The Cavaliers could not shake Bucknell and the Bisons crept to within 10 points midway through the final 20 minutes. At this point, though, Sampson snared a re bound, fired an outlet pass to playmaking guard Jeff Jones, hustled to the Virginia end and converted Jones' return pass into a slam dunk. Virginia then pulled away, building their lead to 24 points at one juncture and time expired with the Cavaliers com fortably ahead, 64-45. Leslie was the game's leading scorer with 20 points while Samp son and Lamp both had 16 for Virginia. Sampson also had eight rebounds and three blocked shots, both game highs. Woollum said, ""Virginia is a far superior team to us"" but, ""we made a good effort, especially on defense."" The Bisons hit on only 35 per cent of their shots and ""The of fensive flow was poor"" remarked Woollum, "" But it (better cohesiveness) takes a lot of ex perience (playing together)."" He added, ""We still have a lot of work to do to function as an offen- See VIRGINIA, page 26 Photo-- Jon Golden"

"Seniors Marc Corl, Pete Weiman and goaltender Tony Paxton (dark caps, I. to r.) defend",
against Slippery Rock earlier this season. The Bisons lose six seniors to graduation.,"By JEFF CROSS Like Sisyphus trying to push a boulder up a hill in Hades, the water polo team has spent each of the last four years trying to break the stronghold of California teams on the national championship trophy. To become NCAA champions, the Bisons not only had to win the Eastern Championship, which they did for the fourth straight year, but also upset a California team in the first round of the national cham pionships. Although they gave every ounce of their strength, the Bisons were once again dealt a first round defeat and they went on to finish seventh of eight teams in the NCAA Championships last weekend in Long Beach, Ca. The seventh-seeded Bisons took their 30-2-2 regular season record in to their opening game at noon, Saturday against second-seeded California-Irvine realizing that Irvine ""was out of our league"" ac cording to Captain Scott Schulte '81. Despite playing such a vaunted squad, the Bisons scored at an even pace with Irvine in the second quarter to trail by only 5-3 at halftime. Irvine's bench strength began to take a toll in the second half, however, and Bucknell was outcored 8-1 in the half to bring the final tally to 13-4. Goaltender Tony Paxton '81, who made a dozen saves, said, ""Depth hurt us in the second half. They started to get counters and we had trouble keeping up our intensity."" The Bisons were outshot 32-19 by the eventual third place finishers (Stanford won the national crown with an 8-6 triumph over California- Berkeley). Schulte scored three times in five shots and Marc Corl '81 added the other Bucknell goal. With their chances at a national championship gone, the team came back Saturday night to face the defending national champions, California-Santa Barbara. Paxton said, ""We figured it would be our best chance to beat a team from California, our number one goal."" With inspired play, the Bisons jumped to a fast 2-0 lead and led 4-2 at See WATER POLO, page 27"

Suarez takes the oath;,
drastic change proposed,"By DAVID GROSSMAN Michael Suarez '82 was sworn in as president of the Association of Bucknell Students Monday night, pledging in his inaugural address to "" radically improve the effectiveness of the ABS Congress."" Suarez concentrated on his urge to redirect the ABS' function from "" a largely discussive body primarily concerned with policy and proposals""  to "" a more active Congress, where the primary em phasis is placed upon programs for students."" While downplaying the importance of committee work, Suarez in troduced the concept of a team structure to the Congress. Suarez said "" each team is responsible for gathering information and ideas, establishing contacts and making recommendations to the Con gress."" The team, composed of two people, is to act as both a "" task force"" that investigates issues and makes these recommendations, and as a liaison between the Congress, the existing committees, and the administration, Suarez said. Another important change that will be implemented in the Con gress is the structure, frequency and location of meetings. Suarez said "" most often our meetings will not be deliberations, but will rather be working, problem-solving sessions.""  Suarez attributed this change to the increased amount of investigative work that must be See ABS, page 9."
Study on expansion of,
UC's third floor begun,"By CINDY CROSSLEV A study to determine the cost of completing the third floor of the University Center and to create additional dining space adjacent to the Buttery rooms has been commissioned by the University using the UC's original architect and engineer. Vice President for Administra tion and Finance John Zeller said the study -- part of an overall review of space current ly being conducted by the University -- is preliminary and that the University has no plans at this time to proceed with any recommendations made by Ar chitect Nils Larson, of Larson and Larson, and Engineer Louis Bouvier, of Louis Bouvier and Associates, both of Winston- Salem, N.C. "" We have no money for this,"" Zeller said, referring to the University's plans for following through with the proposals. Depending on the results of the study, a recommendation could Two engineering students are conducting a study of the traffic flow in the U.C. and of inefficiency in the cafeteria -- page 5. ______________________"
_,"be made to tne University Board of Trustees as early as May, Zeller said. He said he expects those results in about six weeks. Zeller said the study is based on a plan that calls for the top floor of the center to be finished with a museum, a lounge and two other rooms, one of which is designated for student activities. The plan also incorporates adding another room above the main dining service kitchen and adjacent to the Buttery dining rooms. According to Zeller, this would mean the windows in the But tery rooms would be lost. Access to the new room would be gain ed through the present lobby of the Refectory and Buttery room 241-D. The^exterior design of the din ing addition is envisioned as a glass-enclosed room with metal roofing. According to Dining Service Director Henry Ross, this would allow for a passive solar heating system, making use of what he called a "" decent amount of sunlight""  received by that side of the building. Inside, the room would seat between 200 and 300 people in 4,000 square feet of space. Both Ross and Zeller des cribed the room as a sort of "" multi-purpose""  room. At lunch time, the room could be used to relieve the pressure on the Bostwick cafeteria, serving a limited menu of soup and salad. Ross said the meals would be served from portable equipment that could be rolled away and stored at night. Then the room would be used for receptions or other social functions, such as Christy's Gate. When Larson and Bouvier were on campus in January, See NEW CHANGES, page 5"

Thornburgh speaks on education aide,
GOV. DICK THORNBURGH,"By DAVID HAWKINGS HARRISBURG -- Pennsylvania Gov. Dick Thornburgh renewed his promise Jan. 23 to make improvement of higher education in the state one of his ad ministration's top priorities, but he refrained from making any strong fiscal commitment to private colleges and universities. Thornburgh said he believed the state should have "" minimal interference"" in the operation of private institutions like Bucknell, but he said state public, semi public and private schools would continue to receive government aid, especially at places where "" programs of particular in terest to the state""  are involved. Speaking to a group of 35 college newspaper editors at an afternoon news conference in the Governor's Mansion here, the governor said virtually all aid to private colleges would come in the form of additional spending in the Institutional Aid Grants program and the Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency, two programs that offer financial aid to keep students in Pennsylvania based colleges. The governor pledged to increase the level of funding as he has in each year of his administration for the PHEEA, but he said funds were not currently available to raise the income ceiling on the Institu tional Aid Grants -- now set at $25,000 -- because "" when you raise the ceiling you cut down the size of each piece of pie."" The sole way to increase the amount of aid to private colleges, Thornburgh said, would be to give these fwo assistance organizations the extra money the state would save through the creation of a Com monwealth University system--a system he has pushed for since his gubernatorial campaign of 1978. The Commonwealth system would enable the state educational systeiA to benefit from what the governor called "" the economies of scale"" in purchasing educa tional and other supplies for state schools and would provide a tighter control of their curricula. A bill to establish the system is now before the legislature and has "" a pretty good chance of passage,""  Thornburgh said. On a topic unrelated to education and aid to schools -- the issues which monopolized questioning during the 90-minute session -- Thornburgh reiterated his support for lowering the drinking age in the state, but he said it would be "" very unlikely the legislature would respond differently than they did two years ago""  to a bill that would reduce the age to 18."

Faculty approves Fall Break for 1981,_________ __ i xi
_,"x x jii..^ i> x ot tho onH ftf tho term omnlH rprpss. the faculty intends to discuss its "" effects"
s,"By LYDIA HIGGINSON The University faculty approved a motion Dec. 15 to include the Fall Break in next year's calendar after a debate which lasted through two of the days in the body's four day meeting. The approved Fall Break will begin at 5:45 p.m., Fri day, Oct. 30 and will end at 8 a.m., Wednesday, Nov. 4. The faculty meeting opened with the consideration of an amendment proposed by Professor of Chemistry Hans Veening, which called for adding two days elsewhere in the term to make up for the time lost due to the break. University Committee on Instruction Chairman Joseph LaBarge said opening the semester two days early would cause other serious difficulties, and that adding ""the days at the end of the term would virtually abolish the reading period. After discussing the possibility of making up the lost days on weekends, the faculty defeated Veening's amendment. Several faculty members expressed concern about the scheduling of the recess. Professor and Head of Modem Languages Allan Grundstrom asked why the break fell eight weeks into the semester instead of in the middle. The recess could not occur earlier since Homecoming Weekend is scheduled for Friday, Oct. 23 through Sun day, Oct. 25 and could not be changed, LaBarge said. LaBarge's motion to include the Fall Break in next semester's calendar was then passed. After this fall's recess, the faculty intends to discuss its "" effects""  and later determine whether to continue the break. Last fall's break was closely watched by faculty and administration, and informal observations by Dean of Student Affairs John Dunlop and Dean of the College of Engineering Barry Maxwell indicated that there was "" no significant difference""  in class attendance in the days before the break. When the faculty originally voted in November 1979 to schedule a mid-term recess, certain conditions were set for its continuation. These include "" normal""  class atten dance by students and faculty members on the days im mediately preceding and following the break."

night as a participant in the Mortar Board Society s Last,
"Lecture"" series. Candland said Bucknell and other univer",
sities develop thinking capacities but often leave the po,
tential for feeling undeveloped.,"ByBlLLTHUM The University Committee on Planning and Budget voted Wednesday to recommend a 15.2 percent, $1100 increase in tuition and fees for next year to the Ex ecutive Committee of the Univer sity Board of Trustees. If accepted by the executive committee -- which will meet in New York City Thursday -- B u ck n e ll' s co m p re h e n siv e charges would increase from $7321 to $8431, with wage and salary increases amounting to 9.5 percent across the board and an additional 5 percent for merit, structural and equity compensa tion, according to the 12th alter nate to the budget prepared by the committee. Vice President for Administra tion and Finance John Zeller reported to the committee the results of the informal surveys on which the proposal is based. In a study by University President Dennis O'Brien, the average in crease of salaries among faculty at Bucknell's 17 fram e of reference schools was 12.1 per cent in 1980-81 Bucknell's increase amounted to only 7.96 percent, far behind these other schools, Zeller said. It is due to this difference that the faculty has pressured the committee to include a 2 percent catch-up item in addition to the 12.2 percent increase projected by these other schools, Zeller said-. In a survey prepared by Col gate University of a slightly more prestigious group of institutions, Bucknell's ranking fell from sixth in 1979-80 to tenth in 1980-81 out of 12 in average faculty compensa tion. Bucknell is currently more than $1100 below the average for the group. In addition to the ine quities in faculty compensation, the administration, staff and physical plant are faced with an increase in the consumer price index of 13.3 percent for 1979 and 12.4 percent for 1980, Zeller said. Chairman of the University Committee on Planning and Budget Stephen Becker said the proposal fell short of the faculty's call for a 15 percent wage in crease and "" doesn't begin to cor rect the inequities of the current year."" Also, although faculty will receive a 14.5 percent increase, most non-academic staff will gain a 9.5 percent increase in ad dition to the 1.5 percent already determined in December. Light con stru ction w ork ers and foremen will receive an addi tional 1 percent in structural and equity increments for a total of 12 percent, Zeller said. ABS President Michael Suarez '82 said although he knows infla tion is high, the board of trustees"
Arrival of new computer expected,
as construction lags behind schedule,"By STEVE GARFINKEL Although the Computer Center is ready for the arrival of the new Honeywell computer, the con struction of the building is still behind schedule, according to Physical Plant Director John Bell. Bell said the basement floor of the building is three weeks behind schedule and the top two floors are two weeks behind. The delays were caused by the late arrival of the tinted glass which encircles the top of the building. Construction workers were not able to perform certain plastering jobs since heat could not be con tained within the building without the glass, Bell said. According to Vice President for Administration and Finance John Zeller, all cost estimates in dicate the center is within the budget. Bell con firmed this observation but added that all estimates of costs cannot be accurately tabulated until after the building is completed. Elmer Ritter of Ritter Bros., the general con tractors for the $1.3 million building said, "" The second floor is 99 percent complete."" Director of Computer Activities Jon Eschinger estimated the transition to the new computer system will take one year and cost between $300,000 and $350,000. The Honeywell DPS -- which will replace the present Xerox Sigma 7 -- was shipped from Phoenix, Arizona today and will arrive within ten days, Zeller said. The new computer will be on the second floor of the Center. Costs for the entire project exceed $3 million. The computer system alone claims $1 million of the budget, with conversion and transition costs expected to reach $300,000. The new building and its furnishings are expected to cost $1.3 million. The top two floors of the building will not be opened for use before next semester, because the new computer will not be operable until then, Zeller said. Included in the computer center project is the remodeling of the Dana Engineering building. Renovations are expected to cost close to $250,000. The most costly item is a $135,000 sprinkler system to be installed during the summer of 1982. Four engineering labs have also been ear marked to receive $200,000 worth of new equip ment. "" must be sensitive to the fact that students cannot tolerate a series of $1100 increases.""  In this light, Suarez said he will follow the recommendations of the ABS Committee on Finance and sug gest that the board increase the percentage of endowment income used to offset the budget from 5 to 6 percent. He will also "" urge the Trustees to investigate alternate sources of income to the University, par ticularly in light of President Reagan's plans to cut aid to universities,""  he said. Suarez also plans to call for an increase of $4 to $6 in the Student Activities fee. This would be used to provide "" better programs and m ore social a ltern atives,"" Suarez said. In an interview, one trustee ex ecutive committee member said "" The decision is a difficult one. In addition to the need of maintain ing academic excellence, there is the need to keep the cost of educa tion at a level where not only the upper-crust can afford it. "" Alsq,""  the trustee -- who ask ed for anonym ity -- said "" although the C.P.I. is presently e x t r e m e l y h i g h , by ad ministratively raising prices along with inflation, continued in flation at a similar level is the in evitable result."" *."

The proposal for the move was created by the President's Staff, a committee comprised of eight University administrators and headed by University President Dennis O'Brien. The committee considered numerous alter natives to provide more office space but concluded that moving University Relations was the most feasible solution. Other possibilities the Presi dent's Staff explored included moving an academic depart ment from Coleman Hall to the C.S.I.U. building or using it to house the Office of Admissions. Another option was to convert the building into a residence house and use another residence facility for the needed office space. th e intended location of University Relations offices will prevent easy access to the President's office and the business offices. Zeller said, however, that the inconvenience will probably be less than if of fices directly concerned with serving the student and faculty were moved from the academic quad. Director of Deferred Giving Fitz R. Walling said "" There are advantages and disadvantages to the move, but there is definitely a need for more space."" According to Walling, the C.S.I.U. building, a white Vic torian structure next to Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, will be vacated by the end of this month. Although the move has not been officially approved yet, Zeller said that if it is approved, the relocation should be com pleted by September of this year. Certain renovations are planned for the building in order to maximize the available space, Walling said. The most extensive changes will be made on the third floor, which needs to be altered in order to comply with fire regulations. An estimate of remodeling costs has not yet been deter mined, Zeller said."

Blum has sold 200 out of 500 printed copies since Feb. 2 and is "" about breaking even."" He at tributes the limited success of his venture to a lack of student awareness of how much he said they could save by using the coupon book. ""You could probably save about $100 if you used all 51 coupons, and even if you used only two or three, you could recover the cost of the book,"" Blum said. Blum sells the bargain books by sitting at a table in the UC mall. He originally intended to sell the circular through the University bookstore but was not permitted to according to Vice President for Administration and Finance John Zeller. "" The University doesn't want to have to guarantee that coupons are honored,""  Zeller said. "" Students may solicit in the UC and residence halls if they have permission,"" he added.

Phon-A-Thon called success despite,
less than record alumni support,"By ROBIN MEREDITH Although the total of $163,071 pledged to Bucknell's Annual Fund during this January's Phon-A-Thon fell short of last year's record, Director of An nual Giving William Torrey has pronounced this year's results the best in Phon-A-Thon history. While more than $166,000 was pledged in last year's drive, many difficulties worked against this year's steering committee in their effort to break the record Torrey said. Student Chairman Mary Gibbons '82 said that in addition to having one less night of calling, there were two other regional Phon-A-Thons earlier in the year and the 25th Reunion Class was not con tacted. "" This is a group known for its support,"" Gibbons said. Despite these difficulties, 30 volunteer students called more than 30,000 alumni each night for 20 nights to raise pledges nearly equal to last year's ef fort, Gibbons said. The students -- instructed by a steering committee of Patti Koch '83, Pam Ecock '82, Tom Cummings '81, Nick Spennato '81 and Sue Willis '82 -- were provided with information on the people they called and prizes were awarded to the most suc cessful callers as an incentive, Gibbons said. In a month-long contest, Anne Kalin '84 gained the most new donors and Laura Callahan '83 raised the most new money. The Phon-A-Thon represents a direct follow-up to a mailing on the Annual Fund that was sent to all Bucknell graduates in Oc tober. The Annual Fund differs from other donation categories in that its funds are not targeted for specific projects but are in stead used where they are most needed during the current academic year. Associate Director of Annual Giving Robert Kallin said "" Much of the success of this year's Phon-A-Thon must be at tributed to the cohesiveness of the steering committee in motivating the callers."" "" Many alumni look forward to those January calls; for the ma jority this is their only contact with Bucknell during the year,"" Torrey said."
Facuity limits night classes,"By SUSAN MACDONALD In a move to decrease the number of extra curricular conflicts with night courses and exams, the faculty -- in their December 17 meeting -- ac cepted the University Committee on Instruction's proposal that restricts night courses to Monday, Wednesday and Thursday nights. University Provost Wendell Smith said that in addition to allowing time for cultural events, "" The committee was moved to its action by a desire to take into account the position of students in a situa tion that is near anarchy.""  There is considerable "" underground"" scheduling, he asserted, and therefore some limitation is needed. Chairman of the Committee on Instruction Joseph La Barge said that the measure "" will also provide a better sense of predictability and regularity for both faculty and students. Although the plan restricts the holding of classes on Tuesday nights, exceptions could be granted by the Dean of the appropriate college, La Barge said. The resolu tion will go into effect in the Fall of 1981. In addition to this proposal, the faculty also decided to restrict exams held beyond the regularly scheduled classes. La Barge -- also head and associate professor of religion -- said the idea was that students must be forewarned that an exam would be held outside of the regularly scheduled classes. In this light, if there is a possibility of ex ams occurring outside of the regularly scheduled time, it must be listed in the class description in the course guide, La Barge said. This problem was especially acute in classes with multiple sections, like Biology, he said. Since theprofessor's preference is to give one common ex am, he added, if a student has a conflict, it would en tail dropping another obligation or taking a make up exam. / This puts the student in a very awkward posi tion, La Barge said. Michael Kaye '82, student member of the Com mittee, said the new policy could still cause many problems with class scheduling. "" Scheduling would be very difficult if classes had to be selected around specific exam times,"" Kaye said. La Barge said this problem could be avoided by not listing the times of the exams in the course descriptions, but instead,only if there wereito be outside exams. Once students were enrolled, the computer could be used to determine times that would not present conflicts, La Barge said."

Zeller said Digin will retain her position as patrolman after the new director of security is hired, thus expanding the size of the force by one person. Digin, 22, has had three years experience with the U.S. Army Military Police, and is a 1976 graduate of Lewisburg High School. The University has received three applications for the newly created position of director since it last offered the job to David Castilow of Omaha, Neb. Casti- low refused the University's offer Dec. 3. Although Zeller said he hopes to have a new director hired soon, he ""can't guarantee it."" In the meantime, there will be ""some modest changes, but nothing drastic"" in the security staff under Amarante, Zeller said. Zeller said he hoped to have a new director of security on the job by January in order to begin a revamping of the department, and to make it ""more profes sional."" Structural changes in the operation of security are ex pected to include a new ""pattern of operation"" with ""someone on duty 24 hours a day, seven days a week,"" Zeller said."
Women sweep GPAs,"ByBILLTHUM The mean grade point average for undergraduate students here last semester was 2.9, according to statistics released Jan. 21 by the Office of the Registrar. Women consistently scored higher G.P.A. s than did the men, but while sorority women scored higher than the non-sorority women, non fraternity and fraternity men achieved equal G.P.A.s. The registrar said students' grades improve as they get older. Mean grade point averages for men are recorded as 2.7 for freshmen and sophomores, 2.8 for juniors and 3.0 for seniors. This represents a decline in the mean G.P.A.s from 2.8 for sophomores and 3.0 for juniors in the previous semester. Women's G.P.A.s are 2.9 for freshmen, 3.0 for sophomores, 3.1 for juniors and 3.2 for seniors. This also represents a drop in the mean G.P.A.s from 3.2 for juniors and 3.3 for seniors while sophomores in creased from 2.9 inthe previous semester. A further breakdown of the statistics follows: Fraternities: Sigma Alpha Epsilon, 3.2; Tau Kappa Epsilon, 3.0; Delta Upsilon, 2.9; Kappa Delta Rho, 2.9; Lambda Chi Alpha, 2.9; Phi Lambda Theta, 2.9; Sigma Phi Epsilon, 2.9; Sigma Chi, 2.8; Kappa Sigma, 2.7; Phi Kappa Psi, 2.7; Theta Chi, 2.7; Phi Gamma Delta, 2.6; Sigma Alpha Mu, 2.6, and Phi Beta Sigma, 1.9.

Transcript of,
Suarez's first,
Address,"Below is a transcript of the text of the inaugural address which ABS President Michael Suarez '82 delivered to members of the ABS Congress at meetings both Monday and Wednesday nights. All tbe great bouses that ever sat have begun their endeavors with a moment of silent prayer. It is especially fitting that we do this tonight not only because of the im portance of the task which lies before us, but also because we should show our respect for the father of (ABS) Congressman Vergil Blake, who died only a few days ago. (Pause) On a more optimistic note, I have promis ed you something different; I have called you a new Congress; I have said that ypu and the office you hold are far more Important than you realize. The ravings of an idealistic leader? Perhaps. But perhaps not. See if the follow ing isn't familiar to you. Little gets accomplished at Monday night meetings; discussions often seem to have no point; the effectiveness of proposals is ques tionable. In short, we are frustrated. Mean while, the ABS has an image problem because even when we do something con structive, nobody knows about it. John Dzurinko has nothing to apologize for, and neither do you as a congress. However, we desperately need to change our method of attack and It must be exactly that. We will be a congress armed with informa tion and imagination. We will effect visible and tractable programs for tbe student body. We are not politicians; we are a group of con cerned students who are committed to im proving student life. Proposals have proven to be ineffective in providing tangible results for students. We are, therefore, the first ABS Congress to place its primary emphasis upon pro grams for students. When we must make proposals, they will be based upon sound in formation and research. In short, we will deal with trustees, administrators and facul ty on their own level as far as passible. Some of you look incredulous and I don't blame you--here's how we're going to do it. The ABS will never run a program alone -- we will work with outside organizations. For example, 1961 is the Y ear of Disabled Per sons. ABS Is working with Concern and Ac tion to sponsor a Disability Awareness week involving talks by Bucknell alumni and students with disabilities, a day where students can go to class in a wheelchair and the like. Another example is the Student Handbook. Quite obviously, it doesn't do the Job. I have already commissioned a group of students -- none of whom are congressmen -- to work on the publication of a new book in time for the fall semester. We have similar plans for a student course evaluation for next spring. We need to sponsor social alternatives; to explore and act on Issues such as the length of the supposed reading period, why students are afraid to go to the dispensary and the ideal of community at Bucknell. Experience has shown that committees often don't work In week-to-week operations. We will, therefore, use committees only when necessary. Rather, we will work In two-man teams. Each team is responsible for gathering information and ideas, establishing contacts and making recom mendations to the congress. Every representative will work on a team of his or her choosing. Every team will report to the congress. Most often our meetings will not be deliberations but wll rather be working problem-solving sessions I can promise that every meeting will be dif ferent and will challenge you. The task-oriented team approach wll radically improve the effectiveness of our congress. It will require two things of you First, a new expertise in creative program development and problem solving. Second, 1 will demand your time. The teams will work only If you fulfill your commitment to your office. Because you will be spending more time outside of the meetings, we will make them as short, enjoyable and yet businesslike a possible. W e'll say more about how we'll develop the expertise when we get to th "" new business""  part of this meeting. Finally, on behalf of tbe steering commit tee, I would like to ask the new congress, a my first official act as ABS president, rededicate themselves by taking the oath o office that we have just taken before you. What more needs to be said? Nothing ex cept thank you for listening so attentively, know we can make this thing work. It's whole new ballgame."
Suarez pushes for ABS revitalization,"The steering committee itself has also been planning some changes within the ABS' actual operating sphere.

Poland nominates,
new prime minister,"Polish Defense Minister General Wojciech Jaruzelski was nominated to replace dismissed Prime Minister Jozef Pinkowski at a meeting of the Central Committee of the Polish Communist Party Monday. Jaruzelski, a Soviet-trained of ficer, is generally regarded as a moderate. His appointment was seen as a way to increase the military's influence in a time of uncertainty since the new general strike broke out in the southwest and labor unrest con tinued elsewhere in the country. No reason was given for the dismissal of Pinkowski, who was appointed prime minister at the height of the strikes last August."

Chapman confers,

Chapman, who allegedly at tempted suicide twice before the shooting, was apparently ob sessed with Lennon. A trial date is expected to be set after preliminary motions in the State Supreme Court later this month."
Eight people killed,
in Vegas hotel fire,"Eight people were killed and 198 were injured in a fire that swept through a Hilton Hotel in Las Vegas Wednesday night. Fire Chief Roy Parrish of Clark Coun ty declared that the blaze was "" definitely arson."" The fire, which caused an estimated $10 million in damages, was apparently set in four places on the second, third, eighth and ninth floors. Henry Lewin, the executive vice president in charge of gam ing, was asked if there had been extortion demands. "" No extor tion,""  he replied, "" but telephone calls saying, 'Is the fire still on? Have they got you yet?' and also asking if I'm in-the hotel."" Asked if he had reason to believe the fire was directed at him, Lewin answered, "" I tell you, that's an assumption, it's a man who hates."""
"Grants, loans for",
students to be cut,"The primary target in the Reagan Administration's efforts to cut Federal spending in education would be loans and grants to college students, Secretary of Education T. H. Bell said. In an interview with the New York Times Jan. 28, Bell said the proposal will include cut backs on both the Basic Educa tional Opportunity Grants and the loan programs. He also reiterated the Administration's belief that education is primari ly a state and local affair."

Such an action would end the state's 48 year-old monopoly on the sale of wine and hard liquor. The legislation -- which will be brought before the State Senate -- would allow the crea tion of as many retail liquor stores "" as market condition, licensing requirements, local op tions and zoning regulations will permit,""  Thornburgh said."
Idleman appointed,
to board of trustees,"Lee Idleman '54 of Madison, N.J., has been named to the University's board of trustees. Idleman, 47, was also recently named to the board of directors of the Dean Witter Reynolds invest ment firm where he has been senior vice president and director of research since January 1980. While at Bucknell, he was president of Delta Mu Delta -- the business administration honor society -- and was treasurer of Kappa Delta Rho fraternity. He has served as a member of the trustees' Subcom m ittee on Investm ents for several years."

possession of drugs,"The case of Curtis Lee Naser, 21, of Lewisburg -- who has been charged with drug law violations and receiving stolen property Feb. 4 -- has been sent to Union County Court. After a preliminary hearing Monday afternoon, Lewisburg Area District Justice Leo Arm- bruster determined there was enough evidence to hold Naser, who is free on $5000 bail. Three charges of possession of marijuana and marijuana seeds with intent to deliver or manufacture, both felonies, were reduced to possession charges because the state did not present enough evidence to establish intent, Armbruster said. Naser, who was enrolled at the University in September 1977 and studied here for three semesters, will appear before the court in June."

_______,
An evolutionary process,
The University has hired an average of one security officer per,
month for the past three months. Two of the officers hired filled,
vacancies in the department. The third represents an expansion in,
the size of the force. All three patrolmen are highly experienced and,
faced rigid competition to land their positions.,
These hirings mark a positive turn in the evolution of the securi,
ty force. One of the patrolmen has served 20 years with the New,
"York City Police Department, another has an associate's degree in",
police administration and the most recently hired patrolman has,
worked for the FBI and as an MP in the U.S. Army.,
"The most recently hired patrolman is also a woman, the first on",
the force. Whether this occurrence is by accident or design is not,
relevant. What is important is that the University has actually taken,
a progressive action to improve the services of the staff. The action,
"is progressive because the students, half of whom are women, will",
finally be served by a female on the previously all-male security,
force.,
This is a step toward helping security aid and serve all the,
students effectively and completely. It could help promote better,
rapport between students and security; this is essential to the fulfill,
ment of security's responsibilities.,
Perhaps the next step is to get ourselves a director to lead the,
unit.,
Claws that catch,
Determining the budget is a thankless job. When faced with,
"soaring inflation, inequitable past compensation and human nature",
"-- along with a glutted market, a fragile economy and consumer",
unrest -- the task reaches nightmare proportions.,
While the reasoning and necessity of a $1100 tuition increase are,
"apparent, the implications of this event are disturbing. Particularly",
troubling is the realization that once even symbolically guaranteed,
"in contract, continued equally high inflation is inevitable.",
"The solution. . .  not a further padding of the budget, nor the can-",
"nabilistic consumption of our precious endowment income. Instead,",
the problem must be attacked at its roots.,
"If budget necessities require a 15.2 percent increase in tuition,",
limit the budget to only 14.2 percent. By ratcheting down inflation,
"administratively, the vicious circle can be arrested and the chaotic",
spiralling brought to a halt.,
"Of course, someone will suffer due to this harsh policy. Since",
more than 65 percent of the budget increase goes to personnel com,
"pensation, with the rest representing fixed cost increases, the facul",
"ty, administration and staff will not maintain the 14.5 percent in",
crease with such a policy.,
The trade-off is real and something we all have to face if we are,
to regain some stability in our economy.,
So we challenge the board of trustees to make the difficult deci,
"sion. Weigh the value of balancing the budget in reaction to inflation,",
or using the budget for a more stable future. The latter choice is,
"clearly the more difficult, but in the long run is possibly the only sen",
sible alternative.,
The W attsmobile,
We wrote five months ago to publicly thank University officials,
for acting quickly and gladly to brighten up our then-dingy working,
"quarters. Where there was squalor and drab, they made cheer",
fulness and color.,
"Now, these same people have made our second wish come true.",
"Despite the objections of certain other administrators, John Dunlop",
and John Zeller are providing us with a permanent set of wheels ef,
"fective this week, and already we are ever-grateful.",
But our gratitude is tinged with a sense of historic irony; it is an,
irony that should not be lost in the euphoria of our mobile moments.,
"You see, this is no ordinary car they have delivered unto us. A Cita",
tion or a station wagon? No. Ostentatious as it might seem at first,
"glance, the Bucknellian staff is now driving a 1976 Buick Limited -- a",
great tank of a car with automatic everything that was once the of,
ficial car of former University President Charles Watts.,
The irony here is that this car -- saved at the last minute from,
"the Cadillac Ranch -- belonged to Watts, a man whose witticisms",
"and cheery disposition, we are told, covered a somewhat seething",
resentment for college journalism. Especially here in Lewisburg.,
"And so, with a sense of pleasantly perverted history, we name",
our big black gas-guzzler. . . The Wattsmobile.,

Kwanza loses,"To the Editor: Last week was noted by the celebration of Kwanza, spon sored by the Black Student Alliance, which was one of the main cultural events on campus this semester. Yet there was one problem: the sharing of culture never occurred. For instance, at the opening ceremonies only four white people attended. It is very sad when you can count the spec tators present. Now, I realize that the advertising for the cere monies was not too profuse, but people notice when there is one poster up for a frat party. At the same time of this ceremony, "" Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer"" was on the TV. In Roberts Lounge alone over thirty-five people watched it. ho it can't be said that students were too busy studying to attend tne ceremonies. Aren't other people more important than some stupid TV program? Elizabeth Weil '84 Dec. 7,1980"

"Friday, February 13,1981",
By Phil Andrews,"Much reasoning is done to make the status quo seem reasonable -- even, of course, when it is not. After ex amining the status quo of the ABS, I have concluded that neither its structure nor its issue orientation accords with reason. Unless one has read the ABS Constitution, one might divine that the main function of the ABS Congress is to criticize John Zeller's annual proposals to raise tuition and fees. Unfortunately, the Congress deserves this image for its inaction on other issues over the years. On a slightly different tack, a person visiting the cam pus on a typical weekend might well surmise that frater nities set the tone of the social life here. He might also observe that this oligopoly benefits greatly from the absence of a publicly funded competitor (i.e., the ABS). After a month of interviewing a broad assortment of student, administration and faculty leaders about the state of the ABS, I have concluded that the two phenomena described above -- the Congress and the dearth of social alternatives -- are the ABS' major short comings. What are the causes of these weaknesses? With regard to the ABS Congress, I believe there are three major reasons for its near-constant docility. First, many congressmen are not committed to im proving the ABS -- unless time, effort and attendance are discounted as measures of commitment. Only freshmen dorm representative races are competitive, and since ""Congressman"" looks good on a resume, a considerable number of persons run for less than noble reasons. Second, most dorm council presidents exhibit little if any commitment to attend, and no observable tendency to participate in Congress meetings. And third, the ABS president dominates the Congress because he presides over it. Although the president is sup posed to be an impartial moderator, he inevitably becomes the legislative leader. Thus, he serves as chief executive, chief judge, and chief legislator. Efficient? Yes. Dangerous? I think so. In contrast to the near-everything role of the presi dent is the near-nothing role of the typical congressman. Rarely, if ever, does a congressman propose legisla tion. Rarely, if ever, does the Congress ask for reports from the students it has selected for committees. And rarely, If ever, does a congressman seek out student opi nion. By and large, they are a passive bunch. That, of course, is not the way it should or has to be. The following reforms would result in a more assertive, respected, and conscientious Congress: 1. Switch' from dorm-based representation to departmental-based representation. Freshmen dorm representatives, however, should be retained, because freshmen are more attached to their dorms than to their majors. Additionally, the eight at-large spots -- and the IFC, Panhell and class presidents--should be kept as members. They contribute. President O'Brien created a similar system at Mid- dlebury a few years back. According to Middlebury's dean of students, the system is ""remarkably stable"" and ""the most serious students are apt to be involved."" At Middlebury, a student advisory committee was formed in each department. The chairman was automatically the representative to the student congress."
PHILLING IN,"2. Dorm council presidents should be removed from membership in the Congress. As mentioned earlier, they are not often physically -- and virtually never mentally -- present at Congress meetings. 3. The ABS vice-president, rather than the president, should preside over the Congress. The president is suppos ed to be the chief executive, not the chief legislator or the chief judge. Removing this responsibility would free him to concentrate on executive duties, give the vice-president a meaningful role, and markedly reduce the psychological dominance that the ABS president has over the Congress. With regard to the dominant role of fraternities in the social life at Bucknell, there appear to be several reasons for this phenomenon. First, there is a strong fraternity tradition here (since 1848!). Although they were banned once for 13 years in the 1860s and 70s, only one of four collapsed during that time. Second, Pennsylvania's indefensibly high drinking age makes fraternities the only bountiful and legitimate distributors of alcohol to ""underage"" drinkers. And third, first semester rush fosters and perpetuates the notion that fraternities are central to the social life here. Ergo, if you don't join, you miss out. Regrettably, the message rings true. While the Coffee House and Christy's Gate are important contributions to non-fraternity social life, they are only partial alter natives to fraternity parties. Much more extensive alter natives are needed. Drawing from the interviews, I recommend the ABS do the following: 1. Form a coalition of educational, social and profes sional groups to lobby for lowering the drinking age. President O'Brien suggested lobbying for a change that would permit clubs to serve beer and wine to 18-21 year olds. It's worth a try. 2. Establish a weekend alternatives committee and provide it with ample funds to sponsor several dances and band parties et. al. each semester. 3. Continue to pressure the administration to complete the University Center's third floor. Provost Wendell Smith told me the ABS work was ""effective"" and ""may cause us to move more rapidly."" 4. Find a permanent home for Christy's Gate. Beth Sipple deserves at least this much for coming up with such a marvelous idea (""Sipple's Gate?"" ). 5. Consider hiring an assistant for two superb, but overworked student programs coordinators -- Jim Ham- merlee and Ruth Burnham. Hammerlee says he ""could make this place hum"" with one more assistant. 6. Raise the student activities fee to finance the pro grams above. Albert North Whitehead once wrote, ""The art of pro gress is to preserve order amid change, and to preserve change amid order."" The purpose of this column is not to praise the ABS, nor to bury it. It is to prod the ABS to transform itself from a pussycat into a tiger -- without losing its stripes. Phil Andrews '81 joins the Bucknellian this week as a regular columnist; his ""Philling In"" will be published biweekly, alter nating w eeks with ""The Buch Stop"" by Todd G. Buchholz. An drews -- a former ABS president and now the chairman of the Bucknell Student Lectureship and an active member of Common Cause -- will write on various campus, locatand national topics."

ussGjss Ltiu;Li,
That question was asked of many students by their parents after the,
fire at Providence College which claimed the lives of nine students,
several years ago. Similar questions are being asked today because of,
the MCM Hotel fire in Las Vegas or the nursing home fire in New Jersey.,
Why did those students die at Providence College?,
Several died because they panicked and jumped from fourth floor,
windows unnecessarily. Several were asphyxiated because they tried to,
find their way down a smoke filled hall.,
"Others stayed in their rooms, stuffed towels under the door, and",
were rescued in due course.,
DO YOU KNOW WHAT TQ DO IF THERE IS A FIRE IN YOUR DORM?,
The most important principle is don't panic.,
"Get out quickly if you can. Walk, don't run to the nearest firestairs.",
"Sound the alarm. The sooner the firemen are summoned, the better.",
Do you know how? Is the emergency instructor card posted by your,
phone? Have you memorized the emergency number,--
1111?,
Do what you can to be sure that everyone is awake and out of the,
building.,
"Once outside, count heads and double check.",
"If the fire is confined to a small area, and you can safely approach it,",
use the fire extinguishers.,
"If the fire is in a room or small area, confine it by closing the doors",
and cutting off oxygen until the firemen arrive.,
"If you are trapped in your room, stuff towels under and around the",
"cracks in the door. Go to the window and await rescue, or hang a towel",
or sheet from the window to attract attention. Do not panic.,
WHAT CAUSES DORMITORY FIRES?,
"Fires are caused by many things, most of them thoughtless: a",
"carelessly placed candle, faulty wiring on an old appliance or a worn ex",
"tension cord, cooking in rooms (fiot fat is very dangerous-- the kitchens",
"hdve special automatic extinguisher systems), smoking in bed, or a",
match in a wastebasket.,
"The University makes every, effort td make your dorm firesafe.",
Sprinkler systems or fire detection devices have been installed in every,
"room and corridor. Except at Bucknell West, these are connected to a",
central alarm system which will automatically warn the operator on duty,
at the powerhouse who will dispatch a security officer to the scene,
immediately. But they do not automatically call the fire company. You,
must do that yourself by dialing the emergency number,--
1111.,
"There are approved fire escapes on all multi-story buildings, and",
enclosed fireproof stairtowers have been installed in every large dorm to,
meet the standards of the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and In,
"dustry. Fire-rated doors, walls, and ceilings are standard everywhere.",
They will prevent the rapid spread of flames and assure time to escape.,
"But they can't stop smoke and lethal gases, and fire doors won't work if",
they are propped open.,
"It is the contents which bum, and the contents which create toxic",
smoke and lead to asphyxiation.,
What have you introduced into your room that could lead to death?,
Flammable nets or drapes? Combustible plywood for lofts? Cardboard or,
paper products? Candles burning too near a drape or curtain? Too many,
electrical appliances that overload the electrical system? A tangle of,
extension cords? Combustible plastics that produce lethal fumes when,
burned?,
Fire extinguishers have been installed at convenient locations to be,
used in an emergency. Who is responsible for a death that results,
because the fire extinguisher was empty when it was needed? Who,
emptied the fire extinguisher? The physical plant and residential life of,
fices report that an average of ten or more fire extinguishers are emp,
tied frivolously each month on this campus. Although checks are made,
"regularly, they cannot be made daily or hourly. When you empty a fire",
"extinguisher, you endanger the lives of your roommates.",
"Fire drills are a necessary precaution. When the alarm sounds, do",
you drop everything and get out immediately? Or do you turn over and,
go back to sleep assuming it's a prank? Whose fault is it if you don't get,
out safelyin a real fire? It's your life! Have you carelessly put it at risk?,
Have you made it plain to your peers that you won't tolerate pranks that,
do so?,
"Safety is everyone's business, and everyone's responsibility.",
Is your dorm safe?,--
Only if you keep it so.,

By Frank Patrick,"Men! We -- you and I -- have been guilty of a grievous fault. We have been speaking sexist language all our lives, to the gross injury of the fem ale sex. Ladies! Forgive us, for we knew not what we did. When we used such phrases as "" A ll men are created equal,""  we did not realize that we w ere leaving you out. We honestly thought that "" men""  covered all human beings, m ale and fem ale alike. What chauvinist pigs we w ere! But, you must admit, we were not alone in our error. Many a woman has reaced a certain age without be ing aware that she was the victim  of sexist language. She probably talked it herself. It is only recently that her consciousness has been raised and she has come to see that using "" man""  and "" Be""  to designate a human being without distinction of sex is a studied insult to women. But now the dawn has come and we all see -- do we not? -- that in fairness we must always use "" person""  and "" he or she""  instead of the old, offensive "" man""  and "" he."" "" A ll persons are created equal""  lacks the crispness of Jefferson's phrase, but it says exactly what it means. There is some loss to Shakespeare's poetic quality in saying, "" What a piece of work is per son!""  There is a definite loss in making the Psalm ist ask, "" What is person that Thou art mindful of him or her?"" But this may not be too high a price to pay for sexual equality. When w e come to Alexander Pope's line, "" Presume not God to scan; the proper study of personkind is person,""  however, we can't help feel ing that something has gone wrong with the way we use the English tongue. What has gone wrong is the fem inists' insistence that "" man""  and "" he""  refer exclusively to the m ale sex. In fact, the prim ary meaning of "" man""  is "" human being.""  The name of our species is Man, and it is applied only secondarily to the two sexes. What, after all, is "" woman""  but the word "" man""  with a prefix ( "" wo"" ) meaning "" fem ale?""  If we want to reform  the English language, we'd do better to keep "" man""  as referring to any human be ing, m ale or fem ale, and to think up a prefix meaning "" m ale""  that we can put before "" man""  to correspond to the "" wo""  in "" woman."" The obvious prefix to use would be "" m ale.""  But palling half the human race "" malemen""  would suggest that the Post O ffice is even more overstaffed than it really is. A  better solution would be to use the Latin word "" vir.""  It is an unambiguous word that means "" adult m >>i>> human being""  and nothing else. I propose, therefore, that from now on we call adult males "" virm en""  to distinguish them from  women. The beauty of this new word is that, when pronounced rapidly, it sounds just like "" verm in,""  which is what feminists want to call us anyhow. W e males, on the other hand, can take com fort in the thought that "" virm en""  calls attention to both our virility and our virtue. The new word w ill please both sides and make everyone happy. Then we can go back to saying that all men are created equal without feeling guilty about it. Frank Patrick Is a political science professor at an Eastern college."

By John Dzurinko,"February 3 was registration day, and 262 students registered late. Reasons for this behavior are manifold. They range from extraneous circumstances, such as weather, to students purpose ly extending their vacations.

Those who do not have valid reasons pay a sm all financial penalty, which covers the ad m in istrative costs o f late registration. Most students w ill ingly accept this punishment, and the issue is forgotten. The practice of using financial penalities for late registration, however, is a minor symptom of a m ajor problem.

PS,"person's individuality. The fact that money can mean special privilege places great importance on the educational process at Bucknell. It also palls into question the underlying suc cess of Bucknell, and of other colleges and universities, in awakening consciousness and m oral responsibility -- both on a personal level and a communal level. This is essential in preventing abuse of power. A  liberal arts education is sup posed to help students ap preciate the finer things in life which cannot be purchased with money. Yet how appealing to most students is monetary suc cess in the nonacademic world? And what w ill be sacrificed for it? Throughout our society, it is gen era lly accepted that a measure of the value we place on anything is the price we w ill p a y fo r it . U t i l i t a r i a n cost/benefit analysis follows from this theory: "" I f the benefits of breaking the rule may outweigh the costs, I choose to break the rule.' It is hoped, however, that any external coercive measures, whether financial or not, in con junction with the educational process, w ill lead to the develop ment of an internal state of con sciousness of high m orality. It would be highly unfortunate if, after four years at Bucknell, one's values were abandoned for a pay check or career op- port unities.Certain human prin ciples are founded on values which money can transform. Consider how many tim es we have heard "" the best things in life are free."" The late registration fee serves as a rem inder that finan cial payment does not cleanse the soul of irresponsible actions, histead, it is a means o f attain ing virtue which can neither be bought or sold.

A week with opera draws to a close,"The Pittsburgh Chamber Opera Theater will conclude a two-week residency at Bucknell and Susquehanna Universities with an English production of Mozart's "" C qsu Fan Tutte"" (Women Are Like That) at 8 p.m. Saturday in Susquehanna' s Chapel Auditorium. Tickets are 85.50 or free with a student I.D. and are available at the Universi ty Center box office. The company began its stay on campus Monday. Under, the direction of former Metropolitan star Mildred Miller Posvar, the group offers young, dynamic singers who sing foreign arias in English for the benefit of students unfamiliar with opera. In addi tion to Saturday's performance, the artists presented Mozart's chamber opera "" The Music Master"" on Monday and per formed in conjunction with the student chorus in Wednesday night's "" A Night at the Opera."" In keeping with the goals of the Artist Series, the company pro vided a variety of supplementary activities for interested students."

"NEW YORK, N.Y.","By LYNNE RUTHERFORD The dark era of communist witch hunts and Mc- Carthyism will be recreated in a theatrical produc tion in Tustin Gym at 8:30 p.m. Saturday and Sun day. A project of Visiting Assistant Professor of Theater and English Jeffry Walker, the production is entitled "" The American Way"" and was inspired by Eric Bently's play, "" Are You Now or Have You Ever Been"" -- a probe into the effect the communist scare had on the show business community. As a graduate student, Walker had studied and acted in the piece, but this production goes beyond the realm of writers and actors and includes clips from periodicals as recent as last month and quota tions from new political speeches. The cast of 23 is comprised of students, faculty and town residents, who will portray such luminaries as Albert Einstein, Zero Mostel, and Berthold Brecht. Among those participated are Pro fessor of English Karl Patten, Instructor in Political Science Linda Thomas, and Professor of Political Science Gene Chenoweth. "" We wanted to explore the variety of testimony, the different ways in which individuals handled the confrontation. They are vastly different--some became friendly to the committee, some took the fifth amendment and refused to testify,""  Walker said. In selecting material, Walker -- now on a year's leave of absence -- and co-ordinator Douglas Allchin '79 sifted through newspaper clippings, par ty platforms and magazines from 1938 to this year. "" The American Way"" became a study of the con frontation between intellectuals and conservatives that began in 1938 and continues to this day, ac cording to Walker. The participants hope, in turn, that the project will generate discussion among all who see it and the University community in general, he said. While Walker dislikes labels, his brand of theater deals more openly with contemporary issues than that most students are used to. In many ways, the election of Ronald Reagan and his already Implemented plans to pursue the formation of in telligence committees prompted "" The American Way."" "" Reagan and other right-wing politicians talk about and have begun to reinstitute groups on inter nal surveillance, and it reminded me of this previous period in our history. It seemed we assured ourselves that McCarthyism was over, yet nowjt seems that it is more fundamental to our government than we care to admit,"" Walker said."

Bromberg to star in,
evening of acoustics,
"David Bromberg will come to campus Feb. 28 to headline ""An Evening of Acoustic Music.",
Showtimes are 7:30 and 10:30 p.m.,"By AMY KENNEDY Folk artist David Bromberg will bring his musical talents to Coleman Theatre in a concert entitled "" An Evening of Acoustic Music with David Bromberg."" The show will be Feb. 28 with two performances at 7:30 and 10:30 p.m. Ticket price is $5. Recently, Bromberg released "" My Own House,""  an album which placed him in the position of producer and performer. By doing so, Bromberg left the electronically orchestrated recordings that were present in previous albums and returned to the acoustic guitar selections that earned him his name. Philadelphia bom, Bromberg grew up in Tarrytown, N.Y. In spired by the work of Pete Seeger, he began studying guitar at age 13. Eventually, he was drawn to Greenwich Village NY during the Coffeehouse era"
C and D's 4Our Town' begins production,"of the 1%0's. B rom berg's extraordinary guitar picking and exceptional stylistic range brought him to the attention of many other musicians. Before striking out on his own with a solo album, Bromberg appeared on 72 other albums with performers like Bob Dylan, Ringo Starr and jazz artist Jerry Jeff Walker. Such versatility prompted New York Times jazz critic John S. Wilson to write "" He fits no pigeonholes. He is part of everything contem porarily musical. He is a prod uct of blues, country, jazz, folk and classical music."" Slowly, Bromberg's popularity has climbed and he has become a favorite in concert halls, nightclubs and colleges across the nation. In addition to pure musical prowess, Bromberg at tempts to become personally in volved with his audience by tell ing anecdotes and jokes. The Bucknell Concert Commit tee, troubled often by financial problems in the past, is banking on Bromberg's current populari- The cast has been set for Thornton Wilder's "" Our Town,"" Cap and Dagger's fourth theatrical venture of the year. Auditions were held Monday and Tuesday for the March 13, 14 and 15 production. Included in the cast are Barry Fishel '81 as the Stage Manager, William Walters '82 as Dr. Gibbs, Assistant Director of Annual Giv ing Susan Hagerty '80 as Mrs. Gibbs, Gwyn English '81 as Emily Gibbs, Jeff Lechlecter '84 as George Gibbs, Nancy Sanford '84 as Rebecca Gibbs, Patrick Pedro '81 as Mr. Webb, Ingrid Wills '83 as Mrs. Webb, area resident Elly Harris as Wally Webb and Associate Professor of English Anthony Gosse as Professor Willard. Also Peter Margulis '82 as Howie Newsome, Mifflinburg residents Norman and Jason Rip- pon as Joe and Si Crowell, Heather Sawyer '83 as Mrs. Soames, Dave Hancock '84 as Con stable Warren, Steve Schroko '82 as Sam Craig, T.J. Wilkison '81 as Joe Stoddard and Watsontown resident Jim Denton as Simon Stimson. The play will be directed by Allen Haines '81, an economics major fnom Allentown, Pa. Lighting will be designed by David Polsky '81 and sets will be designed by graduate student Debra Slade. Bruce Delaplane '82 will be the stage manager with assistance from Jackie Krull'83. First produced in 1938, "" Our Town,""  won the Pulitzer Prize for drama that year. Set in a small village in turn of the century rural America, the play deals sensitively with sim ple, daily events in the cycle of life and death. In Wilder's own words, it represents "" an at tempt to find a value above all price for the smallest events in our daily life."" "" Our Town""  will represent a departure from this year's earlier works. Unlike "" Tar- tuffe""  or "" A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum,""  the sparity of set design designated by Wilder will challenge actors to create a small town environment without use of lavish scenery. Cap and Dagger's next mainstage produc tion will be "" The Rivals"" , set for presentation in early May. In addition, students in direc ting class have selected one act plays for presentation in spring Cocktail Theaters. ty and much heralded charisma to remain solvent. "" We're very pleased with the popularity the show is receiving and tickets are going fast,""  ac cording to David Biggar '82, stage manager for the commit- tec* "" Coleman Theater's size (1200 seats) is perfect for this show because Bromberg especially enjoys small audiences,""  Biggar said. Guitarist Rich Getz and fiddler Steve Tristan will perform prior to each of Bromberg's per formances."
Wessman installation adds mystery to the Gallery,"By DOUGLAS ALLCHIN There's a "" contraption""  occupying the Center Gallery on the third floor of the University Center. At least it may appear so to someone uninitiated to installations. Installations are a relatively new art form. Sometimes sculptural and sometimes architectural, they are designed exclusively for one area and highlight that space. Massachusetts artist Ann Peters Wessman has created such a work for the Center Gallery, which went on display Monday and will be in the Gallery through March 3. It is a series of hanging strips 10 feet tall, 8 feet wide, and 20 feet long, which form a double funnel shaped tunnel. An odd sight at first, the hanging corridor invites you to enter and pass through -  and that you should. The way to appreciate the work is to investigate it. "" Passing through the work is part of the experience. I d rather people do it and Interact with the piece,""  Wessman said. Perhaps you walk along one side, look through, and watch the rhythmic breaking of images out the window, or your own reflec tion at night. Perhaps you discover the holes which pierce the se quence of layers. Or perhaps you notice the fibrous torn edges or the light as it penetrates the distinctive fabric, which is actually a thick form of paper covered with shellack to make it the color of skin. , .. The work expresses ideas which appear in Wessman s earlier works as well. The human quality of fabric and paper as architec tural forms, the security of tight spaces, the dynamics of light and layers of visibility have been a part of her previous work. The works on exhibit in the library are interesting complements. Here, Wessman used cigarettes to bum In her patterns. "" Cigarettes are one of the few things that will bum paper without totally crumbling it,"" Wessman said. The main installation, as it reveals space and light -- the inten tion is that it be seen at different times of the day is successful. Her work is strangely monumental, yet also personal. It intrigues, and for those not familiar with the experience, it is well worth a detour to the third floor. Photo--Landes Rosenberrv"
The paper strips of Ann Wessman's Center Gallery installation absorb light from both artificial,
sources and the window. Part of the appreciation of the piece comes from passing through it.,

Peter Shaw '84 as Hero and Barry Fishel '81 as Pseudolus gawk,
"after courtesans in last weekend's ""A Funny Thing Happened",
"on the Way to the Forum.""","is a pretty thin piece of work. The "" boy meets girl; boy can't have girl; boy finally gets girl""  plot is simple and silly, while the score is nice but undistinguished. By TODD G. BUCHHOLZ I'm sure there were a few pretentious snobs who left "" A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum,""  calling it trivial and a waste of their precious time. But they were warned. Right from the first number we are told "" tragedies tomorrow, comedy tonight; morals tomor row, comedy tonight.""  And the cast delivers. Directed by James Denton Jr. of Watsontown, "" Forum"" -- presented Feb. 5-8 -- is a hilarious musical full of gags and double entendres that provide continuous laughter. In a way, "" Forum""  is a collection of the most familiar comedic stunts of the 20th century. There's a chase scene, a haughty wife and a philandering husband, a vaudevillian song ("" Everybody Ought to Have a Maid"" ) and some imitations of Paul Lynde, Groucho Marx and Goldie Hawn. It is a very loose and very funny production. Written by Shevelove and Gelbart and with music by Stephen Sondheim, the play itself Such a veneer of a play forces the company itself to provide its own style and substance. And this is where Cap and Dagger shines. Sometime in January when the play was rehearsed, Denton -- now directing his second Jan Plan production f e  must have told his players to "" have a good time on stage"" and volunteer new material to the 1966 libretto. The results are some antics more reminiscent of the 1970s than the 1960s -- when the play was writ ten -- or of the time of the Roman Empire, when the story takes place. Ana there are some stellar per formances. Pedro and Fishel shine in their juggled roles as S e n e x , t h e h e n p e c k e d philanderer, and as Pseudolus, the slave who wins his freedom if can deliver the beautiful virgin courtesan to his young master, Hero. Both Fishel and Pedro per form equally well in a vital role that requires fine comic timing. Throughout the play Pseudolus bounces barbs and witticisms off various straightmen. Freshman Peter Shaw's version of the adolescent male -- unsure of himself, nervously pacing and stomping his feet -- is im pressive. The most unusual character to visit the stage of Coleman Theatre recently is Marcus Lycus, an unctuous owner and seller of exotic women. Played superbly and smoothly by Bob Fessler '84, Lycus seems to ooze and slide about the set as he demonstrates his assortment of courtesans. With seductive and often effeminate mannerisms ac companied by a voice that squeals into the stratosphere, Lycus is the perfect sleaze. David Blackman '82 performs masterfully as the the frenzied Hysterium, the head slave. Fidgety and jittery, Blackman _"
am--,"darts from one side of the stage to the other. His rendition of "" I'm Calm"" reveals a pleasant voice and a good sense of timing as the tempo spasmodically changes. A friendly rapport with the au dience is generated throughout the "" Forum"" . Several times the players directly address the viewers. At one point Pseudolus turns to the crowd and asks: "" Do you hear this? Are you listen ing?""  During a chase scene that involves most of the cast, characters run through the au dience. During all performances, Fishel and Pedro as Pseudolus sat down in an empty chair, turned to theatergoers next to them and asked what they thought of the show. Billed as a musical comedy, "" Forum"" seems much more comedic than melodic. Sond heim's score is sometimes superfluous and often dull. The cast, however, includes several strong voices, especially among females, as Carrie Wilshusen '84 in the role of Domina and Karen Spizziri's '82 mellifluous soprano resonated for seconds after the last note of her songs. Under the baton of Visiting Assistant Pro fessor of Music Christopher McGahan, the orchestra provid ed fine support, particularly dur ing the jazzy dance routines of the courtesans in the first act. "" Forum""  is not an enlightening play. If there's a social message intended to alter our perception of mankind or the cosmos, it was drowned out by chuckles. But despite the triteness of the work, quite a few funny things did hap pen on the way to the forum.

JE F F  CROSS,"While the loadest noise on campus has been the clatter of feet into Bertrand Library that signals the start of a new semester, the Ice Hockey Club has been making a bang at its home rink in Sunbury. The Nukes have outscored opponents 108-40 in rolling to an 8-3-1 record and stand second in the Susquehanna Valley Hocky League with a 6-3 league mark. The skaters recorded another successful week with a 4-4 tie with undefeated Dickinson Tues day, a 16-2 rout of Juniata Mon day and a 54 loss to league leading Sunbury Saturday. Fired up by their impressive victory over Juniata, Bucknell travelled to Mechanicsburg Tuesday to battle arch-rival Dickinson in the renewal of the Challenge Cup. Last year the teams split 4-3 decisions before deadlocking 7-7 in the rubber match. Before the boisterous Dickin son crowd, the Nukes quickly took control and broke the ice"

However the Red Devils evened the contest less than a minute later as the action con tinued fast and furious. Bucknell retook the lead when Bill Lightfoot '82 scored off a scramble in front of the Dickin son cage. High scoring center Remi Johnson '83 assisted on the play- In the middle of the period Cross carried the puck over the blue line, dropped a pass to Speer who fed Stalio Boyd '80 cutting in on the left side. Boyd slid the puck under the Dickin son goalie to give the Nukes a 3-1 advantage. The Red Devils narrowed the Bucknell lead to 3-2 when Bruce Cross scored on a break away late in the first period. The hard hitting continued in the second period and both teams had scoring chances thwarted by fine goaltending or watched their shots sail inches wide of the nets. The Nukes went up 4-2 midway through the period when Ron Reynier '82 blasted in a slap shot from the left side. Johnson and flashy, defenseman Paul Devlin '83 received assists on the Bucknell power play goal. Again Dickinson battled back, scoring twice more before the end of the period to send the teams to the locker rooms deadlocked at 44. Throughout the final 17 minutes the Nukes controlled the play but couldn't crack the defensive wall set up by the Red Devils. Meanwhile, defensemen Devlin, Bill Grennon '82 and Hugh Thornhill '81 kept the Dickinson forwards at bay. As the clock ran down, # Bucknell continued to outcheck"

However an elbowing penalty to leading scorer Jeff Kaighn '83 forced the Nukes to play short- handed for the final minute, preventing any further Bucknell scoring opportunities. The physical contest ended in a hard-fought tie. On Monday, Bucknell bombed Juniata 16-2, scoring within a minute of the start of each period. Kaighn led the Nuke scorers with four goals followed by Devlin and Grennon with three, Cross with two and Boyd, Johnson, Speer and Thornhill with one each. Goaltender Ron Borcherdt '81 was outstanding in the nets, delighting the Sunbury crowd with dazzling kick saves.

Women's track shatters,
records with 3-1 mark,"By LADDIE WOOLLEY The women's indoor track team, with a 3-1 dual meet record, com peted in the Princeton Relays Saturday with no team scoring. But Coach Diane Ware was ""pleased"" with the individual results, noting ""We now have two new school records and one more individual qualifying for Easterns in addition to those who have already qualified. I'd say that was good."" Sophomore Julie Crossman qualified for the Eastern Champion ships in the two-mile with a time of 11:45. The one-mile relay team of junior Co-captains Linda Accettura and Suzanne Hecker, freshman Nancy Russo, and sophomore Laurie VanWyck qualified for the EAIAW's in 4:11. The distance medley relay team of Accettura, Hecker, and freshmen Debbie Passmore and Judy Olson also set a new team record of 13:11.07. In the shot-put, Beth Bittel '83 placed sixth out of approximately 20 teams with a throw of 12.04 meters. The track team participated in two dual meets, in January, one here at the Sports/Reereation Complex versus Georgetown and Hartwick, and the other away at Delaware with George Mason University. The home meet was a triumphant one, as Bucknell swept to first place in nine of the 14 events while amassing 83 team points. Georgetown was a distant second with 47 points and Hartwick only managed to score six. Promising freshman sprinter Russo dashed to a 7.6 win in the 60 yard dash and also captured the 220 (28.1) and the long jump (15' 9%"" ). Lonnie Fertik '83 had victories in the high jump ( 5 W )  and the 65-meter hurdles (9.6), to further demonstrate her prowess in both track and field, and placed second in the shot put (34 11 ). For tunately for Bucknell, Fertik's teammate, Bittel, won the shot put with a heave of 40'10 Accettura won the 805-meter run, and Bucknell was also victorious in the 885-yard relay, the one-mile relay, and finished second in the two-mile relay. At Delaware, the women won three events but faced a powerful George Mason team which swiped the other ten to win the meet by scoring 72 points to Bucknell's 54. The Bisons placed second in the tri-meet, defeating Delaware by the score of 78-56. Winners for the Bison were Crossman in the 5,000-meter run (19:26.4), Bittel in the shotput (39'2"") and Russo in the long jump. Other qualifiers for the Eastern Championships include Fertik in the high jump, 60-meter hurdles, and pentathlon; Laura Gaydos '83, Jean LeCates '82 and Stacey Nicholson '84 in the two-mile run; Crossman and Kathy Foster '81 in the three-mile; Olson and Karen Flanagan '84 in the mile; Bittel for the shotput; LeCates in the 3,uuu- meter, and Russo for the 55-meter dash."

By DAVE KIRKPATRICK The Men's Track team had a month of open competition highlighted by outstanding show ings in the Millrose Games, Princeton Relays and the Bucknell Open. The Bisons sent a contingent to New York City Saturday to compete in the Millrose Games. The two-mile relay team of senior Mike Debraggio, juniors Rick Sayre and Steve Bigotto, and sophomore Mark Hulme produced their best time of the year, a 7:44.4 clocking -- good enough for third place in their heat. In their section of the Princeton Relays in Princeton,"

Cagers post third straight,
in road upset at Lafayette,<< ...1 ___ 11 lU n l mQptfin By DAVE KIRKPATRICK and
MARK MITCHELL,"After a month of frustration, the men's basketball team has apparently turned itself around, and Wednesday night's 56-53 win over Lafayette put the Bisons right back in the thick of the East Coast Conference Western Division title race. The win was far from easy as the Breakin' Bisons had to overcom e a five- point Lafayette lead at halftime. Down the stretch Bucknell went continuously to cap tain A1 Leslie '81 who responded by pump ing in 17 second half points. Leslie finished with 26 points, but as is often the case in the big games, it was the unsung players who picked up the big buckets at the end of the game. The Wednesday night heroes faced a 53- 50 deficit with only 55 seconds remaining but unlike the early season frustrations with the final minutes of play, this time the last minute belonged to Bucknell. Guard Paul Adkins '81, who has established himself as the team's premier play-maker, turned scorer with a 20-foot jumper to pull the team within one point. After Bucknell called a time out, Adkins and Dave Shehadi '81 cam e up with a steal off the full court pressure, and Shehadi's driving layup gave Bucknell the lead at 54- 53 with 25 seconds remaining. Lafayette's last ditch effort to pull out a victory fell short when Jim Whitman miss ed a long jumper and 6-7 junior Deb Okorodudu snared his game-high ninth re bound. Okorodudu was immediately foul ed, and despite a Lafayette timeout and the deafening din created by the Leopard faithful, Okorodudu sank both free throws to give Bucknell the final 56-53 margin The win meant a continuation of a modest ihree game win streak that has propelled Bucknell back into the chase for western division title. The streak began with a 62-55 overtim e victory Feb. 4 over Rider -- the current leader of the division -- and included a 54-44 defeat of Lehigh Saturday, in Bethlehem. Senior Mike Page played a big role in each of the wins, scoring 15 against Rider and 16 against Lehigh, both team highs. Leslie added 13 points in the Rider win, and Okorodudu had 10 points, nine re bounds, and a career high four blocked shots. Okorodudu has blocked 16 shots in the last eight games, and leads the ECC with a 1.3 average. Against Lehigh, Okorodudu had 12 points and 11 rebounds, while Leslie had 10 points and Ray Moss '83 had 10 points and 13 re bounds. Leslie now stands within five points of the career scoring record of Bob Barry, '80 and is within nine free throws of the career record for that category. January was a month of frustration for the Bisons. The first Bucknell win in the conference didn't com e until the Delaware match Jan. 28. Leslie had 18 points against the Blue Hens including six free throws down the stretch to spark the 51-45 triumph. The next time out the Bisons turned hapless West Chester into winners for the first time this season, falling 84-75. Bucknell had a season high 24 turnovers and struggled to a 41 percent night from the floor, but Leslie scored 15 points and Page and Shehadi each added 12 points. Photo--David Hawkings"

Grapplerspin three foes as Mays and Greenly shine,"ByDANPICARDI The wrestling team scored impressive victories at home Saturday by soundly defeating both Rutgers 28*15 and Franklin & Marshall 25-17 to improve its record to 5-7. Head Coach Robert Ferraro had only praise for his team. "" As a whole the team wrestled very well. Steve Greenly '82, John Stoner '82 and Doug Mays '81 were ex ceptional,""  he said. raptain Mays and Stoner rewrote the record books as they recorded the fastest pins in Bucknell history--126 and 167 pounds respectively. Mays walked off the mat victorious after only 45 seconds while Stoner took just 67 seconds to dispose of his Rutgers opponent. The Bisons registered three other pins in the meet, as Greenly nailed down both his opponents while Mark Baker '82 pinned his F&M foe. Ferraro was also quick to cite "" the steady improve ment of the underclassmen."" With Saturday's double win, the Bisons have regained their winning ways after coming off a very competitive January. In a five-day tour of the south, they lost to William & Mary 24-18, East Carolina 22-18, North Carolina State 31-9 and Navy 41-10. NC State and Navy are ranked in the top 20 in the nation. Coach Ferraro said the team performed well consider ing the competition, and pointed out as the highlight Greenly's match against the defending national cham pion at NC State, to whom Greenly lost by a single point. Returning home, the Bisons downed Lycoming 30-15 Jan. 20 and Colgate 24-19 Feb. 4. Sandwiched hetween the two wins, Bucknell travelled to West Chester along with Hofstra and Drexel for a four-team competition to open the ECC regular season. Hofstra is the defending conference champion while Bucknell finished fourth in the competition hosted here last spring. Bucknell emerged victorious over Hofstra 28-11 but lost to Drexel 25-14 and West Chester 22-14. Mays, at 126 pounds, and Greenly, alternating be tween the 177 and 190 pound classes, both won all three of their matches. Both Mays and Greenly now sport 164 overall records. Baker earned two wins -- one each at 177 and 190 -- and Wally Zimmerman '83 had a win and a draw at 142. The Bisons host Delaware and American at noon Saturday in Davis Gym. Last season, Bucknell trounced Delaware 34-9 but did not wrestle American."

"Vol. 87, No. 2 Bucknell University, Lewisburg, Pa.",
"$1,106 tuition increase passed",ByBILLTHUM NEW YORK--The Executive Commit tee of the University Board of Trustees voted unanimously late Thursday night to approve a $1106 increase in tuition and fees
for,
the,"1981-82 academic year. The decision, arrived at during a five- hour meeting at the University Club here, officially ended the six-month debate on the tuition question. The trustees had little problem sup porting the 15.2 percent increase--the largest in the University's history-but heatedly debated the distribution of the funds. The debate centered on either sup porting large increases in wage and salary totals or the possibility of increasing undergraduate student aid, University President Dennis O'Brien said. Although the 15th alternative to the budget provided a 14.5 percent increase in faculty compensation, Chairman of the"
Faculty salaries increase,"___ . ... _ _____ lias in the nast. been criticized for the lo Faculty David Ray and Chairman of the University Committee on Planning and the Budget, Stephen Becker, called for an ad ditional 1 percent hike, citing last year s inequities and soaring inflation, Ray said. Interest in increasing student aid was the result of many trustees' fears that Bucknell would ""become an elitist institu tion""  due to such large tuition increases and President Reagan's announcement of federal budget cuts in the area of private education, trustee Jane Maas '53 said. Although financial aid currently affects only 26 percent of the student body, University Provost Wendell Smith said a like increase in aid in relation to the fee hike will prevent Bucknell from falling back on financial aid. Also., while Bucknell has in the past been criticized for the low level of federal aid it receives, this situa tion will cushion the effects of Reagan s policies. Only $245,000 out of $27 million budget represents federal student aid grants now, Zeller said. Concerning faculty salaries, the trustees recognized Bucknell faculty were serious ly underpaid last year and that-in addi tion to the across the board increases to off-set inflation--a larger catch-up was needed to improve morale, O'Brien said. In this light, the trustees moved to in crease faculty compensation by 5% per cent to 15 percent. This represents the same increase as proposed by the faculty during their December meeting. Although faculty compsnsation was In creased, an additional increase was not made in the comprehensive fee, Ray said. "" This will put pressure on Zeller to keep an already extremely tight budget in the black,"" Ray said. This will be especially difficult considering the needs of replacing the student medical director and purchase of a new word processor, among other things which have not been accounted for, Zeller said. Reaction of the trustees was subdued but positive. Trustee David Trout said although the increase in tuition and fees is high, "" it is not out of line with our frame of reference schools and it begins to correct the inequities of last year's budget."" Trustee Beverly Dunston '52 said the most important part of any academic institution is the maintenance of a strong faculty, and See TRUSTEES, page 7."

fail to reach accord on contract,"# << m u <<  r t f f i n o r c  a r p By MATT KARAN IAN After six months of contract negotiations between the University and Campus Security, the two have yet to ratify a pact and are a "" long way from acon- tract"" according to security Corporal Ed Roberts. The security officers, who are collectively represented by the United Plant Guard Workers of America (UPGWA), reached "" verbal agreement with the University at a negotiating session last month, according to Vice President for Administra tion and Finance John Zeller. The University drafted a contract for the group, and at this stage, the employees are expected to for mally ratify or reject the agreement.

The proposed contract is a "" simple straight forward contract"" which involves "" strictly wages and benefits"" according to Zeller. He said he could not discuss its specific provisions until a contract is ratified. . . ,,,, One of the requests the officers made was for an hourly pay rate of $7.50 per hour for day patrolmen, Roberts said Thursday. They are currently paid $4.90 per hour, with a 15 cent hourly increment for night patrols. , . . .. Roberts said the officers also asked for the right to carry handguns, and for the training to use them. They also asked for a "" firearms policy"" because "" when you get a call you don't know what's there till you get there."" . Because the officers want to carry guns does not mean they want to act like "" cowboys"" or to ' play cops"" Roberts said.

Trustees increase the,
student activities fee,
from $46 to $52,"By LAURA CARMELICH An ABS proposal to raise the Student Activities Fee from $46 to $52 was approved by the Ex ecutive Committee of the Univer sity Board of Trustees in New York Thursday night. The recommendation was presented to the trustees at the close of Thursday's meeting by ABS President Michael Suarez '82, and the trustees asked no questions after Suarez's brief presentation. They gave their unanimous approval immediate ly- Suarez said the increase in the fee was warranted and that he had anticipated no problems in receiving approval from the com mittee. The ABS Congress voted 18-3 at its Wednesday night meeting to ask for the $6 increase--the first hike in the Student Activities Fee in four years. The increase will help provide an "" improvement in the quality of activities"" at Bucknell, as well as create "" viable social alter natives to fraternity functions,"" Suarez said. There presently ex ists a "" tyranny of non-choice"" on campus and Suarez added "" we are hoping money will make more choice."" The allocation of the $46 fee presently paid by every student is as follows: $5 to the Financial Aid Office to be applied to a special scholarship fund, $1 to the Office of Student Activities, $1 to the Committee on Student Pro grams, and $1 to each class. The remaining $38 is distributed to all other campus organizations and events which serve the Bucknell community. The allotment of $5to the Finan cial Aid scholarships will con tinue, although the ABS Congress decided at its meeting Wednes day to set up a task force to ex amine the distribution of these scholarships by the Financial Aid Office The ABS now has no say in the criteria for or the selection of the recipients of these scholarships. The Office of Student Activities and COSP will also continue to receive $1 each from every stu dent's activity fee, while the amount given to each class will be raised from $1 to $2. According to Suarez, if class activities were organized properly and aided by these additional funds, they could help create the "" sense of com munity""  the ABS would like to promote at Bucknell. In addition to boosting the quali ty of student life, the increased fee will be used as a type of back up fund for the ABS Reserve Account, he said. The ABS erases any debts acquired by student organizations at the end of each year. The cost of absorbing these debts varies from year to year, however, and cannot be accurate ly predicted, according to Suarez. For instance, last year the Con cert Committee had an unusually unsuccessful season that left them with a $16,000 debt which the ABS had to absorb. Suarez admits that "" in a way"" anticipating these debts leads to "" padding""  the Reserve Account. But he feels such a safety valve is "" very, very necessary."" Suarez has been quick to point out that while the additional funds are necessary to keep pace with the increase in Bucknell's social alternative organizations and their rising service costs, money is "" only part of the solu tion."" By adopting a stricter attitude toward groups who run over their budgets and by charging club dues to organizations that do not provide a service to the Universi ty, Suarez said he hopes to "" keep waste to a minimum."" In this way ABS funds may be used more efficiently and -- he hopes -- "" more creatively."" Photo-- Betsy Bogwill"
The former lounge in Vedder Hall shown above is one of four the Office of Residential Life,
has had converted into additional double rooms in order to alleviate a housing shortage,
caused this semester--allegedly by a decrease in the number of students studying off-,
campus.,
Overcrowded dormitories result o f,
I,
fewer students studying off-campus,"by JAN BALAKIAN The Office of Residential Life has been forced to convert lounges into rooms to accommodate an in crease in the number of students on campus this semester. In response to greater requests for residential hall space, Associate Director of Residential Life Gerald Commerford has converted four lounges in Vedder Hall and one lounge in Swartz Hall into double rooms. Although there were originally 36 extra room requests, the loss of December graduates and the attrition which normally occurs in the spring semester has compensated for the re mainder of the extra requests, Commerford said. "" I reluctantly made the decision to use the lounges and I will accommodate the students af fected by my decision as soon as there are rooms available,"" he said. Part of the problem stems from a decline in the number of students who normally study off- campus during second semester. University Registrar Bruce Freed said 93 students studied off-campus last semester while only 58 are doing so this semester. This represents a significant decline from the 114 students who studied off- campus during second semester last year, Freed said. Associate Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences John Pyper said a trip to London and Athens was proposed last spring for this semester. However, the University Committee on Planning and the Budget concluded that it was not approved in time to be included in this year's budget, Pyper said. The proposal for this program recommended that 45 additional students be involved in off- campus study. Enrollment has not been a factor in the lack of room s, Freed said. The enrollment for undergraduates this semester is 3118, a decrease from the 3130 students of last semester. This decrease is off-set by the number of students stu dying off-campus which brings campus enroll ment to 3037 this semester as compared to 3060 for last semester. This represents no significant in crease from the enrollment total of 3005 undergraduates for second semester of last year, Freed said. Director of Residential Life Brenda Gordon said a similar shortage of housing was confronted in 1972 when Bucknell needed 185 extra beds. The solution then was the construction of Bucknell West. However, now there is no prospect for a new dormitory, Gordon said. "" Right now we are trying to maintain and improve the quality of what we have. We are not financially capable of building a new dorm,"" Gordon said. ___________"

line other young saplings in addition to this one--planted in front of the Olin Science Building,

Christmas vacation. Students swinging on the trees has been attributed as the cause.,
Juvenile behavior sharply criticized,"By JOHN DZURINKO Ten trees worth a total of $328 have been vandalized at various loca tions on campus since Christmas, according to Physical Plant Grounds Foreman George Trutt. . Acting Chief of Security Michael Amarante said the cause of tne destruction is swinging and pulling on the fragile saplings, winch range in age from 1 to 5 years. Since the vandalism usually occurs at night, it is difficult to determine who is involved, Amarante said. If caught destroying the trees, the suspect is prosecuted for cnmmal mischief by the University in conjunction with Lewisburg District Magistrate Leo Armbruster, Amarante said. The penalties include replacement costs of the tree, court fees and a fme. Kappa !sigma fraternity members were involved in a similar case mvwvmg a Lewisburg citizen's evergreen tree in late December. (See story on P TOe destruction of trees is a perennial problem at Bucknell and in curs an estim ated annual cost of $1000, Trutt said, some especially when you consider the costs involved in planting and maintaining the trees in addition to those of replacement, he said. Vice President for Administration and Finance John Zdler said such destructive behavior usually stems from drunkenness. Trutt said the vandalism renresents a form of "" childish, expensive fun."

Times to publish guide to colleges,
They hope to compete with Yale's Insider's Guide to Colleges,"By MARY LISA MURGIANO The New York Times has solicited 25 University students through the office of Secretary of the University William Weist to help them compile a guide to colleges and universities. . . . The New York Times Guide to Colleges' will include short essays on approximately 225 schools including Bucknell. The book is intended to help high school students choose the ""right"" college. According to Times Education Editor Edward B. Fiske, there is a need for a ""comprehensive"" college guide that will help students to differentiate between schools. ""Our assumption is that selecting a college is a matching pro cess. No school is right for everyone,"" Fiske said. Fiske contacted Weist and requested that a ""represen tative sample"" of students be chosen to complete ques tionnaires about the University. The responses are being collected and will be edited and included in the guide. According to Weist, the questionnaires were supposed to be distributed during the semester while all students were on campus and a ""representative sample"" could be selected. However, the mailing arrived late in December, after students had left campus. Weist said the surveys were distributed during January to a group of students selected by Assistant Director of Annual Giving Robert Kallin and Philip Andrews '81. The Times requested that students with varying majors, grades and interests be selected, Weist said. Andrews says he is not sure whether it was wise for the Times to solicit students through an administrator who could control which students responded. According to An drews, he played a major role in selecting students only because he was personally acquainted with Weist. ""There is a danger in choosing people who tend to be like you,"" Andrews said. Fiske said the selection procedure was ""deliberately vague"" in order to accommodate all schools and ""not im pose any more than was necessary. "" The survey consisted of 50 questions, and respondents were asked to describe the strength of academic depart ments, the variety of course offerings, the workload, cam pus social life and the atmosphere of the cafeteria, in addi tion to"
other,"aspects of the University. The last questions dealt with the sort of student who ""should come"" to a particular school and which ones ""should go elsewhere."" Other subjective questions asked if there were any ways ""in which your college does not fit its popular image and if the respondent would ""come again."" Andrews and Weist agreed the questionnaire was fair and was designed to be taken seriously. ""It was a profes sional questionnaire,"" Weist said. ' According to Andrews, ""It was a well-constructed survey that will probably paint a broad but accurate pic ture. It was very open-ended. They didn't load or slant the ^ Weist compared the Times guide to ""The Comparative Guide to American Colleges"" and ""The Insider's Guide to the Colleges 1981-82."" The Insider's guide, compiled by the Yale Daily News, ""began as a fun project but ended by degrading some schools,"" he said. Andrews predicts that the Times guide will not be ""as dry as Barron's Profiles. It is informative but not flippant like Yale's and will probably be similar to a New York Times editorial,"" he said. Fiske contrasted the Times guide with Yale's Insider s guide, Barron's ""Profiles of American Colleges"" and Lovejoy's ""College Guide."" ""We feel that although the Yale guide is good, it is perhaps not as systematic as it could be. Our guide is similar to Yale's in that it tries to distinguish between schools and their suitability for various types of students."" Fiske added that Barron's and Lovejoy's are written as encyclopedias whereas the Times guide will be more ' 'comprehensive and descriptive. ' ' Yale's ""Insider's Guide to Colleges"" describes the University as ""more or less a professional, Establishment school for nice kids from nice families who will do almost anything to land a job with a good company and precious little to do anything else of value."" The article was written by Alan Levine '80, the only student who submitted a writ ten contribution to the editors of the guide.

Trustees conclude first stage,
of presidential assessment,"By LISA CERUTI The Commission on Presidential Assessment, an ad hoc committee of the University's Board of Trustees, has concluded the first stage of its review and assessment of University President Dennis O'Brien's first five years here. Members of the committee met here last weekend and the weekend of Jan. 23-24 to conduct interviews with members of the administration, faculty and student body concerning their evaluations of O'Brien. Last fall, Vice Chairman of the Board and Chair man of the Assessment Committee Samuel Woolley invited the faculty and administration to submit "" input"" on O'Brien's review. The committee has received information through interviews and written statements from 101 people. Woolley said that -- in his committee's request for evaluation -- they asked that respondents concen trate on four major areas of assessment. The areas are leadership, decision-making, administration and suggestions for the future. The purpose of the assessment, which was re quested by O'Brien at the time of his appointment in 1976, is to use the experiences and outcomes of the past five years to help plan for the future, according to Woolley. Florence Pyle, secretary for the committee, said the group is now beginning to compile the informa tion they have collected. "" Their next step is to draft a preliminary report and discuss it with the Presi dent,""  Pyle said. Woolley said his committee will meet with O'Brien to review the report and make any necessary clarifications.

responsible campus drinking habits,"ByM.E.

Members of "" Students Con cerned for Responsible Drink ing"" include representatives of the Interfratemity Council, the"

for a contract,"From CAMPUS, page 1. desire to carry weapons was based partly in principle. "" They ask me to answer these calls but they don't trust me with a gun,"" Roberts said. The patrolmen have "" never considered going on strike""  if their contractual demands are not met, because they "" can't af ford to,""  Roberts said. Instead, they are relyL their union to bargain for ti and also on the advice of an tomey whose service they have hired. Roberts would not identify the name of the law firm which he said was representing the of ficers. Tlie University has also retain ed legal advice, and has hired the New York law firm of Jackson, Lewis, Schnitzler and Crupman to assist in its dealing with the UPGWA and the officers. The attorney for the officers was retained because they wanted "" independent counsel""  in addition to^ the bargaining assistance from the union. Others have reported that the officers have had a "" falling out"" with the union officials, however, and that this is the reason for the retention of legal advice.

The group is modeled after "" Boost Alcohol Consciousness Concerning the Health of Univer sity Students""  (BACCHUS), a na tional organization which pro motes alternatives to drinking. According to Flavell, the organization encotirages "" re sponsible drinking,"" which he defines as limiting consumption of alcohol, drinking slowly, being aware of alcohol content and avoiding skilled tasks such as driving while intoxicated. The group recognizes that "" drinking is a social device and there should be an alternative. We are not a goody-goody group,""  Flavell said. Gordon said much of the van dalism that occurs on campus is drinking. "" We are stressing the caused by people who have been advisability of serving alter native beverages at social func tions,""  she said. Beth Sipple '82, a member of the organization, said the group plans to initiate an "" Alcohol Awareness Week""  next fall in ad dition to other activities. According to Sipple, the group is run primarily by students. "" Residential Life advises us but prefers that the organization con sists mainly of students. We en courage people to drink respon sibly and just be aware of how much they drink,""  Sipple said. Students Concerned for Re sponsible Drinking "" will be ap plying for ABS recognition and hopes to receive funding,"" ac cording to Flavell. The Class of '53 Lectureship--which two years ago brought Dan Rather and other high officials of CBS to the University--will return for a second time beginning next week with another media- oriented series of speaking engagements titled "" Messages from the The first speakers in the program will be NBC Vice Chairman Richard Slanat and former CBS Vice Chairman and President Frank Stanton, who will speak in the University Center Forum at 8:30 p.m. Thursday on "" Independence vs. Responsibility: Thoughts on Management."" , ____ The two media kingpins will also participate in an open classroom for University students and a news conference for the local press Friday. , . . . .  ,,,, Three other two-day programs have also been scheduled as the other components of "" Messages from the Medium ""  DianeHealey, the vice president for affiliated relations operations at the NBC Television Network, and Lorraine Wallace, an artist and writer who is married to CBS News correspondent Mike Wallace, will be on campus March 10 and 11.

CA retreat strives,
to improve listening,"By BILL THUM Concern and Action's alternative to Colloquy will be presented next weekend in a retreat focusing on improving personal relationships at Bucknell's conference center in Cowan. The retreat will focus on the problem expressed by students of the superficiality of many relationships and difficulty in dealing with others in an emotional and physical way, according to student coor dinators Katie Foster '81 and Helen Roby '82. Differing from the collo quy format--which used lectures on a specific topic over a several day period--the retreat will allow students to take time off from campus to explore one area in depth, Roby said. The retreat will focus on expanding communication through the development of listening skills using a local expert in the field as a guide, Foster said. CA has arranged for Charles E. Confer '59, a professional social worker at the Institute for the Development of Life Skills, Inc., to work with the group to develop listening skills .'Confer, who received his master's degree in social work at the University of Pittsburgh, works as a consultant for businesses and other organizations to develop ef fective communication skills, Roby said. "" A lot of people think they listen, but could learn to communicate more effectively,""  said Confer. "" The key is in learning to put oneself aside and focus on understanding and accepting what is going on inside another person."" The program is scheduled to leave campus Friday afternoon and return Saturday evening with the majority of the time to be spent in relaxing interaction, Foster said. "" Hopefully, this will set a precedent for future off-campus retreats that can focus on unlimited topics such as religion, the handicapped and minorities,"" said CA President Steve Kushner '82. . . . While the idea of Colloquy, currently in its 13th year, is not being abandoned, new needs have arisen which must be attacked in a much more personal level, Foster said. Assistant Director of Student Ac tivities and University Center Programs Ruth Burnham said she was pleased with the direction CA is taking and ""there can't be enough done to help people in their personal relationships."" Registration for the weekend closes Monday afternoon."

appeals for,
blood donors,"By KATE FOLKERS A blood shortage in this area is making it crucial to collect 300 pints during next week's Red Cross blood drive, according to drive Chairman Beth Sipple '82. Concern and Action is sponsor ing the drive from 10:45 a.m. to 4:45 p.m. Thursday in Larison Dining Hall. Many hospitals have no blood reserves and Red Cross Blood mobiles rush their blood to hospitals for immediate surgery, Sipple said. There are few qualifications for donating blood. Donors must be at least 17 years old, weigh more than 110 pounds and be in good health. Students may sign up in the < UC mall. Walk-ins are welcome on Thursday, however Sipple said."

RULE CO.. INC.,"22 Adams Ave. P.0. Box 278 COLO SPRING. N.Y. U S A .  10516 responsibilities for their actions when acting as a group,""  Com- merford said. Kappa Sig received a warning from the University in October following an incident where a pledge was hospitalized after escessive alcohol consumption on the eve of his initiation into the fraternity, according to Paul Williams '82, the fraternity's president. The decision to place Kappa Sig on probation followed an incident where eight members cut down an evergreen tree on the property of D r. G e o r g e M iller of Lewisburg. The brothers were foraging for a Christmas tree to decorate the chapter house, Williams said. Williams said he knew Kappa Sig was a "" short step""  away from probation because Commerford had told him the University was "" scared to death""  after the drink ing occurrence in October. Com merford said the incident was v i e w e d as "" f r a t e r n i t y - encouraged drinking"" but Williams said the pledge "" took it upon himself to get that drunk."" He said the chapter members were "" definitely wrong""  to cut down the tree, however. Williams accepted responsibili-"
",","ty for their actions and was fined $625 and cited for criminal m i s c h i e f  b y L e w i s b u r g Magistrate Leo Armbruster. But Williams said the fraternity paid the cost. TKE's warning stemmed from "" trashing""  a floor in Roberts Hall, according to President Steve Riggins '82. A group of TKE brothers, searching for a bronze plaque stolen from the ex terior of the house, found it on 3% Roberts and vandalized the hall, as retribution, spewing trash on the floor and turning over beds, he said."
A,"complaint was lodged against TKE with the Office of Residential Life and Commer ford put the fraternity "" on warn ing.""  Probation followed when members again caused damage in Roberts following their "" Pop- Son N i g h t "" c e l e b r a t i o n . Members of the group returned the next morning to clean up and replace three broken windows, Riggins said. R i g g i n s  s a i d f u r t h e r disciplinary action by the University against TKE was war ranted but that probation was "" perhaps too harsh.""  "" Because we were among the first, we were made an example,"" he said. Commerford said he has "" con fidence in the leadership""  of the two fraternities that the limita tions of the probation will be adhered to. He said he does not think the social restrictions will be detrimental to either fraterni ty. And, while Williams and Rig gins agreed the probation limits would be an "" inconvenience,"" neither said he thought it would affect fraternity morale."
Bomb scare clears Hunt,"A telephoned bomb threat this morning caused University officials to order the evacuation of Hunt Hall at 11 o' clock. A spokesman for Vice President for Administration and Finance John Zeller said an anonymous caller telephoned the physical plant director's office at about 10:50 am and said there was a bomb in the dormitory. She said officials did not expect any difficulty with the evacuation since many of the dorm residents were in classes. A similar threat was received a few weeks ago. The building was evacuated and a search made, but no bomb was found. , ... Lewisburg Borough Police were called this morning to assist with the evacuation and bomb search. ________"

increase,"From TRUSTEES, page 1. thus the salary hike ""was a very positive step in maintaining the acad em ic quality of Bucknell."" Faculty reaction was mixed. Ray said he was pleased with the board's decision, largely because it is a positive jesture to improve morale at the University. Becker, however, still said more needed to be done to correct past inequity and thus was not impressed by the board's efforts. Although tuition and fees re mained largely the same from the last proposal, the breakdown of funds was altered at the meeting, Zeller said. The tuition increase will drop from $950 to $900 while the room fee will in crease by $50 for a total of $100. The board increase will stay at $100, Zeller said. Thus, while tuition was actual ly decreased at the meeting, total comprehensive charges remain ed the same. In addition to increasing the tuition, the board decided, without debate, to increase the student activities fee as ABS president Michael Suarez '82 re quested. This will bring total in creases to $1106 or $8437 in com prehensive charges for 1981-82. Suarez said the trustees were very receptive to student in terests and showed a great con cern for the continuation of quali ty education at Bucknell."
ABS retreat attended by,
less than half of congress,"The Association of Bucknell Students'seminar on leadership, held Friday and Saturday at the conference center at Cowan, was attended by 18 congress members--less than half of the organization. The seminar, entitled ""People Support What They Help Create,"" was intended to outline the ""new"" congress and its team structure while developing awareness of the University community from ad ministrative, academic and social perspectives, ABS President Michael Suarez '82 said. Friday evening was devoted to discussions concerning the Universi ty and goals of the ""new"" ABS. Saturday was spent in group discus sions with University administrators to increase rapport with students and knowledge of the University in general, Suarez said. After the discussion period, the congress members regrouped to study the concepts of ""team building"" and ""brainstorming"" with Assistant Director of Student Activities and University Center Pro grams Ruth Burnham. Suarez said the team system and brainstorm ing sessions will be an integral part of his administration. The major outcomes of the weekend included plans to increase publicity on the situation of the third floor of the University Center, in crease social alternatives on campus and increase the Student Ac tivities Fee by $6 to $52. (See story on page 3.) Although officially terming the weekend a success, Suarez said a review of the retreat will be presented on Wednesday to the 23 con gress members unable to attend the seminar."

Pope gives homily,
on human rights,"Pope John Paul II gave a homi ly on human rights Tuesday in Manila's presidential palace, his host President Ferdinand Marcos seated beside him. Marcos, who is preparing for the upcoming presidential elec tion, ended more than eight years of martial law a month ago. The Pope praised the action as a good sign. The Pope emphasized that "" joint effort of all the citizens builds a truly sovereign nation,"" and urged "" a spirit of mutual respect and civic responsibility."" A large group of cabinet members, judges, dignitaries and political associates of the president made up the audience. None of the political opposition or people who held political office prior to martial law were pres ent. The Pope also visited Karachi, Pakistan Monday. Twenty minutes before he reached the stadium where he said mass, a grenade exploded in a reviewing stand, killing the man holding it and wounding three people near by. Police would not give details about the man or who his target may have been."
No obstacles found,
in Iran agreement,"No substantial legal obstacles regarding the carrying out of the terms negotiated with Iran for the release of the 52 American hostages have been found, ac cording to the Reagan Ad ministration interagency com mittee. The committee review, which took one month to complete, was sent to the White House last weekend for final discussion by President Reagan and a Cabinet- level group. Officials said while the Reagan Administration is un comfortable with some parts of the complex agreement that secured the hostages' release Jan. 20, it is expected to approve it. The completion of the review coincided with the opening of Congressional hearings on the Iran crisis and the terms of the agreement Wednesday."

In a televised speech to Con gress Wednesday night, Reagan proposed a 10 percent tax cut for 1982 and budget cuts totaling $41.4 billion in 83 major pro grams. The only area where an increase was suggested was in the defense budget. Reagan issued a challenge to those who might criticize the drastic cuts. "" Have they an alter native which offers a greater chance of balancing the budget, reducing and eliminating infla tion, stimulating the creation of jobs and reducing the tax burden?""  he asked."

Greeks need suggestions from Zeus and the gods,* * i aAMiAra in fr o fo m itv /*PS fVta nrnrlr nf hi
By Todd G. Buchholz,"The Day of Reckoning is near. Tomor row will com e the laughs and tears -- Bucknell's version of "" the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat.""  Saturday morn ing sorority hopefuls will get the salvific word. Last year 62 percent of the 338 girls who registered received a welcome to Greek life. The remainder either dropped out voluntarily or were erased from the invita tion lists. Soon after Saturday, reform sug gestions will appear and complaints will be registered by girls wondering whether they said the wrong things at cocktail par ties or m ism atched monogrammed sweaters with skirts. After reading Yale's Insider's Guide to the Colleges unenthused appraisal of Bucknell, I have concluded, with advice from the Oracle at Delphi, that the present Greek systems are hindering our surface image problems and hampering our real social difficulties. "" Parties consist mostly of mobbed fraternity affairs...""  the guide states. Regrettably, this is true. With more than 70 percent of the freshmen pledging, Greek contributions to, the campus should be greater. Yes, they provide a means for learning group cooperation and responsibility and, a medium for developing friendships. Yet more is required. Again, with such a large number committing their social lives and hundreds of dollars each to the system, the visible results should be more epic than Hawaiian Night at Sigma Alpha Epsilon or New Year's at Delta Upsilon. Personally, I subscribe to President O'Brien's interpretation of fraternal history. Fraternities were the bridge be tween youth and adulthood 70 years ago. Primarily for upperclassmen, frats were a forum to learn the ways of mature citizens"
THE,
BUCH,
STOP,"and a mode for debate -- a place where true Grecian, Aristotelian ideals were perpetuated. Of course no one denies that the Dionysian passions were unleashed oc casionally. Today, according to the thesis, frater nities are not a link between up perclassmen and the real world but the last fling of youth for underclassmen -- those final beer bottles tossed into the shrubs. But the image -- the stuffed leather chairs, the fireplaces and the friendly con versations --thrived. Witness the atrophy of participation by"
THE BUCKNELL DILEMMA,"juniors and especially seniors in fraternity functions. By the third year, the beer loses its head and the routine becomes boring. Mod parties become popular and the houses are left to the sophomores. It is time to improve the Greek life and its contributions to the campus. Perhaps changes will persuade veteran members to stay on the team, allow freshmen to try alternatives to crushing bashes, and alter the scene we depict for prospective college students. Instead of 14 Saturday night band par ties, why not a few coffeehouses in addition to the usual fare? People have lauded the success of Christy's Gate and lamented the lack of a meeting place. How about one of the beneficient frats offering its living room to the much loved orphan? And as long as drinking rules don't seem ap plicable to the Greek temples, we might even spice up the fruit drinks a bit. Carey House offers slide shows and discussions about foreign nations on Fri day afternoons. Is it inconceivable that frat houses might try to stimulate more conversation than beer pong jargon? Remember that old tum-of-the-century version; it's pretty attractive. I also suggest moving rush to second semester. While there are logistical com plications and while financial arrange ments might have to be modified, a later rush season would allow freshmen to survey other social activities before whittl ing their paddles and shining their mugs."
By Steve Diorio,"Because of the work of hundreds of volunteers, there's more to Bucknell than "" mobbed fraternity affairs""  -- but not enough. With the help of Greek leaders we could get a better review in the next edi tion of the Insider's Guide. Todd G. Buchholz '83 returns to the Buck- nollian this week with the first of this sem es ter's installments of ""The Buch Stop the column that will run in alternate weeks with Phil Andrews' ""Ph illing In."""

'Helper' goofs,"To the Editor: Friday's issue of the Bucknellian in cluded an ad announcing the production of a new play, "" The American Way."" I am very certain that the person who placed the ad had the best of intentions in doing so. For that our production was grateful. The ad was, however, very much in error in two important ways. First, the Bucknell Progressive Caucus was not at all responsible for the event. Several BPC members (of a company of 24) were involved in the production, but that was it. Second, the production was a refreshing collaborative effort Douglas Allchin '79 and m yself worked together to compile and stage the work And the actors, actresses and crew were happily an equal m ix of students Lewisburg residents and faculty Together it was our theatre; the ad' proclam ation that "" Jeff W alker Theatre Presents""  was most certainly an unfortunate mistake. The Bucknellian is not faulted here at all. It was completely a "" goof""  by an anonymous "" helper."" In fact , the company of "" The American Way""  is grateful that the paper joined with area papers in publishing other articles to help make the event a success. We thank you.

"Dicki, Davy and Greg: candidates for president?",d ____________________________ r M 4 MAAAMif WMA /1AM f
By Raymond L. Moss,"I was weaned on the notion that voting was a right that should be dutifully exer cised by every citizen. By casting a vote, I was told, I  would be making a contribution to the electoral process. H ie first tim e I can recall voting was in m y second grade class in early September 1967 when we were told by our teacher Mrs. Kalikstein that our choice for president of class 2-405 was an important position. The job called for someone with a working knowledge of the school, its teachers and students as w ell as a firm  understanding of where the up and down staircases were. I can recall the candidates quite vividly. There was Davy Avis, form er first grade class president, Dicki Ziman, the kid from California who loved to try out for school plays and skinny little Greg W alker who, weeks earlier, had transfered to our school from  someplace out in Illinois. No one in class 2-405 was very excited with any of the candidates for class president. M y classmates thought it made little dif ference whether our class president was D avy, Greg or Dicki. I recall hearing the girl next to m e in math say once: "" I want someone who can lead us up the stairs from  line-up, but none of these kids seem to know the best and fastest staircase.""  It seemed as though everyone felt uninspired by the candidates. Each candidate had several weak nesses. Davy Avis was being blamed for the 15 percent increase in the price of m ilk -- the mainstay of snacks and lunches for public school 69. No one really knew why he was responsible for the increase, but he was considered guilty because he was class president at the tim e. Davy was also having problems being re-elected because many second graders hallainxl ho In r>>kpH thp ahilitv to lead. It seemed that D avy did not get along w ell with the school's eraser monitors and stu dent crossing guards. Without the crossing guards' cooperation, Davy could not ade quately coordinate his class' line while it crossed the street during lunch-time and fire drills. The strongest criticism  of Avis, though, was that he had a so-called weak stand on class 2-405's cheating during free play. When Avis proposed that both classes sit down and agree to end cheating on the field, he lost most of his support. Dicki Ziman had capitalized on this issue and proposed a "" get tough attitude""  on class 2-405. Dicki had argued that the more concessions and compromises made, the hieher the chance of cheating by the other side in the future. The kids in my class seemed excited by this "" get tough"" philosophy. Dicki Ziman attacked Davy Avis on the m ilk issue. Dicki blamed the increases in pints of m ilk on D avy's inep titude (I don't recall Dicki being that clear on the issue). Dicki proposed to lower the price of a pint of m ilk by cutting the amount of money second graders had to bank each week. He had mentioned something about in creased money supplies, but no one understood what he meant. They did, however, like the idea of having to bank less money. Dicki's most effective campaign weapon for class president was his slogan: "" Are you kids better off now than you were last year?""  Most second graders agreed since most of them had failed to get increases in their allowances, due to a thing their parents called inflation. By fa r the most curious kid running for class president was Greg Walker. No one had ever heard of Greg before, since he was a new kid in town. During that one week of campaigning, Greg would always say that he was offering him self as a third choice to the class of 2-405. He said little else that the students could understand. Three days before the election for class president, Greg made a speech calling for a sharp increase in the price of Pensi pinki rubber balls. Second graders became in furiated at the notion that they would have to cut down on the number of rubber balls they bought per month. Many classmates felt that proposing a tax on rubber balls had little to do with leading class 2-405. I still rem em ber election day in our sec ond grade class. Everyone was confused. It seemed that several rumors were cir culating that questioned the basic tenets of the class election. Everyone was saying that a vote for G reg was a vote for Davy and that a vote for Davy was a vote against Dicki. Many kids in class 2-405 were un sure why they should vote at all. Did their vote for their candidate really count? When it came tim e to cast their ballots later that day, almost half of the class put their heads on the desk and went to sleep instead of going to the front of the room to vote. That was 13 years ago and it seems that nothing much has changed. Raymond L.

_,". * a . d i f f a r o n t lrinffc nf things By LYNNE RUTHERFORD The Bison Chips have expanded from their familiar four-man singing ensemble to a member ship of eight, including five new students. Those selected after auditions held last weekend are Mark Greenawald '83, lead; Scott Benedict 84, baritone; Jeff Weitzel '84, baritone; John Comerci '84, bass, and Bill De Turk '83, bass. They will join Scott Thistle '82, tenor; Howard Hillman '84, lead, and Christopher Brown '81, bass Richard Pisano '82 is abroad this semester but will rejoin the Chips next year. The new members were chosen from l5 ap- plicants. Thistle said they were searching for not necessarily the best quality voices, but ones that blend well in the group."" In increasing their membership, the Bison Chips hope to expand their repertoire of old barbershop quartet favorites into more contemporary and challenging music, Thistle said. *'We're trying to get into different kinds of things, and the more modern music requires a little bigger "" We'll keep some of the old barbershop songs, but we want more variety,"" added Brown. The group began with eight members nine years ago but was reduced to four in 1978 because of lack "" Now we are asking for a higher level of commit ment to the group,""  said Brown. All members of the Bison Chips said this was to be a building semester for them. They will not perform as often as in the past, but instead will take time to consolidate their new "" big"" sound. "" Expanding ourselves is part of a ' deg ^ ran8 goal. Eventually, we'd like to be up to par with other similar college groups,"" Hillman said. Dartmouth College and Yale Umversity. among other schools, have a long tradition of four and eight marT singing groups, and the Bison Chqis hope to establish a similar history here, they said. By PAM RUSSO Every Wednesday night, Vaughan Literature Auditorium is filled to its 430 seat capacity by students to view films selected by the Wednesday Night Film Series Committee. The selection process for the films shown each semester begins in March. By looking through catalogues and listening to suggestions, the committee comes up with a list of approx imately 100 films, which is filtered down to survey size, with each member of the committee selecting those he thinks will be the most popular. This survey is then distributed through campus mail to all students. The five films with the highest number of votes -  and within the committee's price range -- are the first chosen. The rest are selected on the basis of what types of films have been most popular the previous year. Prices of films vary from $300 to $500. This week's film, ""The Goodbye Girl,""  was one of the more expensive, costing slightly more than $500. The admission price of $1 is used to cover the cost of films. The committee usually ends up breaking even on each film. "" Some films make a little money, and some lose. We generally make expenses plus a little more,"" Rob Cottington 82, chairman of the committee, said. The committee's choices are limited not only by price, but also by a poor sound system and in adequate projectors. WNFS tries to choose only American made films, leaving foreign films to the Hilltop Series. They have found "" oldies"" like "" African Queen"" and "" Singing in the Rain,""  as well as Woody Allen films, to be among the most popular. The purpose of the Wednesday night film series remains to pro vide an entertaining alternative to students beyond books or fraternity parties. "" We want people to leave smil ing and feeling good,"" Betsy Duane '82, another WNFS member, said. The committee is now in the process of selecting new members. Those now on the com mittee -- which include Cot tington and Duane -- must relin quish their positions at the end of their junior year. Three new ap plicants will be chosen before that time to increase the membership to five, where it was a year ago before members graduated or lost interest. Cottington and Duane are now reviewing the qualifications of prospective members from the freshman and sophomore classes. Students are selected primarily on the basis of their ex perience with film. "" We look for people who both show an interest in film and film- making and for those who are willing to show a commitment. Lack of experience does not necessarily exclude someone from a position,"" Duane said."

The meet was an important one for the women, as two more Bisons qualified for the EAIAW Championships in Boston March 7-8. Freshman Nancy Nelson qua lified for the Easterns with a se cond place time of 11:56.4 in the two mUe run. Junior Co-captam Suzanne Hecker also qualified with a 61.8 in the 440 yd. dash, good for a second place finish. Hecker had already qualified for the one mUe relay team with teammates Linda Accettura 82, Nancy Russo '84 and Laurie Van- Wyck '83. With Russo leading the way, the Bisons won eight of 11 in dividual events against a tough Army team, whose only loss in eight previous meets had been to the University of Pennsylvania. Russo set a school record in the 220-yard dash (27.46 secs.) and tied the record in the 60-yard dash (7.5), as weU as posting a win in the long jump with a distance of 4.95 meters. Lonnie Fertik '83 had wins in the high jump (5'4"" ) and the 60- meter hurdles (9.6), as weU as a second place finish in the shot put (10.34m.) behind winner Beth Bit- tel '83 who had an 11.75m. heave. Accettura took the 800-meter run in 2:23.4, whUe the two-mUe run went to freshman Stacy Nicholson with a time of 11:43.9. The only individual races the women dropped were the three- mile run, the 440-yard dash, and the one-nule run. Army swept all three relays: the 880-yd. relay, the one-mile relay, and the two- mUe relay Before the Eastern Champion ships the Bisons will host the Bucknell Invitational Saturday and then compete against Lock Haven and Mount St. Mary's here on Feb. 28."

The greatest drop in time, however, came from sophomore Dave White in the second heat of the mile. Plagued by a nag ging hip injury in the fall, White kicked to a sparkling 4:24 clocking and bettered his previous best time by more than 10 seconds B ucknell' s fine freshm an class represented most of the team's entries in the two-mile run. Freshmen standouts Bill Reifsnyder (9:00.8) and Jerry Jurick (9:04.0) took second and third in that race while classmate Mike Deckert's 9:16.1 ef fort was his best by six seconds. The final distance race of the meet, the three-mile run, proved to be yet another bright spot for the Bisons. Sophomore Glenn Glibney, who has been running con sistently well for Head Coach Art Gulden, ran another superb race. His time of 14:01.9 qualified him for the IC4A cham pionships in March. The 24-lap race also marked the return of senior distance ace Jim O'Shea to competition. O'Shea, who has not competed since November because of a stress fracture, placed fourth with a respectable 14:21. The marks of the Bucknell track and field team, which started off well and then fell off a bit, appear to be on the upswing. This could not please Gulden more. Ac cord in g to the 10-year m entor, "" Everything we've done since September is geared toward the conference meet on Saturday. The meet is going to be a lot tougher this year than it has been in the past. If our people continue to improve and compete the way they're capable of com peting we'U win it for the third straight year."" The ECC meet is scheduled for February 27 at Lehigh. The women's swimming team closed its home schedule this week with impressive wins over Gettysburg, 83-53, and Army, 97- 41, to push their record to 11-2. Highlighting the women's rout over Army Saturday were sophomore Karen Young's wins in both the 50- and 100-yard backstrokes and junior Martha Parker's victories in the one- and three-meter diving competitions. Freshman Lisa Desrochers tied for first in the 100-yard freestyle with Amy Stifel '84 who also won the 100-yard individual m edley. Tri-Captain Kathy Frazier '82 qualified for yet another event in the AIWA Divi sion IV finals March 14-15 by posting a 2:13.97 win in the 200- yard butterfly. BuckneU took both medley and freestyle relays while All- American Bitzer Dexter '82 and Nancy McGrath '83, having already qualified for the National Championships, won the 50 and 100-yard breaststrokes, respec tively.

3,"By JEANNE MIN AHAN The women's basketball team is beginning to acquire a taste for victory, with two sparkling wins in its last three games. The cagers fought to a 49-29 halftime lead over the visiting Bloomsburg Huskies Tuesday and then cruised to a 79-61 win, up ping their record to 5-12 with two games remaining. The roller coaster season is "" definitely ending on a high note,""  according to coach Terrie Grieb. The Bloomsburg game proved this with an as tounding 80 percent accuracy from the foul line on 25 out of 31 free throw shots. Co-captain Jill Henry '81 highlighted the effort with 28 points and 17 rebounds and co-captain Liz Rabenold '81 added 11 points to the win. The victory over the Huskies was a needed boost after the women I lost 80-65 to a tall and aggressive University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown squad Saturday at home. Johnstown is third-ranked in | the NCAA Division III. In addition to controlling the boards, Johnstown s Sue Shimkus sank 14 buckets, while teammate Carol Mum tallied 23 points. Henry and sophomore Denise Cohen contributed 20 points each for the Bisons and Jenny Burke '83 added seven. Henry broke the University record for points scored in a season last week with 234, [ eclipsing Rabenold's 1980 mark of 199. Cohen, with 189 points this season, also has a shot at passing the old figure. In addition, Henry broke the single season University field goal record with 94 baskets while Cohen has 86, one under the old record of 87 set by Karen Wegener '79. Rabenold needs 16 points to bring her career point total past the record of 595 set by Bobbie Castens '79. By MIKE DeBRAGGIO With only a week remaining before the important East Coast Conference cham pionship meet, the Bucknell trackmen have nearly completed their preparation to defend the conference title. In an open meet Saturday in the Sports/Recreation Complex, the efforts of the Orange and Blue were marked by a number of individual best performances both in the field and on the track. In the field events, sophomore pole vaulter Jamie Dodd was clearly the outstanding performer. After struggling much of the season to clear 14 feet, he vaulted a personal best 14 feet 7.5 inches to place second and establish a new Bucknell record. The old mark of 14 feet 6 inches was set in 1977 by current Bison field coach Mike Baker. Ted Lewis, a sophomore who has already cleared 6 feet 10 inches in the high jump, regained some of his early season form with a 6 feet 8.6 inches winning effort in his specialty. He was pressed by up-and- coming freshman Bill Miller who topped the 6 feet 6 inches mark for the second meet in a row -- this time by a %-inch. Lewis also managed a second in thetriple jump with a distance of 45 feet % inches. The 35-lb. weight throw went to junior Jim Passannante (37'-4"" ) with classmate Dave Beltramello recording his personal best for second. In the other weight event, junior shot putters Gary Bartlett and Mike Ward continued their struggle back to form. Bartlett tossed the sphere 46 feet 11.5 inches for second while Ward's 46 feet 6.5 inch effort placed him third. Bison competitors also performed well on the track. Junior Martin Carter con tinued his season-long dominance of the 60- yd. sprint with a mediocre 6.4 clocking, while classmate Rocky Thompson was out- leaned for first in the hurdles. Three of the four middle distance events went to Bison freshmen. Tony Balestrieri copped the quarter mile in 52.0, Mike Geraghty ran a superb 1:12.9 in the 600 and Jeff Hines' 2:17.4 proved to be good enough to win the 1,000. The Bucknell orange and blue was also very visible in the distance events. A standout all season, junior Steve Bigotto led a Bucknell sweep in the mile run. Bigotto hit the half at 2:02.5 and held on for a personal best 4:11.9. His time bested the See INDOOR TRACK, page 18. Photo--Matt Karanian"

Freshman Meg Giansello (right) passes to a teammate in,
the Bisons 79-61 romp over Bloomsburg Tuesday.,"By JEFF CROSS It was the classic David versus Goliath struggle. The Bucknell Ice Hockey Club--a coachless, sophomore dominated team with enough raw talent to run up a 9-3-1 record - faced the unbeaten Sunbury Suns, the perennial champions of the Susquehanna Valley Hockey League and conquerors of Bucknell in three previous en counters, Monday in Sunbury. Unlike its earlier 5-4 and 8-6 losses to the Suns, when the Nukes waited until the final period to ripple the Sunbury net, Bucknell started fast. Indeed, from the opening faceoff, the out come was never in doubt as the Nukes harassed the Sunbury defensemen and backchecked diligently throughout to emerge with an 8-5 victory. The win, coupled with an 8-6 triumph over Susquehanna Saturday, upped the Nukes' record to 10-3-1. Against Sunbury, Stalio Boyd '80 broke the ice only 4:51 into the game with a backhand shot on assists from Fid Speer '80 and Jeff Cross '82. At the 12:37 mark, Bill Lightfoot '82 banged home freshman Stu Vaeth's centering pass and three minutes later, Remi Johnson '83 scored on a slapshot from the left side with an assist to Hugh Thornhill '81. The period ended with Bucknell holding a 15-7 shots on goal ad vantage to go with their 3-0 lead. However, the Suns were too talented to be counted out, and a shorthanded Sunbury score followed by a pair of Suns goals nine seconds apart left the con test tied midway through the se cond stanza. Bucknell's intensity never diminished, though, and-- inspired by a boisterous crowd-- the skaters retook the territorial advantage. Dan Fitzpatrick '83, who forechecked fiercely all night, gave Bucknell the lead at 9:16 on assists to JoHnson and Jeff Kaighn '83. Three minutes later, Ron Reynier '82 scored on a scramble in front of Sunbury's cage and then Paul Devlin '83 blasted in a slapshot from the blue line on a pass from Kaighn for a 6-3 Nuke advantage. The Nukes, a man down for five minutes, surrendered a Sunbury power play goal at 17:21, but regained their three goal lead 40 seconds later when Johnson scored his second, assisted by Kaighn, to close the period.

Although the minutes report this corruption and waste, the allegations are fictitious, ac cording to ABS Secretary Lon Castle '83. , . . Castle said he included the barbs about government waste and Dunlop's kickback to spice up the minutes and to make the members of the ABS want to read the minutes each week. The minutes for the past two weeks have been strewn with sim ilar jokes designed, ac cording to Castle, "" just to catch their eyes,""  and to "" keep the at tention""  of Congressmen He said the minutes are factual in every other respect, and that he "" wouldn't think""  that his humorous interjections -- one of which described the condition of ABS President Michael Suarez '82 as "" deranged""  -- would hurt the credibility of the congress. Suarez said he thought the minutes were "" crazy""  and'J'a ,^tT tie bit juvenile,""  but said at least the congress is reading them.""  He said the minutes "" m ake good reading"" and although they could hurt the credibility of the congress, it is a "" risk worth taking."" Another joke in the minutes sug gested that Suarez had purchased a Corvette with ABS funds. Suarez denied this, and explained that the congress is just "" putting out some crazy stuff."" Dunlop also denied receiving any funds. "" I've never received a kickback or anything from anyone.""  He said Castle is ' doing a lot of hacking around""  with the reports of the meetings, but he did not "" want to criticize him or praise him"" for it. The minutes, labeled with the epithet "" All the news we choose to print,""  are intended only for the congress, Suarez said, and on ly 50 copies are printed each w 00k He said the ABS plans to con tinue producing "" funny""  minutes each week, and to also issue a supplementary "" straight and serious""  edition of minutes each "" Roberts Dorm Representative Tricia Kennedy '84 said, however, that she has been posting each meeting s minutes hi the foyer of the dormitory for everyone to read. She said he hoped more students would read them now that they are "" funny."

Governor's proposal irks,
local state store employees,"By TRICIA KENNEDY Pennsylvania Gov. Dick Thornburgh's proposal to abolish the state's retail liquor store system and convert it to a private enterprise has caused concern among local employees of the government - owned state stores. An employee of the Liquor Control Board at Danville, who asked not to be identified, disagrees with several items in Thornburgh's proposal, which includes removing all restrictions on the advertis ing and marketing of liquor. The employee said that since privately owned stores will still be required to draw their supplies from the same government warehouses as did the state stores, customers will not have a better selection of liquor. In addition, the loss of revenue to the state will probably result in taxes on other consumer goods such as clothing and food, the employee said. Richard Neff, a clerk in the Lewisburg State Store at 326 Market Street, said that should the governor's proposal go into ef fect, present government-owned liquor store managers "" won't have a chance."" Thornburgh's plan "" will take my job away,""  Neff said. "" I only earn $15 thou sand a year. If I wanted to set up my own liquor store, where would I get enough money to pay for inventory equal to what the state carries now?"" Vice president for Administration and Finance John Zeller said the approval of the legislation will not affect the Universi ty in any way. In a Jan. 28 press release, the governor said under his proposed plan, the state would gradually divest itself entirely of the present 725-outlet retail system. This ac tion would open the retail market to as many privately owned stores as market conditions, local options and licensing and zoning requirements will permit. Thornburgh said his proposal is the result of a long history of corruption and mismanagement in the existing system as operated by the Liquor Control Board, which was established in 1933. According to Thornburgh, privately owned liquor stores will provide better customer service by offering "" greater variety, better prices, and more conve nient hours and locations."" "" Monopolies -- especially government - operated monopolies -- are not inclined to be responsive""  to the "" legitimate com plaints of the customer,""  Thornburgh said. The state would "" continue to operate an expanded wholesale liquor distribution system"" under a "" reconstituted and Photo--Matt Karanian"

Salant prefers CBS post to new position at NBC,
FRANK STANTON,"By MATT KARANIAN Former CBS News President Richard Salant said Thursday night that his current position as Vice Chairman of the Board of NBC is "" not nearly as interesting"" as his previous position with CBS. Salant spoke with former President and Vice Chairman of the Board of CBS Frank Stanton before a crowd of nearly 200 persons in the University Center Forum. He explained after the lecture that he has "" no influence with news at NBC"" because he is "" top brass now."" He said he would "" love"" to get more involved with the news operations, however. Salant was President of CBS News for 16 years before he took his current senior management position with NBC in May 1979. After an introduction by Dean of Arts and Sciences Robert Chambers, Salant spoke to the near-capacity crowd for 12 minutes, followed by a 20-minute discourse by Stanton explaining his early career years. Stanton said he "" tried to get as much of a liberal education"" as he could, and that he believed his example characterized that "" if you're motivated and take advantage of the opportunities around you"" you can be successful. Salant's and Stanton's presentations were followed by a 40- minute question and answer period during which Stanton explained that -- because television is a mass medium -- it must try "" to please as many people"" as it can "" in the time it has.""  He said viewers should therefore "" be selective in what you watch"" on television, "" just as you wouldn't go to the bookstore and read every book."" Salant responded to a question of conflicts of interest within news programming to say that this is an "" enduring myth."" He said direct conflicts between advertisers and news staffers "" simply never occur."" Salant and Stanton spoke as part of this year's Class of '53 Lec tureship. The program is called "" Messages from the Medium"" and included an "" open classroom"" in the forum from 10 a.m. to noon to day^ _________________________________________________"
Record number rush this year;,
253 women pledge sororities,"By LISA CERUTI Sorority rush ended Saturday morning when 253 pledges were ribboned at Hunt Hall. The 344 women who registered for the three-week rush period is the largest number of students ever to participate in sorority rush. A total of 73 percent of the women who registered for rush were pledged. The number of students who accepted bids included 217 freshmen and 36 up perclassmen. The number of pledges represents 67 percent of freshman women and 72 percent of those who were eligible to rush. This year, six sororities took the pre-determined quota of 33 pledges, three took less than quota and one -- Zeta Phi Beta -- dropped out of formal rush before pledging occurred. According to Assistant in Residential Life and Panhell advisor Maureen Chemsak, the revised quota system used this year helped to distribute the pledges more evenly than last year. Last year, quota was determined by taking the number of girls who accepted invitations to Coke Dates, the third party of formal rush, and dividing by ten, the number of sororities participating in rush. The quota system was modified this year to pro vide a "" more realistic"" quota. The figure was changed to the number of women rushing after In vitational Open Suites -- the fourth party -- divided by ten. Chemsak said deriving the quota from attendance at a later party reduced the number. "" The purpose A list of the University's sororities and the women who pledged them this weekend. -- page 5 of the quota system is to ideally provide a place for 100 percent of the girls who register for rush. Since the distribution of pledges is not equal, all women do not receive bids but there are places for all who registered,"" she said. Other reforms in the rush system included the limit Panhell imposed on each sorority concerning the number of girls who could be invited to Theme Parties and Preferentials. In previous years, Panhell recommended that sororities invite roughly two and one-half times quota to Themes and three and one-half times quota to Preferentials. This month, the "" recommenda tions"" were enforced by Panhell so that most sororities had to make cuts at these times. "" Last year some groups suffered because they didn't cut at the right time. The recommended cuts forced people to make decisions earlier and then allowed them to make other choices,"" Chemsak said. Sororities which did not take quota may conduct "" open bidding,""  which lasts through September. Groups may accept pledges until they reach quota or membership of 65, whichever comes first. Panhellenic Rush Council Chairman Kim Cooke '81 said, "" rush ran very smoothly this year. There were only a small percentage of girls who didn't receive bids after prefs and more sororities took quota than did last year."" Photo--Betsy Bagwill"

Consultant to InterVarsity Christian Fellowship Becky Pippert,
addresses a group in the Univesity Center Forum on the prob,
lem of communicating spiritually in the 1980s Wednesday,
night.,
Christian Fellowship leader speaks,
with students in University Center,"By JAN BALAKIAN The problem of communicating spiritually in the 1980s was addressed by Evangelism consultant to InterVarsity Christian Fellowship Becky Pippert in the University Center Forum Wednesday evening. Author of Pizza Parlor Evangelism and Out of the Salt Shaker: Evangelism as a Way of Life, and an article entitled "" Discovery of Spirituality in Higher Education,""  Pippert said "" to understand what it is to be human, we must discover the spiritual part of ourselves. This dimension sets us free, and makes us whole.""  She argued that although during the 70s, Americans sought a spiritually deeper life through developing relationships, many went in the wrong direction by joining cults. Pippert attributed the fact that many Americans are misled to the poor way in which spirituality is communicated. She explained the need to express spirituality in a sensitive, clear and nonaggressive manner. "" We are confused about how to integrate spirituality into our humanity,""  Pippert said. Reflecting the lives in the Gospels, one must love when he is not loved in return and praise those who persecute him. "" Living as Christ lived in the scrip tures demands sacrifices, yet it allows for honesty and leads to health in the long run,"" she said. Pippert concluded that Jesus is what makes us human and is the source of our survival. In order to actualize one's true belief in Christ, an individual must identify with the world while being radically different from it and sacrificing for others, she said. Pippert also conducted evangelism seminars on the subject of Christian witnessing in the University Center Comer Room Thursday morning. This topic dealt with the problem for Christians in describing their faith to others. Thursday evening she spoke at the weekly meeting of the Bucknell Christian Fellowship, which sponsored her visit. Pippert received both her Bachelor's and Master's degrees from the University of Illinois in English Literature. Her husband, Wess Pippert, is cor respondent to the White House for United Press In ternational and has written a book entitled The Spiritual Journey of Jimmy Carter."
ABS institutes task force system to inform congress,"By SUSAN MACDONALD In an effort to actively investigate various concerns within the University community, the Association of Bucknell Students instituted a task force system at its meeting on Monday. The collection of 20 two-person teams will provide the ABS with current, accurate information for dealing with the administration, faculty and students, ABS President Michael Suarez '82 said. The first task force reported on the ABS-sponsored scholarship, currently paid for through the student ac tivities fee. The report, presented by Dan Huck '84 and David Tyler '83, was based on an interview with Director of Financial Aid Ronald Laszewski. According to Laszewski, Bucknell's financial aid program is weak in comparison to its frame of reference schools. While approximately 26 percent of Bucknell students receive some aid, the first $1500 must be provided by the student, Huck said. This requirement is waived for athletes, who currently receive 30 percent of the financial aid budget, he said. "" An additional $150,000 would be available if athletes were responsible for this amount, and 50 to 70 more students could be helped,""  Huck said. Tyler said this would limit the athletes by "" requiring them to work in ad dition to the time they spend on sports."" The discussion of the ABS scholarship will be continued next week, when Director of Admissions Richard Skelton and Laszewski will answer questions from the congress. The idea of a publicity campaign to stimulate student in terest in the completion of the third floor of the University Center was also presented. Team topics include the stu dent handbook, reading period and dead week, cur riculum reform, January programs, the arts at Bucknell and career interviews. Teaching awards as an incentive to the faculty, student- run course evaluations, a rape symposium and a week devoted to an understanding of disabled persons are also being explored. Studies on the counseling and the career services, the dispensary, coed freshman dorms, the use of special in terest housing, Christy's Gate and second semester rush will also be conducted. ABS Secretary Lon Castle '83 said the teams were not limited to congress members."

for bomb threat,"From PSYCHOLOGICAL, page 1. The second threat consisted of phone calls made to three Roberts Hall residents at 3:23 a.m. Zeller said the calls were pro bably prompted by the earlier incident and that several students from Trax Hall were identified as the callers, based on the con tent of the conversations. The offenders were referred to the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs "" for counselling,""  according to Zeller, who refused to release their names. He said the nature of the threats was not severe enough to warrant further official action but refused to disclose additional informa tion. The first incident this school year oc curred Oct. 9, when a Phi Gamma Delta fraternity party was interrupted by a phone threat. The caller said the party "" was going to blow up.""  Lewisburg Police arrived minutes after they were called at about 1 a.m. The house was evacuated and searched for explosive devices, but none were found. The University's response in each case has been to treat the calls "" as the real thing,"" evacuate the building, and per form a limited search, according to Associate Director of Residential Life Gerry Commerford. ""Our first respon sibility is the safety of students,"" he said. "" Fortunately, all the calls have been pranks,"" Commerford said. Prompted mainly by the Roberts Hall in cidents, Zeller said that the University's bomb threat policy was extensively reviewed as part of a complete new edition of the official emergency procedures manual, which was distributed this week.

MONKEY BUSINESS,"--Mary- Scott Cebul of the Philadelphia Zoo ond the MonnellChernicol S e "" ^  Certter observes one of the snow monkeys Wednesday at the Psychology Department s labs at Bucknell West. Cebul s specialty is wailing with and writing about tamarin monkeys, a primate only eight inches in length when fully developed Cebul gave a lecture on the tam arin-cn endangered species because of the destruction of them natural habitat in the Brazillian forest-in the University Center Forum Wednesday night. The new policy outlines steps for notify ing officials for evacuation, calling the police and fire departments, and calling ranking University officials. After con sultation at the scene, officials decide what action should be taken, such as a full search or a search of public areas. The policy also states that individuals must remain out o f  the building for a minimum of two hours following evacua tion and the reported hour of detonation, and that they can then reenter at their own risk. Commerford speculated on the causes for each of the incidents. "" The Phi Gamma Delta call could have been made by someone distraught with the fraternity, and the Hunt Hall incident may have been directed at the sorority system, since it oc curred right at the end of sorority rush, he said. Commerford also said the Roberts Hall threat was probably made to relieve pre-exam tension and "" to have a party."" Both Commerford and Zeller stressed the severity of the disruptions to the residents, and that the University would harshly discipline anyone caught. Zeller said there were no leads in any of the incidents other than the second set of calls to Roberts Hall. He also said that more than five years ago the University was able to trace a bomb threat caller who had made repeated calls from his campus extension, resulting^ in the student's prosecution and dismissal. Professor and Head of Psychology Ernest Keen analyzed the recent incidents in a Bucknellian interview, attributing the behavior to "" the common emotions of anger, resentment and jealousy."" "" These are simple motivations that we all experience,"" Keen said. "" The problem is that most of us check our impulses. It's a real puzzle why these people weren't in hibited -- but at least they didn't actually plant a bomb."" Keen offered three possible explanations for this different manifestation of emo tions. "" First, things like this happen in epidemics; one occurrence prompts another, as in race riots and mental hospital suicides,""  he said. "" Secondly, we can't overlook the thrill and power gained by the caller. Most of us know it's a cheap thrill, however."" Keen also said that when traditional channels for venting angry motives are in effective, a person is driven away and satisfies his needs through behavior such as the bomb threats. "" The common reaction is that these threats are committed by deranged psychopaths,"" Keen said. "" However, this is totally false. They are people with the same emotions as the rest of us, who, for some reason, have chosen to express them in this manner."""

Explosive situation,
It's one in the morning on a Saturday and the phone rings. So you,
"turn down your stereo, stumble to the phone and pick up the",
receiver. The person on the other end of the line calmly tells you,
your dormitory will be blown clear to Shamokin within a matter of,
minutes.,
"Should you panic and jump out of the window, or should you just",
laugh and turn the music back up?,
"Well, you shouldn't do either, but we're afraid that with the near",
"epidemic run of bomb scares on campus since September, students",
may begin treating bomb threats as jokes. We are also afraid,
University officials may begin to display a similar nonchalance,
"toward the threats. This, we suppose, is to be expected when the",
"threats become little more than periodical "" bomb drills"" ; it never",
theless cannot be condoned.,
"As recently as Friday, a bomb threat was made to Hunt Hall.",
"Although the building was cleared 10 minutes after the threat, John",
Zeller--assuming the call to be a prank--allowed several people to,
return to their rooms. The building had not yet been declared safe at,
the time.,
Bomb threats are serious business and they should be responded,
"to cautiously. Believe as we may that the callers are crying wolf, we",
must not allow this to interfere with what our common sense would,
"dictate we do. Instead of going back to your party or running scared,",
call Campus Security. And let's hope they and the administration,
will respond with similar concern for student safety by not allowing,
buildings to be occupied until they are proven safe.,
"As for the people issuing the terroristic threats, we can only im",
agine who they are and what queer pleasure they receive when they,
hide behind their phones.,
BS Minutes,
The ABS Minutes usually attempt to summarize events of a con,
"gressional meeting. They are most often serious, compact and",
precise; their function is to inform.,
But when ABS Secretary Lon Castle found his minutes reaching,
"a somewhat disinterested congress, he designed a set of minutes to",
"amuse, excite and surprise. The result is a series of minutes in",
terspersed with a juvenile assemblage of jokes and false allegations.,
"These, Castle hopes, will keep our attention long enough to read the",
straight stuff.,
"Whether "" spot the joke"" makes good reading is--of course--a",
"moot point. What we cannot debate, however, is the very real, very",
critical need to publish ABS minutes which solely summarize and in-,
"fdegriNo doubt Castle's heart was in the right place. Unfortunately,",
his humor was not. If the ABS congress is too bored or too distracted,
"to read the minutes of each meeting thoroughly, then perhaps they",
need to be reminded of the seriousness of their positions.,
"Similarly, the administration of the ABS should not allow an",
assembly of our student government to be invalidated by the inap,
propriate language or loose construction of its minutes. The minutes,
should read like a sincere reflection of ABS activities--not like a,
comic book adventure.,
Cheap shots,
We reluctantly reported two weeks ago that Pennsylvania's,
Gov. Thornburgh would not bet on the passage of any bill to lower,
"the drinking age here from 21 to 18, and that he would not take the",
"political risk of "" going to the mat""  with the legislature on such a bill.",
That's too bad; college students--and we know you have heard this a,
"hundred times before--are adults, and should be treated as such by",
"any government that taxes, drafts, calls elections or sells liquor.",
A government that sells liquor? Sounds strange to those of us,
"from outside this state. Fortunately, it sounds strange to the gover",
"nor as well, and we applaud his proposal to abolish the state-",
controlled stores by converting them into private enterprises.,
Thornburgh couldn't be more correct about monopolies being,
""" not responsive""  to the customer, and nowhere is that more true",
"than at 326 Market Street. Those $15,000 a year salesmen have been",
surly and condescending to us for years. Let's throw them out into,
"the real world, too.",Sue Willis

Media should accentuate the positive,
To the Editor:,
I,
am,
writing,
mainly,
in,
response to the column by Todd,
Buchholz,
in,
last,
Friday's,
Bucknellian. While I consider,
"myself neither Zeus nor a god, I",
do hope my suggestions are,
enlightening for someone.,
While Buchholz spoke casually,
"of ""mobbed fraternity affairs,""",
"the ""boring"" routine and the",
"""fling"" versus ""link"" dilemma,",
his examples were one-sided --,
what about the money Greeks,
raise each year for charity -- and,
his documentation lacking --,
what percentage of contributions,
come from Greek alumni?,
Yet there is a larger issue here,
"than whether or not Buchholz, in",
imposing his own disapproving,
"image of Bucknell on his readers,",
is affecting their self-image.,
"For example, consider the In",
sider's,
Guide,
portrayal,
of,
"Bucknell, an unflattering account",
written by a disgruntled Buck,
nellian. I submit that he was,
"disgruntled, as most are, because",
the media has scrutinized every,
Vandals,
",",
take no boughs,
To the Editor:,
I applaud the Bucknellian for speaking out against the shameful ac,
tivity of student vandalism. And I agree that there should be con,
siderable student input to decisions on what to do with fellow students,
"gone awry. After all, when one Bucknellian commits a crime, we all",
pay for it.,
"But I wonder how effective the University's ""probation"" policy is.",
The idea behind any kind of penalty is to make the offender realize,
that what he did was wrong and that he shouldn't do it again. Will,
preventing a person from zonking his brain cells with beer for a few,
days out of the week tell him that destroying other people's property is,
wrong?,
I don't think so. And I don't understand Gerald Commerford's,
"remark that fraternities must ""obey the rules of proper conduct",
"established by the University in the Student Handbook."" If 20-year-old",
men need a handbook to tell them that destroying a tree or wrecking,
"living accommodations is wrong, then this University is in sad shape.",

Prof clarifies position,
"aspect of our modem life, and we",
have come up consistently im,
perfect.,
Consider the last issue of the,
Bnci(tm)*m<<n. It contains 23 col,
umn inches devoted to fraternity,
"probation and vandalism, while",
but eight column inches are given,
to an alcohol awareness pro,
gram. Yet which subject prom,
ises the greater potential for,
positive,
effects,
on,
student,
behavior?,
"Now, this is not to fault the",
Bucknellian for what society,
"deems ""newsworthy."" Rather, I",
would like to suggest that some,
attention needs to be paid to the,
potential effects of what is,
"printed, filmed, reported and",
written instead of to its inherent,
truth or commercial value.,
"Therefore, I must feel the solu",
tion is not a second semester rush,
or more government spending on,
free activities for independents.,
The solution is for each one of us,
to be a little less critical and a lit,
tle more positive.,
Dave Smith '78,
"February 25,1981",
Bucknellian in brief?,
To the Editor:,
A school newspaper should inform the community of the impor,
"tant issues, reflect the feelings of the various groups which com",
pose the student body and provoke its readers into a higher level of,
understanding.,
The Bucknellian fails on all three counts. The newspaper does not,
"deal with fundamental issues of the institution; socal tensions, the",
"hiring and the salary of professors, admissions policy, investments",
"policy and so on. Thus, the directions which give the University its",
form and content are ignored.,
The Bucknellian does not reflect the real feelings of the entire stu,
dent body .The overall tone of the newspaper iscomplacency.Except,
"for the ghosts of Alan Levine, Bucky Bison and pre-rape, there are",
"no hints of any conflicts or tensions in the community. But blacks,",
"many of the foreign students, many students interested in art,",
many students committed to learning -- the people who are suppos,
ed to give the school talent and diversity -- despise Bucknell. Yet,
their frustration and alienation are never discussed in'the school,
newspaper.,
"As opposed to enlightening and interesting its readership, the",
Bucknellian stifles its readership. The Bucknellian is as exciting as,
"a mortician's speech. We are inundated with trivia, which deadens",
"the readers, reinforcing complacency. Popular or esoteric curses,",
even discussions of sex -- the kinds of language and the kinds of,
issues which became part of the official culture fifteen years ago --,
are forbidden from the Bucknellian.,
"I am not advocating juvenile exhibitionism or teenage rebellion, I",
am advocating an attempt to understand what is going on in the,
"community, in the country, and in the world. The Bucknellian is the",
voice of the students of a university. Today the voice is of Mickey,
Mouse.,
"The problem lies in the structure of the Bucknellian, the attitudes",
and unwritten rules of conduct which give the paper its character.,
Why is the Bucknellian so complacent? Why is our freedom of,
speech so limited?,

Student study alleviates congestion,
To the Editor:,
I would like to correct an er,
roneous impression left by the ar,
ticle on the tuition increase that,
appeared in last week's Buck,
"nellian. When I was asked, at the",
completion of the meeting of the,
"Executive Committee, whether I",
was satisfied with the faculty,
"raise, I said, ""No, not entirely."" I",
said nothing about not being im,
pressed with the board's efforts.,
"On the contrary, I was then and",
am now quite impressed with the,
board's concern and diligence in,
working on this issue.,
"Stephen Becker, Chairman",
planning and Budget Committee,
"February 24, 981",
To the Editor:,
Caf lines got you down?,
"As introduced in the Bucknellian two weeks ago, I",
have been studying the cafeteria's congestion pro,
blem since last semester. I will be helping the direc,
tor of the University Dining Service to develop,
potential solutions and to implement changes to im,
prove the situation. The system now in use is design,
ed to allow students to move freely from counter to,
counter. The problem with the system is that if you,
"allow too many diners into the service area, you",
allow a traffic jam to develop.,
"The plan we have developed is twofold. First, a",
better system for ticket punching will be used which,
"will ensure fast-pass holders a preference. Second,",
the flow of students into the service area will be ad,
justed to avoid overcrowding in the service area.,
Starting today ticket punching will be done in a,
more organized and equitable manner. Only those,
holding fast passes will be allowed through the,
center doors to the uphill and downhill sides of the,
caf. The system is designed to give preference to,
"those holding fast passes, and will ensure that all",
others are treated equitably.,
Starting March 4 we will be adjusting the flow of,
diners into the service area to avoid overcrowding.,
The ticket punchers will slow the inflow so as to,
"keep movement through the ""scramble"" area on",
the verge of being congested; this monitoring will,
ensure that the flow is maximized at all times.,
Dave Christiansen '81,
"February 24,1981",
Justice for all,
voice for frats,
To the Editor:,
The recent restricting measures applied,
to fraternities seem to reflect the,
philosophy of the current Bucknell ad,
ministration. Especially surprising is the,
lack of an unbiased intermediary group in,
the probationary process. Without equal,
"arbitration and precedence, the frater",
nities were totally stifled. An important,
question is raised from these episodes.,
Should the administration be allowed to,
govern the actions of fraternities without,
the advice and inputs of an unbiased,
organization? The Interfraternity Council,
should be given greater authority to act as,
an intermediary in such instances (if not,
some other organization). This is not to,
"justify ""animal house""-like actions of",
fraternities. It is true that fraternities,
should be held responsible and liable for,
"some actions. However, it is only fair to",
grant the fraternities equal representation,
when such instances occur. The ad,
ministration's strong anti-fraternity,
"stance is not just, for it fails to provide",
equal representation.,
In order for fraternities to abide by the,
"rules of the administration, it is only fair",
that the administration abide by the,
democratic principles of justice.,

Curriculum reform capable of setting societal tone,___________ * ____ a _____ 1 -
J,a m n n /1  cY in n lH  n M  h u n flC C  tV lP CPU*
By Phil Andrews,"Columbia University President Michael Sovern has said "" A great university can be likened to a great cathedral -- an enduring and soaring monument to the human spirit. The University differs, however, in that it is never finish ed. It is always being built."" One major building block of Bucknell University, the curriculum, is likely to undergo major alterations in the near future. According to Chairman David Ray, the facul ty will probably pass curricular reform_vnthintwojrear^"
PHILLING IN,"Thus, it would seem most appropriate that students, as well as administrators and faculty, think deeply about what we would have Bucknell students know. Four years ago in Change magazine, Ernest Boyer (later President Carter's Education Commissioner) and Martin Kaplan published a fascinating article entitled, "" Educating For Survival: A Call For a Core Curriculum."" In it, they propose a core curriculum relevant for all. First, Boyer and Kaplan observe that we all share a common heritage. "" Colleges have an obligation to help the human race remember where it has been and how, for better or worse, it got where it is."" They urge that examination of "" sets of events viewed from different vantage points,"" "" human nature"" and the "" convergence of political, economic, and intellectual forces"" be included in a core curriculum. Second, the authors point out that we all confront the challenges of the present. "" General education proposals have been remarkably inattentive to the commonality in the contemporary world."" They add, "" Education, while its purpose must always go beyond work, does not and should not bypass the cen trality of work -  historically, culturally, and personally."" Moreover, "" The time has come to give a new objectivi ty, a new dignity to work of all kinds ; to recognize that col lege graduates, instead of being demeaned by all but the status professions, can in fact lift up a job and give it new meaning."" Third, Boyer and Kaplan emphasize that we are all making the future. "" Education, indeed, has no higher ethical commitment than to provide students with a thorough value-laden preparation for the next century."" Furthermore, "" The study of the future should involve those acts inherent in all scholarship: the search for en during values, the exposure of hidden assumptions, and the confronting of value-laden choices."" Fourth, Boyer and Kaplan argue that we are partisans -- that we all make ethical choices. "" For too long colleges and universities have suggested to students that beliefs are somehow less important than 'the facts.' But regardless of the pretensions of its member disciplines and the magisterial rhetoric of the college catalogue, the university acts out the choices and commitments it has made. "" None of these choices is 'natural.' All are human- made, subject to revision, born of values, inherently con troversial, and rooted in time and place and economy and faith."" t . . Boyer and Kaplan conclude, "" . . .  we have maintained that the movement away from the required classical core and toward do-it-yourself electives has been informed by, and has contributed to, the hypertrophy of individualism. We have proposed instead a new curriculum based on the irreducible commonalities of our existence."" The late Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. used to lament that most people and institutions are thermometers rather than thermostats -- reflecting, rather than setting the tone of the society. Bucknell, through curricular reform, has an opportuni ty to serve as a thermostat for our society. Let us do so."

"Friday, February 27,1981","By BRUCE BOWEN "" Private Benjamin""  has the potential of being a classic com edy movie. Good actors with ade quate performances and a decent story line are both present. That special ingredient necessary for a contemporary classic, though, is missing. The real problem with this movie is not that it lacks humor, for there are some scenes which are quite funny. For some reason, it simply does not hold together as a tight comedy, or even an above average film. Maybe the genre has been simply saturated with too many movies in all forms of humor. The plot centers around the misfortunes of an upper class Jewish misfit named Judy Ben jamin (Goldie Hawn). We see a scene on her second wedding"

Call Collect,"night where her husband dies on the bathroom floor. Before the plot ever really gets a chance to develop, Benjamin has buried two husbands and been coerced into joining "" Today's Army,""  or, as she puts it, "" the one with the condos and sailboats."" Predictably, she encounters the ogre-like drill sergeant and the buxom gorilla-types whose ways she cannot understand and has no desire to ever experience. Again, predictably, her naive charm gets her and her unit into trouble. Eventually, though, after war games and other sorts of military moves, now Pvt. Benjamin is ap pointed to a very prestigious pla toon and innocently causes her drill-sergeant's reassignment. Sexual moves by her com manding officer result in her reassignment, where she falls in love with a communist and even tually drops the Army so that she can marry him. The conclusion of this story, which on review looks to be rather like a soap opera's, somehow does not do Goldie Hawn or anybody else in the movie justice. In the final analysis, we begin with a quiet, nocent, unlucky, naive rich girl and end up with an unlucky, less innocent, less naive rich girl. No character changes are really even worth mentioning. Hawn does do a remarkably good job in portraying Benjamin, especially in her innocent con flicts with the drill sergeant and her other superiors. Eileen Bren nan also, as that sergeant, shows great comedic prowess in the role. Both these actresses -- pro bably deservingly -- have been nominated for Academy Awards for their work. In the final analysis, the pro blem with "" Private Benjamin""  is that it is one of the few movies that this writer has seen which he simply disliked, without being able to easily explain why, especially in light of the film's third nomination, this time for best screenplay. "" Private Benjamin""  does have some quite funny spots, some de cent acting and is definitely worth seeing once. But it is not the kind of movie one will rave about as one of the year's greatest. The film opens tonight at the Campus Theater in Lewisburg with showtimes at 7 and 9:05 p.m."

"Owner Doris Blanford peers out the door of her Five Points Market, home of the cheap hoagie",
Low rent on the Buffalo Road location helps to keep her prices down.,
Five Points hoagie serves challenge,
to all other grinders in the area,"By PAM RUSSO Four blocks north of Market Street, on the cor ner of Buffalo Road and St. Anthony Street, lies Five Points Market, the home of the cheap hoagie. On first inspection, Five Points Market looks like nothing more than an old time mom and pop corner grocery. It is exactly that, with the added appeal of excellent grinders. Owner Doris Blanford cordially greets you as you enter the market. As you peruse the rows of shrives, the limited size of the store enables you to make a quick inventory of the goods. Still, the range of wares is adequate for this store's neighborhood clientele; this place is everything the corner grocery used to be. Every day at noon, a stream of regulars come to claim their lunchtime hoagie. Many of these are such consistent customers that Blanford knows what to make without asking. Mrs. Heatter, who asks you to call her Dorothy, is the only other employee, unless you count the neighbors who lend a hand to keep Five Points open when Blan- ford goes on vacation. Hanging behind the cash register are two signs indicating the selection of twelve cold and three cooked hoagies. The prices are lower than the Lewisburg norm for sandwiches and the quantity is not lacking. A small is easily as filling as one and a half hoagies from the Bison: from $1 for a small regular hoagie to $1.45 for a small roast beef, Five Point's prices are reasonable. Lower price usually means lower quality, but here is an exception. The roast beef, hams, cheeses and rolls are fresh and appetizing. The store owner says that the St. An thony Street location allows for lower rent and therefore lower sub prices. Five Points is open Monday through Friday from 7 a.m. until 9 p.m. and weekends from 10 a.m. until 7 p.m. There is no delivery service, but you can call 524-0304 to place an order. Why not discover this as an alternative to the other eating establishments and fast food places in the area?"

Born m Dublin and educated at the Conservatoire National Supeneur de Muzique in Paris O'Grady is a violinist of the first rank. After winning several major European music awards, she gained the position of soloist with the Irish National Orchestra, the highest honor in ^ country.

ECC basketball race a toss-up,"By KEN QUAAS The thunder of the crowd stopped as suddenly as if it was struck by lightning Wednesday night as a hustling Lehigh basket ball squad squeaked by the Breakin' Bisons in the last four seconds of play, 63-62. The Engineer victory upped Lehigh's East Coast Conference Western Division record to 6-9 while lowering Bucknell's to the same. Lehigh's victory moved them into a second place tie with the Bisons. The Bisons matched 6-6 records with Rider after besting them Saturday and attained a three way tie with the Broncos and Lafayette for the top spot in the division. But Wednesday saw Rider nail West Chester, 82-65, and left them in a first place lock with Lafayette -- which barely toppled cellar-dwelling Delaware by a score of 65-64. Saturday's contests will tell which teams will gain the final top positions in the heated Western Division. Rider faces Lehigh at Stabler Arena in Bethlehem while the Bisons square off against Lafayette for the third time this season and the first at home. The Bisons were blown out of Charlottesville in their first meeting with the Leopards this year in the Virginia Tipoff Classic, 69-47, but that was black in the faltering early month of November. The cagers sport an impressive 5-3 record for February, however, while scor ing a 56-53 drubbing of Lafayette in Easton and two victories over first place Rider. If both Bucknell and Lehigh win Saturday, there will be a four-way tie in the division for first, as all of the top four teams will have 7-9 records. The divi sion playoffs will begin this week and a loss Saturday would make things even stickier for the Bisons as they would have to play again Monday night. A win would mean a bye until Wednesday. ""Coach Woollum and I will be rooting for each other on Satur day,"" said Lehigh's Coach Brian Hill, who would offer no predic tions as to the outcome of the twisted divisional mess -- or which two teams would face the seemingly indomitable Eastern Division leaders in the ECC Championships at the Palestra in Philadelphia, March 6-7."
A,Lehigh victory would excuse the Engineers from play until Wednesday as well. The powerful East Division has American sitting comfortably on top with a 10-0 conference record after turning back talented St. Joseph's 84-83 in overtime Tues day.

I ',
I,"By STEVEN MEDOFF "" It is the biggest meet of the season"" according to Men's Swimming Team Captain Pat Mitchell '81 speaking of this weekend's East Coast Con ference championship meet at LaSalle. The swimmers got off to a sur prisingly slow start, ending the first day of competition in fifth place. LaSalle streaked to an ear ly lead with 158 points, followed by Lehigh (92), Drexel and Tem ple. . The 400-yard medley relay team of seniors Chris Layton, Mark Gensheimer and Marc Corl and sophomore Dave Wakely were expected to win but were edged by both LaSalle and Tem ple. Anchor man Corl was touch ed out in the freestyle leg, pulling in with a 3:31.842 clocking. The 500-yard freestyle was another disappointment as no Bisons qualified for the final as was expected. Mitchell and sophomores Tim Jenkins and Dave Gassert swept the consola tion final by finishing seventh through ninth, respectively . LaSalle increased their ad vantage by outscoring Bucknell 33-4 in the 200-yard individual medley. Corl recorded his personal best in the 50 freestyle by finishing se cond in the preliminaries in 21.254. A poorly executed turn caused Corl to finish fourth in the finals with a 21.748 mark.

The meet continues this even ing with six finals and concludes tomorrow with the final seven events. Capping their regular season with Saturday's 80-33 romp over Lehigh, the Bisons glided into the ECC finals with an 8-3 dual meet record, Bucknell's best since the '74-'75,9-1 season. Bucknell had won the ECC championship nine straight years until losing the title to LaSalle by 228 points last season. "" Bringing it back home is what it's all about,""  Mitchell said.

Russell also said that other teams may knock Bison and Explorer swim mers out of high scoring positions with strong showings in the preliminaries. "" Our biggest strength is our depth""  which will give the Bisons the edge over LaSalle in the ECC's, according to Mitchell.

Lehigh tops Bisons on last-second shot,
First place showdown Saturday,"By JEFF CROSS In a span of seven seconds, the mood of the near-capacity crowd in Davis Gym for Wednesday's basketball clash between the Breakin' Bisons and Lehigh turned from jubilant to sour. Senior playmaker Dave Shehadi had given Bucknell a 62-61 lead on an 18-foot jumper with seven seconds left to cap what seemed to be a remarkable late-game surge that would virtually assure the Bisons a bye in the first round of the East Coast Conference playoffs commencing Monday. Indeed, when Shehadi's hustle caused the Engineers to turn over the ball on a full court press with five seconds remaining, the boisterous assemblage shrieked with delight at the prospect of a third straight trip to the Palestra for the ECC finals March 6-7. But Lehigh, with lightning quickness, brought a disbelieving hush over the gym. First, Bucknell lost possession and the op portunity to run out the clock when a Lehigh defender deflected the ensuing in bounds pass off Shehadi's arm and out of bounds. Then, after using their final timeout, Lehigh's Mike Power received a pass at center court, spun and fed high-scorer Kevin Riley racing uncovered toward the basket. Riley pulled up ten feet from the hoop as the final seconds ticked away and banked in a jumper off the glass back- board to set off a wild celebration on the visitors' bench and stun the home crowd just as 0:00 showed on the clock. Lehigh Head Coach Brian Hill said, "" It was a set play designed for three-quarter court inbounds play. We've been practic ing it since the beginning of the year."" Keying the Engineers' victory were a remarkable 70 percent (17-24) shooting ac curacy for the second half and a 28-27 re bounding edge over the Bisons. In Bucknell's 54-44 win over Lehigh Feb. 7 in Bethlehem, the Engineers were outre- bounded by 20 caroms. In addition, Lehigh held Bison team cap tain A1 Leslie -- the squad's leading scorer with a 19.7 points per game average -- scoreless for the final 15 minutes. Using a swarming zone defense, the Engineers limited Leslie to six for 21 shooting and 13 A review of recent ECC action and the current stadings -- page 14. points, 10 of them in the first half. The game remained close in the early going, with the teams trading baskets throughout most of the first half. Bucknell entered the locker room with a 25-24 lead. Lehigh assumed command early in the second half and, using rapid movement and pinpoint passing, took a slim lead. The Engineers assumed the biggest lead of the game, 57-52, when Riley connected on two of his game high 19 points with four minutes left. Two crucial, long range jumpers by Paul Adkins '81 and a layin of a Leslie miss by center Deb Okorodudu '82 tied the game at 58 with two minutes showing. Following a Lehigh free throw, Shehadi canned an 18- footer to give the Bisons a 60-59 lead, their first since the start of the half, with only 50 seconds left to set the stage for the dramatic conclusion. Forward Ray Moss '83 led Bucknell in scoring with 18 points and rebounds with seven while Okorodudu chipped in with 11 points and Shehadi and Mike Page '81 added eight markers apiece. The Bisons shot 47 percent (26-55) from the field and 71 percent (10-14) from the free-throw line. The JV upped its record to 11-3 with a 57-55 overtime victory over its Lehigh counterparts. Mike Ferguson '83, who finished with a game-high 16 points, gave Bucknell the win with a last-second jumper. The hoopsters traveled to Lawrence- ville, N.J. Saturday to face Rider in another important conference battle and emerged with a come-from-behind 65-61 win. After trailing for most of the afternoon, Bucknell took a 55-54 lead with 2:59 left on an Adkins jump shot and then used clutch foul shooting to secure the victory.

Women's Track sets,
eight new records,"^ By S.J. FURMAN Sporting a 4-1 record and qualifying nearly 20 competitors for the East Coast Conference Championships, the women's Indoor Track tpam hosted the Bucknell Open Saturday and posted its most im pressive performance this season. Ten teams participated in the all day event, highlighted by strong representatives from SUNY at Binghamton, Lock Haven, Villanova and Cornell. For Bucknell, the day proved quite rewarding; eight Bucknell records were set while two others were tied. Commenting on Bucknell's showing, Coach Diane Ware was particularly pleased with junior Co-Captain Linda Accettura's record half-mile (2:18.8), freshman Nancy Russo's second place finish in the long jump and junior Suzanne Hecker's third place in the 600-meter run. Russo also established Bucknell records in the 60-yd. and 220-yd. dashes, posting times of 7.4 seconds and 27.4 seconds, respectively. Sophomore Lonnie Fertik turned in an impressive performance in the pentathalon, placing third with a Bucknell high of 3091 points. Finally, the two mile relay team captured a close fourth place finish in a record 20:00.7. Joining the 12 Bisons who have already qualified for the EAIAW Division II Championships Mar. 7-8 at Harvard were Deborah Passmore '84 and Laura Gaydos '83 in the one-mile run, while Accet- tura and Russo became eligible for the 880-yd. run and long jump, respectively. According to Beth Bittel '83, the team is 'excited about the Easterns because close to twenty (opposed to four last year) will be competing in Boston."" "" That shows incredible improvement and potential,""  Furtik commented. The Bisons close their season against Lock Haven at 1 p.m. Saturday in the Sports/Recreation Complex."

This credit would be limited to activities involving some amount of academic discipline that are taught by members of the facul ty, according to the proposal, which will be rewritten by In-"

Credit given for courses in the arts currently included in the cur riculum would not be affected. If the faculty votes to imple ment the plan, each department would have to create courses-- such as "" Orchestra 215""--which would then be added to the University Catalogue and scheduled by students in the same manner as a course in any other discipline. Most of these newly-created courses would then offer one-quarter credit per semester, although half-credit and three-quarter credit courses are also possible, according to the proposal. This proposal has the support of members of the Music, Dance and Art Departments and the theatre and drama faculty, because they say it would offer an incentive to students who would like to participate in such groups and productions but do not because of academic com mitments, the proposal said. Assistant Professor of Physical Education Nora Elze--who teaches dance--said, "" Pm in favor of credit for performing arts-type courses.""

Students are misled to believe there is an advantage for enlistees and that they will receive valuable training while in the military, according to CCCO Director of Pre- Enlistment Counseling Larry Spears. Spears said "" loopholes in the enlistment contract"" put the enlistee at a "" distinct disad vantage, and in fact, offer very few guarantees."" The "" ramifications"" of military enlistment are explained "" implicitly"" to students, ac cording to University Military Science Cap tain Michael Thornburg, however. He said he tells students "" exactly what they're signing up for."" Since "" verbal promises are often made by recruiters,"" however, Spears said "" if the military should not come through with what the recruiter promised, the enlistee has no legal recourse."" Spears also said "" many important sounding job titles, such as combat engineer, turn out to be dull, meaningless jobs with no applica tion to civilian positions."" He said the training is therefore "" often useless after you get out of the military"" since the jobs have no civilian counterpart. The University's Army Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) currently has 50 students enrolled here. More than half of them receive financial aid from the University. Under the ROTC pro gram, after signing a contract with the Army, students not on scholarship receive $2500 in financial aid over a two year period, Thorn burg said. Although students have no obligation to the Army and may discontinue ROTC training at any time during their first two years, sophomores must decide whether or not to sign a contract for the remaining two years. Signing the contract obligates scholarship cadets to four years of active duty and to two years in the Army Reserve. Graduates not on scholarship may serve three years on active duty and the remaining three years in the reserve."
Right to take pictures is,
approved by the faculty,"The Bucknellian has won back the right to photograph the Univer sity's faculty meetings-a right that had been officially denied the newspaper since 1966. After a heated debate at the meeting Monday, a motion by Pro fessor of Spanish Mills Edgerton that will allow the public meetings of the faculty to be photographed at least until the end of the year, was approved by an unrecorded voice vote. ""While I consider myself to be completely unphotogenic,"" Edger ton said, "" I can see absolutely no reason why we should prohibit the Bucknellian from exercising its right to free speech by recording our actions however it sees fit."" A number of the 78 voting faculty members were concerned to discover that their meetings were entirely open--"" anybody can walk in,"" according to Professor of Mathematics and Faculty Chairman David Ray--and still more attempted to limit the photographs by creating an amendment that would have limited photographer's time, ability to move and ability to take flash photographs. The amendment was defeated. Assistant Professor of Physics Stephen Becker, who seconded the Edgerton motion, said "" we should not try and write an old-fashioned insurance policy"" by putting such limits on the cameramen. Bucknellian Editor David Hawkings '82 had asked Ray to request for the rescinding of the 15-year-old prohibition, which was created shortly after the monthly meetings were opened to non-faculty members."

US empathy supported,
by Peace Corps ' Celeste,"By MELISSA BAIR "" National security in the next two decades will demand the ap plication of the kinds of skills that the Peace Corps has been about,'' according to former Peace Corps Director Richard Celeste, who spoke to an audience of 150 Monday night in the University Center Forum. The Peace Corps' 20th anniversary this year has prompted a con templation of its function in the poorest countries of the world, Celeste said. According to Celeste, America no longer lives in a bi-polar world -- one in which the United States and Soviet Union are considered the only major powers -- but is one of the many major powers. If the United States is not "" sensitive to the languages and values that people are shoring up around the world, we will not know much about what is going on,"" he said. It makes a vital difference to this country what road we take,- Celeste said. Peace Corps volunteers must "" learn to listen and listen to learn in order to share in the process of change."" In addition, Celeste said the best "" survival skills"" for the United States are to allow underdeveloped countries to choose their own paths of development. Appointed Peace Corps Director in 1979 by former President Carter, Celeste supervised programs involving nearly 6,000 volunteers in 63 developing countries. He is a Rhodes Scholar and graduate of Yale University, and was also a former ambassador to India and lieutenant governor of Ohio. Following the lecture was a slide show given by Lois and Brian Redmond, two Peace Corps volunteers who worked in the Dominican Republic for five years. The presentation portrayed their experience in the Peace Corps. Celeste also gave a talk to prospective Peace Corps volunteers in Carey House Monday afternoon. His visit and lecture, entitled "" Peace Corps or War Corps?,"" was sponsored by the Bucknell Stu dent Lectureship."
'Brien recommends a committee on budget policy,
University's sexual harassment policy,
released by office of the president,"By STEVE GARFINKEL "" Sexual Harassment Policy and Complaint Pro cedures,"" a policy statement describing the Univer sity's definition of sexual harassment and pro cedure for dealing with it, has been released by the Office of the President. The statement is written in two forms -- one that applies to students and one applying to employees. The documents define sexual harassment as "" the subjugation of a person to inappropriate verbal or physical sexual attraction, the coercion of a person into a sexual relationship, or retaliation for a refusal to comply with sexual demands."" According to Assistant to the Provost and Af firmative Action Officer Judith Becker, who drafted the document, the creation of the policy was sup ported by Title VII of The Civil Rights Act of 1964. Becker said that such policies are encouraged under Title IX of the 1972 Educational Amend ments, which discourages sex discrimination. The documents were written under the guidelines of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and signed by University President dent Dennis O'Brien. The EEOC has "" long recognized sexual harass ment as a violation of Title VII of The Civil Rights Act,"" Becker said. Vice President for Administration and Finance John Zeller said the policy "" came from a review of the University's legal posture"" on this subject. Becker and Zeller both said there are currently no cases of harassment of this type under review at the University. Zeller named legal suits brought against pro fessors by students at other colleges and the movie "" 9 to 5"" as examples of sexual harassment and the need for "" appropriate dean or administrator."" If the complaint cannot be "" resolved,""  a written state ment may be submitted to a Grievance Committee available to the complainant under the University's Affirmative Action plan. The statement will become part of the Universi ty's stated Grievance Procedure. Becker said she views the policy as a precautionary measure and hopes she will not have to use it. Neither Becker nor Zeller is aware of any reaction from students or faculty here concerning the policy. Photo-- Carl Jensen"

o,"ByBILLTHUM The formation of a special subcommittee of the University Board of Trustees on salary and wage policy was recommended by University President Dennis O'Brien at the faculty meeting Monday. Following the six month debate on this year's budget, O'Brien said guidelines are needed to provide both a basis and direction for discussions of wages and salaries in the future. The recommendation, currently in the "" draft"" stage, states, "" In the past, more explicit guidelines were real ly as necessary as they have now become."" Whereas 10 years ago, Bucknell salaries ranked 16th out of the univer sity's 17 frame of reference schools, the position has im- \ proved to 7th in 1979-80, O'Brien said. Since the old policy of "" improvement"" has been achieved, O'Brien said, some new criterion for decisionmaking is necessary. In an interview, O'Brien differentiated between two types of guidelines that could be used. The first choice would be to select a rough position within a relative group to strive for. Lehigh University uses this policy in striving for the upper third ranking of engineering institutions, O'Brien said. Likewise, O'Brien said, Gettysburg College uses the American Association of University Professors' wage and salary index and aims to be at the top of its category. Through the use of a ranking system within a relative group of institutions, a level of flexibility can be main tained allowing for many variables to be accounted for, O'Brien said. The second approach is to take some economic in dicator and generate a set of guidelines from it. Col gate University is one that uses this policy. Basically, it would entail identifying an indicator, such as the Personal Disposable Income or Consumer Price Index and increase tuition, or wages and salaries, by a like amount, O'Brien said. The benefit of using the P.D.I. as an indicator, O'Brien said, is that the family's ability to pay will be taken into consideration. O'Brien said he personally preferred the first method of determining a range of wage and salary levels to strive for. He said he is wary of a formula based on external in dicators because not only might they not reflect the special needs of the institution, but they also might not ac curately predict the ability of families to weather such in creases. While the formation of such a committee is as of yet only a recommendation, O'Brien said it was favorably discussed at the trustees' executive committee meeting Feb. 19. It also has the support of Chairman of the Faculty David Ray and University Committee for Planning and the Budget Chairman Stephen Becker. O'Brien expects Trustees Chairman Charles Baird to appoint a trustee subcommittee before the May meeting of the Board, and the establishment of a University committee on wage and salary guidelines to occur soon. "" Hopefully, this will eliminate much of the 'numerology' which currently exists in budget formula tion,"" O'Brien said. ** e e  t"

$7966 is allocated by the ABS,By SUSAN MacDONALD and
MARY LISA MURGIANO,"The Association of Bucknell Students Appropriations Com mittee has recently allocated 60 percent of the funds requested by 10 student organizations follow ing a series of appeals. Both the Indoor Soccer and Ultimate Frisbee Clubs chal lenged the original cuts made by the committee at its Feb. 17 meeting, ABS Vice President Missy Campbell '82 said. The committee initially denied the funds to the Indoor Soccer Club on the grounds that it is too much like a varsity or junior var sity sport -- which the ABS does not financially support -- ABS treasurer Andy Brody '82 said. The committee was also con cerned that there was no open advertisement for students to participate in the club, Brody said. Team member Sunil Gulati *81 appealed the decision, saying that indoor soccer is not recog nized by the NCAA and thus does not obtain funds for tournaments that other"
NCAA,"sanctioned sports Receive. Gulati also placed an appeal in "" What's Happen ing""  for new student participa tion in compliance with ABS guidelines. For these reasons, the commit tee reconsidered its decision and appropriated $584 for the club. Although the Ultimate Frisbee Club received $1,498 of the $3,534 that it requested, the decision of the committee to disallow ap proximately $2381 -- ear-marked for a trip to Florida for competi tion -- caused the members to ap peal, according to club Treasurer E ric Suber '81. The club presented an amended request to the committee Feb. 24 for a University van, station wagon and money for gas to drive the club to its meets in Florida, Suber said. Although the committee de cided to appropriate $585 for the van, car and gas, the request to the administration for the use of the van and car was denied by Dean of Student Affairs John Dunlop, Brody said. Student organization use of University automobiles follows academic, administrative and athletic organizations in priority, Dunlop said. In addition to the above deci sions, eight other organizations received funds from the commit tee. The Bucknell Bandfront re ceived 75 percent of the $176 of its original request. $325 out of $582 was allotted to the Ski Conference team. The Bucknell Progressive Caucus was granted $1564 out of $2663. The Society of Physics Students received $100 which it had requested."
Lorraine Wallace to speak amid controversy,"Lorraine Perigord Wallace will be here Tuesday for the second installment of the Class of '53 Lec tureship -- one week after the end of the controver sy surrounding her husband Mike Wallace's at tempts to stop "" 60 Minutes""  from doing a story on Haiti. Mrs. Wallace, who has lived for a number of years in Haiti and who still has family and a small business on the island, reportedly was upset after her husband first ran a story on the nation's repressive government in 1972. It was her pressure that apparently led the CBS News correspondent to ask his colleague Morley Safer not to film an update of the story this, year, according to the Associated Press and syndicated columnist Jack Anderson. Safer agreed to drop his idea of a new story after Mr. Wallace explained his wife's concern, but the public disclosure of the whole affair last week prompted "" 60 Minutes"" Executive Producer Don Hewitt Tuesday to order that the story be finished. Organizers of the lectureship here had feared Mrs. Wallace might cancel her appearance because of the incident, but Sarah Salant '81 confirmed Thursday night that all three guests would par ticipate in "" Meet the Spouse"" at 8:30 p.m. Tuesday in the University Center Forum. NBC executive Diane Helaey and Mobil executive Peter Healey are the other slated panelists."

clis,"By TRICIA KENNEDY The University's Equal Employment Op portunity Committee reviewed and evaluated the appointments of 19 women and 24 men to the University's professional staff during the 1979-80 academic year, according to a report issued Friday by Assistant to the Provost and Affirmative Action Officer Judith Becker. The report said 16 non-instructional posi tions were filled by seven women and nine men. There were 27 people hired in instruc tional positions, 12 of them women and one a member of a minority group, the report said. Of the 27 positions, four were provisional or"
appointed by no female qu,""" tenure-track.""  Men were appointed to these positions in the departments of management, economics and mechanical engineering. Women occupy 22 of the 180 tenure-track positions at the University and members of minority groups occupy seven. According to the report, 10 of the 21 temporary positions are held by women. Becker said she was "" pleased"" with the in crease in the number of women hired this year but was "" disappointed"" that there were no female applicants qualified for the available tenure-track positions."
lifieations for tenure,"The function of the Equal Employment Op portunity Commission, according to Vice President for Administration and Finance John Zeller, is "" to keep University offices aware of the need to hire minorities""  and to make certain that "" there is no discrimination in the hiring process."" Minority groups are legally defined as those persons who are of black, American Indian or Spanish origin, Zeller said. Vietnam veterans, the handicapped and women are also traditionally given special consideration by equal opportunity employers, according to Zeller."

Library's security tightened after recent vandalism,"__ _ * i << A _ J J _ AAtini/lAf incf Olll! By NANCY KERVIN Recent incidents of theft and vandalism at the Ellen Clarke Bertrand Library have prompted library administrators to tighten security measures there. According to University Librarian George Jenks, theft and damage to books has always been a problem, but instances of vandalism -- including damage to microfiche, books and the building itself -- increased sharply last semester. Jenks said two wooden boxes valued at $15 each and containing microfiche were stolen from the library. The first box was taken during the weekend of Feb. 20-22 and the second was taken last weekend. Apparently, the thief is more interested in the wooden box than the microfiche, Jenks said. A student found and returned part of the film contained by the first stolen box and Jenks found other bits of damaged microfiche behind Roberts Hall. However, the boxes are still missing and the microfiche from the second stolen box has not been recovered. The replacement cost of the missing microfiche is estimated at $300, according to Jenks. Jenks is "" debating whether or not to use uglier boxes""  in order to deter future thefts. In the meantime, library door- checkers have been asked to be more careful and thorough in searching students' belongings as they leave the library. Jenks declined to speculate as to who the thief might be, but said, "" I hope it's not Bucknell students and an outside source instead."" Vandalism to the exterior of the building has also increased this year, according to Jenks. A front window was broken last weekend, and three others have been broken this school year. Jenks said there was "" a lot of student activity around the area,"" which has prompted library ad ministrators to believe a fraternity may be involved. These suspicions are unconfirm ed. Jenks said, "" Pages are being tom out of books and periodicals and this only hinders other students because replacement of these materials takes a good amount of time and money."" Theft of books and other library materials has influenced library ad ministrators to consider installing a magnetic security device system, he said. According to Vice President for Ad ministration and Finance John Zeller, a magnetic device would be installed in the spine of each book. If the book is not pro perly checked out and demagnetized, an alarm will alert librarian workers. Although a consultant has been called in to explore the cost and time involved in utilizing such a system, no definite plans have been made. "" The problem in incorporating this system is the time and cost it will take to put a magnetic device in each book. In the long run, this system would cost less than paying door-checkers to do the job, but the final decision lies with library ad ministrators,""  Zeller said. #IHfi"

"" As the teaching program becomes more stable, an increas ing number of colleges are turn ing to faculty exchange as a way of trading jobs and finding new challenges,"" according to Associate Professor of English Philip Withim. The exchange of faculty mem bers is "" tentatively"" planned to begin in the 1982-83 academic year.

"" At the moment, we're most concerned with coordinating the exchange of faculty. In the long run, however, we would like to in clude students.

According to Assistant Pro fessor of Sociology Kim Schep pele, the exchange with Carleton was originally intended to further the U niversity's Canadian studies program, but the faculty members "" most excited""  about it were not those involved with Canadian or American studies.

Blockley said the faculty ex change will be "" informal""  since there are no specific guidelines as to which departments will par ticipate and how many professors will be involved. "" Since our schools have different strengths and weaknesses, we would not necessarily want to exchange people in the same depart ments,""  he said. In addition to Blockley, Carleton faculty members Steven Richer of the sociology depart ment, Alistair Tillson of the English department and Donald Smith, chairman of the French department participated in the three-day visit."

By JANET WILLIAMS,"The University's financial aid and admissions program was debated at the Association of Bucknell Students meeting on Monday night. The congress, which is currently reviewing possi ble requirements for recipients of the ABS scholar ship, addressed questions to Director of Admissions Richard Skelton and Director of Financial Aid Ronald Laszewski. Although the question of the ABS scholarship was not answered, the congress heard many details of the admissions and financial aid PrE ^ s k i  said that due to a lower budget toe University's financial aid program is weaker than that of comparable institutions such as University, Colgate University and lege. Financial aid recipients represent 26 percent of Bucknell students compared with 78 to M percent of students who receive aid at the above schools, he ^Laszewski said that in order to offset toe amount of financial aid needed, all aid recipients-wito toe exception of some athletes-are required to par ticipate in the work-study programJ^gszewsfaalso said that in 1980 13 football players were awarded full grants while no non-athletes have ever received a full scholarship. . , . . . Further, 29 percent of the financial aid for toe #ass of '85 has been earmarked for athletes, Laszewski said. Explaining why 71 percent of athletic aid was awarded to males, Laszewski said there are more males than females in intercollegiate sports. However, Laszewski said he would rather spread out toe money available for financial aid to help T o T w L  the discussion of the University's ad mission and financial aid policies, toe congress directed its attention to toe recent controversy con cerning toe ABS minutes.

Artful credits,
The recent move of the University Committee on Instruction in,
support of awarding credit to students who participate in certain,
performing arts groups must be applauded. The thought of bringing,
academics and extra-curricular activities together in concert,
represents the true heart of a liberal arts education.,
Although the granting of credit to special studies in the arts is,
"progressive, if not belated, such a program must not be",
limited to the arts; it should encompass all activities which add to,
the well-rounded development of the individual.,
"While time, energy, thought and caring are necessarily a fun",
damental part of an individual's motivations for participating in the,
"arts, so too are those which lead one to a special involvement in",
"other activities such as student government, the campus news",
media and student social programs.,
A carefully orchestrated involvement in many of these activities,
provides a tangible complement to academic studies and can,
enhance the knowledge and expertise of an individual in a field of in,
terest. To support and promote this vehicle of education is not a con,
cession but an obligation of an academic institution.,
We support the committee's relatively farsighted proposal with,
the hope that it will not be limited to those individuals interested in,
"the arts. An earnest--even if not ""pre-professional""--interest in a",
host of other activities should be recognized for more than just,
"abstract ""credit."" We hope the faculty does just this at their April",
meeting.,
"Reporters, reported",
"Two news stories--one on the front page, the other on the",
fourth--give us pause for reflection for the combined message they,
convey.,
", .",
.,
"The one, on the newly-granted permission for our photographers",
to record forever the debates of the faculty on matters both weighty,
"and trivial, is heartwarming to us would-be journalists. That the pro",
fessors sided with Mills Edgerton's argument that there really isn't,
a valid argument against suppressing freedom of the press here is a,
"good sign; private institution or not, the need for such an informal",
Sunshine Law had too long been overlooked.,
"The other, on the interpersonal relationship between ""60",
"Minutes"" and the Haitian regime, is disheartening. That one of the",
most admired journalists in the country is caught in a trap between,
his family and his career as a public servant is a bad sign; when the,
"catalyst of the whole affair is here Tuesday, we hope she can shed as",
much light on all of us as our professors did Monday.,
Remember: The of times apparent whims of the reporter often,
only reflect the whims of the reported.,
Fiddling around,
Bucknell is often criticized by strangers and knowledgeable,
observers alike for failing to provide sufficient cultural outlets and,
social alternatives to its students. The homogeniety of its Georgian,
architecture sometimes seems to sink into its residents' imagina,
tions as well.,
Yet the University is fortunate enough to have an active alumni,
"arts association, one that is willing to provide the campus with a",
well-stocked week of artistic programs and events. The fifth an,
niversary of the Celebration of the Arts Week is a good time to reex,
"amine the goals of a college education and, most importantly, the",
personality of the average student here.,
MaryAnn LaCroix--student coordinator of the week--held an in,
terest meeting for organizing Celebration '81 and was greeted with,
an empty room. Many Celebrations of the past have suffered a,
similar fate. Big names such as Rampal or Houseman may draw,
"well, but generally speaking the University's arts weeks have been",
as poorly attended as they have been well organized.,
Amidst this inexplicable lack of interest in the arts come ever,
more vociferous complaints of ennui with the fraternity party social,
scene and the rural Lewisburg atmosphere.,
"Why have we come to college in the first place? Presumably, to",
"receive an education, a broadening of horizons--and those of us who",
"ignore an entire week of cultural programs, regardless of being",
"otherwise engaged at either the library or the bar, cannot be",
classified as students.,

LETTERS,
Bucknellian is horse,
of a different color,"TotheEditor: . ,  . . . The Bucknellian has been criticized lately as be ing recalcitrant in performing its duties as an organ of information. One person even went so far as to say that "" the Bucknellian is as exciting as a morti cian's speech.""  This is unjust and not true. The Bucknellian is at least as exciting as the mortician s client, and last week's issue proves it. First, the editorial entitled "" BS Minutes""  was most enlightening. As an ABS member, I'd per sonally like to admonish Lon for trying to be original Lon, don't you understand the importance of those ABS minutes? The Bucknellian's investiga tion of Dean Dunlop's supposed kickback uncovered the gross lie you were perpetrating and saved Dunlop from further embarassment. The future of Bucknell rests on your shoulders Lon; don't let us down. The picture on the front page--of the swimmer receiving a haircut--provided a fine example of the hard preparation the swimmers had undergone in anticipation of the upcoming ECC meet. I felt that perhaps a photo of a track team member clipping his toenails in preparation for his ECC meet would have also been appropriate. Other articles, such as the "" Doonesbury"" comic plucked from the middle of the weekly series,"
OPINIONS,
BS publications jest for laughs,"Prince Charles' plans to be married to Lady Diana and the murder conviction of Jean Harris might lead some uncultured students to exclaim Who cares?""  Well, I for one care, and I'm glad the Bucknellian is responsible enough to provide the in formation. The Bucknellian speaks with the voice of Mickey Mouse? Nonsense. Mister Ed perhaps. Mark Barbour '82 March 4,1981 TotheEditor: We find it humorous that all the Bn^nwiliim reporters can ascer tain to put on the front page of its paper are stories about some one's wit in the ABS minutes. If the ABS is so uncredible for these jokes, the Bucknellian should recall some of its own stories. For instance, last year the Bucknellian reported that McDonald's was opening up on the Third Floor of the University Center. The front page photo graph was hardly credible to McDonalds, and hardly true. And what about the ad concerning Angelo's House of Leather? Nak ed breasts may have been hor ribly offensive to some people (including the House of Pizza). And did you know that 1800 people accepted admission offers last year? The Bucknellain reported all of this. Now we students all knew that the issue was in jest, and we took it as such--even though the Bucknellian could be held liable for its juvenilish reports. Likewise, the ABS understands Secretary Castle's motives, and subsequently, the"
ABS,"ap preciates it. Castle's humor is witty, directed toward people with similar senses of humor, and effective. The Bucknellian should have such humor. Ken Wolckenhauer '82 Rob Costantini '83 March 3,1981"
Was Chambers featured in Class of 53 lecture?,"TotheEditor: We were confused. There is no doubt about it. We went to hear Frank Stanton and Richard Salant speak about corporate responsiblity and ethics, topics they are eminently qualified to speak about. To our surprise, we heard a 15 minute lecture by Dean Chambers, who also must have been confused in thinking that he was to be the featured speaker. A visitor who entered late asked us if he was Stanton or Salant. Following his dissertation, we heard a brief discussion of career paths, with such enviable advice as "" you have to be lucky""  (what course number is that?) or share an office with someone who spells his name Scaravelli. There is no denying that there were some amusing stories told by intelligent men whose careers have taken them to the top of the television world. But the topic they spoke on was neither serious nor informative. Finally, it is disheartening to find that visitors to our school seem to think that the only thing on the minds of students is get ting a job. Perhaps they read the Yale review. It said: "" Bucknell is a school for nice kids from nice families who will do almost anything to land a job with a good company and precious little to do anything else of value."" The idea of the Class of '53 Lec tureship is a valuable one. Let's hope the speakers take it serious ly. GlenTullman'81 Dave Hibbard '81 March 3,1981"
"Finds symptom, offers no cure","TotheEditor: , , Craig Ullman's definition of the role of a school newspaper (Feb. 27) is an accurate one, and one inherent in the act of publishing a newspaper. As a former Bucknellian editor, I take exception to ms pronouncement that the Bucknellian fails in its endeavor tob e Bucknell's student newspaper. I think it reflects the student body that it covers all too well. , .. Ullman complains that there are no hints of ^ ycon fh cts or ten sions in the Bucknell community as reported by B^taelUan, and therefore, the paper "" stifles its readership, is complacent and "" limits our freedom of speech.""

Students support athletes with more than eheers,
By Todd G. Buchholz,"Professional sports at Bucknell? Well, sort of. In justices at Bucknell? Yes. A collision of inflation, higher college ' costs, more intense athletic competition and finan cial aid monies are used to sup port interscholastic athletics. It is a very tangled tale of mis placed priorities. First a few facts about Bucknell's financial aid pro gram. Compared to ""frame of reference"" schools such as Lehigh and Lafayette, it's poor. Until a few years ago financial aid at Bucknell was a part-time concern. Because of this laxity in a time of budget cutbacks, to day's director--Ron Laszewski-- must be exceptionally aggressive in attracting funds just to stay even. Where similar schools give aid to 70-80 p e r c e n t  of students who qualify, Bucknell can only afford to help about 50 percent. Despite the dearth, we ap parently feel wealthy enough to set funds aside in a ""talent grant"" pool specifically for athletes. It works like this. Before Bucknell will give a dime for aid, students must provide the first $1,500 each year. Through sum mer jobs or January work or bor rowing from Grandma this ""self- help"" must be contributed, ex cept for talent grant students. And here's where the sportsmen turn pro. Nearly 100 men and woman athletes are not paying any ""self- help."" While regular financial aid recipients might be working in the game room or in the cafeteria, these talented in dividuals are earning their $1,500 on the football field or on the baseball diamond, thus draining"

Lewisburg,"the financial aid budget of about $150,000. Perhaps ABS Congressman Dan Huck '84 said it best: ""I'm working in the dishroom of the cafeteria with the steam from the dishwasher in my face, and I scrutinized. Formulated and approved by the trustees in 1978, the policy alloting 24 percent of the total financial aid pie to athletes is under review for the May board meeting."
THE BUCH,
STOP,"think--some guy is getting paid to bounce a basketball."" If this policy were changed, Laszewski says he could offer aid to about 150 more students. With a cutback of federal loan programs (about 50 percent of Bucknellians have a student loan), rising tuition costs and therefore more financial aid qualifiers, the budget must be Naturallv anv revision frightens coaches and offends sporting alumni. Many will claim that without the give-aways we won't be able to compete with current athletic adversaries. These questions should be put to them. Does our sports program hinge on 100 people split among men's and women's sports? Are athletes choosing Bucknell only because of that $1,500 grant? Should aiding a few athletes take precedence over helping many other students who qualify for financial aid but receive none? The current economic troubles have harmed everyone. But as Laszewski said, ""The sports pro gram has not borne the brunt pro portionally."" Quoting from the board policy: ""It is expected tbat the level of support will enable the Universi ty to participate in all inter collegiate athletics within the limits of available resources. "" While Lafayette may have funds to help 70-80 percent of needy students and also give special attention to athletes, do ing both is not ""within the limits of available resources"" at Bucknell. We have a choice to make. And so do the trustees in May."
A long and winding road to success,
By Joan Caragher and Kris Forsythe,"Ideally, a college education is designed to aid in the development of a ""whole"" person. In other words, the graduating student should, upon com pleting the requirements for a degree, be social ly acceptable, emotionally stable and mentally prepared. Supposedly, 756 ""whole"" people will be set free into the ""real"" world May 31. Three basic options are available to these new members of the nine-to-five world. First, one can plan to sponge off one's parents until one adjusts to societal pressures. Of course, Bucknellians are much too ambitious to choose this course. Therefore, we will not dwell on its specifics. The second, more popular choice is a job. We're sure you've seen many interviewees around campus recently: they're the ones who force themselves to rise at the ungodly hour of 6 a.m. to sign up for interviews. They are next seen on the day of the big event, arrayed in pin striped suits, conservative ties and wing-tipped shoes for males. Females opt for very basic tweed suits and Papagallo pumps. If impressions are favorable, they are offered a second interview. If unsuc cessful, the prospective careerist starts yet another sign-up session at 6 a.m. The third option is continuing one's education either in medical, law or graduate school. The first stage of the application process begins with standardized tests -- either MCAT, LSAT, GREs or GMATs. Compared to these tests, the SATs seem like an exercise in connect- the-dots. If one has a sadistic streak, one can stroll by Olin Science on a testing day to gawk at the frazzle-brained zombies that stagger out after the grueling ordeal. The real fun begins with filling out applica tions. After spending countless hours and dollars writing why one is more qualified to be a doctor or lawyer than the other 5000 applicants, one may be lucky enough to receive a Dear Applicant form letter. This usually states that ""while we cannot accept you this year, we did enjoy a sumptious seven-course feast, the cost of which was defrayed by your application fee."" The best way to handle a rejection is to set it ablaze. To avoid burning down University hous ing, take the rejection letter, envelope and cancelled check to the sink. Artistically singe the edges to create a scalloped effect. The charred correspondence brightens up not only one's wall, but also one's disposition. If, by the grace of the gods, one is accepted into an institution of higher learning or offered a job, celebration is in order. Books can be tossed aside, while the ecstatic graduate polishes Space Invader skills at the bar. Only then are these col lege years ""the best of our lives.""

David,
Bromberg strikes receptive chord,
ARTS,
Acoustic music mesmerizes audience,"By D.S. JONES Further evidence to support the position that bigger is not necessarily better was provided by David Bromberg and friends Saturday night. No doubt, those who enjoy pay ing $15 for a ticket to sit 3 kilometers from the stage and ab sorb two hours of cacophony would have been duly disap pointed, but for the full house at each of two shows in Coleman Theater, the evening defied superlatives. It has been said in passing that it is often nice -- when attending a concert -- to hear what those on stage are saying, strumming and singing. This aspect of concert going can be an exceedingly dif ficult task when one is seated in an acoustic trash can that some times doubles as a basketball theater. It would be a challenge to find an auditorium that could provide more comfortable and in timate surroundings than Col eman for both performer and per- formee. An added bonus at the Bromberg show was the fact that members of the audience could see and hear every thing that was happening on the stage. In order to have the rare calibre of concert that was produced on Saturday night, however, it is somewhat helpful to have, in ad dition to adequate acoustics, someone worth listening to. David Bromberg is an artist who falls into this category. What makes Bromberg the suc cessful entertainer that the au dience heard goes beyond sheer instrumental virtuosity and into his ability to communicate with those around him. A genuine rap port was established as the Col umbia University drop-out rambled on with stories and jokes that emerged from guitar solos and disappeared into fiddle licks. Bromberg's wit and improvisa- tional skills pervaded an at mosphere which was always loose enough to allow him to climb over a couple of rows of seats and shake hands with someone in the audience. The acoustic guitars and fiddles of Bromberg and his friend Jeff Weiser proved that one need not be electric to be eclectic. Whether playing bluegrass, ballads or the blues -- which ap peared in the form of "" Living in the Country,"" "" Dehlia"" and "" Come to My Kitchen"" Bromberg captured the feeling of each number and shared it with his audience. Whether using slide or picks, Bromberg's guitar play ing mesmerized as his hands seemed to magically float over the instrument. And whether or not an acoustic show in a quality theater with a lively audience listening to a fine musician makes for entertain ment that rivals that found in any city is a question that probably will not be subject of too much debate. From the talented warm up music of Rich Getz and Steve Triesman to Bromberg's closing solo "" Mr. Bojangles,""  a prece dent in size and style was set that gets a call for an encore.

"" We try to bring as much of the arts to the public as possible -- local residents as well as students, Rccs said The association, comprised of 210 parents, alumni and friends of the University, has called the building of a performing arts center its primary g Rees, along with the other 14 members of the com mittee began his search for talent last summer. Trustees, faculty and friends who sit on the commit- tec are divided among the art, music, English ana drama disciplines and try to reflect this division in varying the guests that come to campus. The committee received cooperation from Doth the Performing Series, which scheduled flutist Jean-Pierre Rampal during the celebration, and Cap and Dagger, whose production of "" Our Town will fall at the end the arts week. This year, Cap and Dagger is celebrating its 80th anniversary with an on-stage cast party after the March 14 evening performance. Alumni of the organization from as far back as 1939 and as far away as California are scheduled to attend. In honor of the anniversary, the program commit tee decided on a main speaker in drama.

J.,Pittas who will present a slide show and lecture on

Coordinating the undergraduate portion of the pro gram is Mary Ann LaCroix '81, an interdepartmen tal and French major, who began in early February to secure student performers. "" In the beginning, the schedule was strictly off- campus people. I filled it in with on-campus acts, LaCroix said. LaCroix -- along with Sue Dettbam 81, Cathy Claude '82 and Linda Wolff-either approv ed or were contacted by various'on-campus groups. They tried to distribute activities between different arts mediums, but were not always successful. "" I'm disappointed that there is not much dance, LaCroix said. The Dance Company will present a concert later this semester, but lack of time prevented them from performing this week. Another area that proved disappointing was lack of student input in scheduling the week. "" I announced a meeting for anyone interested in helping plan the celebration but no one showed up. It's not surprising -- typical apathy,"" LaCroix said. Both LaCroix and Rees hope, however, that this apathy does not extend to attendance figures during the week.

Stiglich graces Center Gallery with,
disturbing works of glittery nature,
By DAVID BLACKMAN,"Perhaps one of the most unusual exhibits to appear in the Center Gallery in quite some time is the work of New York area artist Diane Stiglich, presently on display through March 26. At her opening Tuesday night, students' comments ran to: "" wild,"" "" tremendous clash of elements,"" "" wonderfully disturb ing,"" and "" just incredible"" in describing her works. Using various man-made ob jects, art prints and photographs, Stiglich transforms these items with substances such as cotton, feathers, human hair, artificial flowers, tinsel, many personal belongings and primarily glitter to achieve her stunning results. "" I'm not interested in real things or permanency, but in im itating real life and evoking im ages of nature through man made things,"" Stiglich said. The artist achieves these objec tives by creating a keen sense of negative space and three- dimensionality with different col ors and tensions of glitter over mass-produced items of all kinds. Originally from Abington, Pen- na. and now residing in Lake Hiawatha, N.J., the artist spent several months living in Lewisburg and instructed here for two months as a substitute for Assistant Professor of Art Joan Curran. Stiglich received her for mal education from Moore Col lege of Art in Philadelphia and the University of Texas at Dallas. During her stay in the area, the artist was inspired by many items found in the Mifflinburg Thrift Shop. Several of these ob jects are now on display, in the Ellen Clarke Bertrand Library. According to Stiglich, many of her works are autobiographical, based on particular events and people in her life. Among these is a piece which includes three enlarged photographs of her hus band as a child. Presently teaching part-time and devoting eight hours a day to her work, Stiglich is also now displaying her pieces at the corporately-owned 500 Exposi tion Gallery in Dallas and in Philadelphia."
A true classic coming to town,"By LYNNE RUTHERFORD An American film classic, "" Gone With the Wind,"" will open at the Campus Theater in Lewisburg tonight with showtime at 7:30 p. m. Generally considered the most popular movie of all time, David 0. Selznick's Civil War epic has been witnessed by more people than any other film in history since premiering in Atlanta on Dec. 15,1939. A pioneer in many important ways, "" Gone With the Wind"" was filmed in technicolor with the largest budget ($3,900,000) of any movie up to that time. Filming of the 3-hour, 40-minute adaptation of Margaret Mitchell's novel took 22 weeks and proved arduous to its directors. The original choice, George Cukor, was removed after the first few weeks, pur portedly at star Clark Gable's request. He was replaced by Victor Fleming, who shot the greater part of the film before collapsing from exhaustion. Sam Wood and Sidney Franklin directed the final scenes together. Fleming's mastery, though prevalent throughout the film--one of its nine Oscars was for cinematography--is best illustrated in the ballroom and burning of Atlanta scenes. The most celebrated sequence of the film, the pull back shot that begins with a close-up of heroine Scarlett O'Hara and grows to reveal hundreds of dying soldiers at an Atlanta railroad station, is a towering achievement. Legend has it that designer William Cameron Menzies (also an Oscar winner) ordered the entire scene reshot because a horse's tail was braided in correctly. In casting, Producer David O. Selznick issued a nationwide talent search for Scarlett, which caused hundreds of unknown young actresses to flock to California. Stars Joan Crawford, Bette Davis, Claudette Colbert, Katharine Hepburn and Paulette Goddard were all rumored close to the role before Selznick finally settled on unknown Vivien Leigh. Her British background caused an uproar, but she became the first English actress to ever win an Academy Award. Likewise, Hattie MacDaniel became the first black to receive an Oscar in winning Best Sup porting Actress of 1939 for her portrayal of Mammy, the O'Hara's faithful servant. "" Gone With the Wind"" broke the color barrier here. Although still playing servants, black people were treated as ma jor and sympathetic characters for the first time. As Rhett Butler, Gable established one of the most popular screen characters ever and was pro totyped as a glamorous hero for much of the rest of his career. In supporting roles, Olivia deHaviland, as the fragile and noble Melanie, and Leslie Howard, as her weak-kneed husband Ashley, fit their parts to perfection. Put simply, "" Gone With the Wind"" remains oneof the best cast, best filmed pictures of all time, despite the more than 40 years that have passed since its debut. We all owe it to ourselves to spend a few hours sampling Scarlett, Rhett and Tara, along with a very large bucket of popcorn. ----------------------------------------------------------------------"

The comm ittee found that precedent does exist here for the awarding of partial credit. Some course already in the Universi ty's offerings offer other than a single credit courses--Education 207 is worth two while Music 119 is worth one-half, for exam ple-- and the Physical Education Department continues to offer courses worth one-quarter credit. University Registrar Bruce Freed said "" some positive state ment by the faculty might make some students more aware of the (partial credit) options."" After the courses are designed by the faculty of the respective departments, the Curriculum Committee of the College of Arts and Sciences would evaluate each course and assign an amount of credit. Freed said he estim ates that if the faculty approves the pro posal, the new crediting system could probably be instituted for the 1982-83 academ ic year. Although no problem exists with awarding the credit, the holdup would be in the designing of the new courses and their addition to the form al curriculum."

TenBrook shines at 134,By JEFF CROSS
"LAWRENCEVILLE,",
N.J.,"- Lapel buttons sported by Bucknell fans during the East Coast Con ference quarterfinal game against Rider here Wednesday said, "" Lasso the Broncos."" Un fortunately, the once-Breakin' Bisons were hog tied 68-50, abrumptly ending their season at 12-16 while the Broncs (14-13) advanced to the ECC semis against American tonight. The hoopsters advanced to the quarterfinals with a convincing 79-66 triumph over West Chester Mon day but lost to Lafayette 68-60 Saturday in the regular season final, both at Davis Gymnasium. A win over the Leopards would have given Bucknell a bye in Monday's preliminary round of the con ference playoffs. Prior to the tip off against Rider, Head Coach Charlie Woollum said "" taking care of the ball and shooting well"" were keys in beating the Broncs to earn a third straight trip to the Palestra for the ECC tournament this weekend. Bucknell had already beaten Rider 62-55 in overtime at home Feb. 4 and 65-61 Feb. 21 on the road. When Rider's Fred Lee stole senior Captain A1 Leslie's inbounds pass for an uncontested layup in the first half minute of play, the Bisons should have known it was not their night. Although Bucknell stayed even with the Broncs for the first 12 minutes, Bucknell could manage only a pair of two-pointers for the remainder of the slop pily - played first half to trail 34-21. In committing 14 turnovers, the Bisons were whistled down for traveling and charging violations and watched as passes lacking their usual zip were intercepted. "" We threw a few balls away early and that made us not try some plays; it made us apprehensive,"" Woollum said. "" It appeared we were physically and mentally exhausted. When the tempo picked up we were gone."" A driving layup by Paul Adkins '81 closed the gap to 38-28 with 14:43 remaining, but the cagers could get no closer. Eight more turnovers and seven blocked shots hindered the comeback attempt. Woollum noted, "" I don't think we were ready to play. All of us (coaches and players) were to blame for that."" "" I don't think we wanted it enough as a team,"" Craigg Cody '83 added. Seldom-used seniors Joe Vullo, Ted Schoeck and Howard Manly all saw action, joining regulars Leslie, Adkins, Mike Page and Dave Shehadi in their final game in the orange and blue. Woollum said, "" They've been a part of a great four years of basketball at Bucknell. I have the utmost respect for all of them. They're all the kind of people I like as friends and players."" Leslie led the team with 11 points despite four of 15 shooting while Rider's Derrick Miller penetrated the Bucknell defense effectively, scoring a game- high 16 points while Lee added 14. Against West Chester, a slam dunk by Ray Moss '83 with 3:27 left in the game gave the Bisons their biggest lead, 69-51, but the Golden Rams then scored 11 of the next 13 points. The hosts survived the score, however, to secure a big 79-66 playoff win. Page scored a game-high 16 points while Leslie (14 points), Moss (12) and Adkins (10) all scored in double figures. Before a sellout audience Saturday, the Bisons met Lafayette with first place in the ECC West at stake Leslie took charge for Bucknell early, scoring 10 of the team's first 12 points. He tallied 20 for the first half, but the Leopards clung to a 37-35 lead. The Bisons stayed within two points for the first seven minutes of the final half, then gave up seven unanswered points to trail 54-45. Adkins closed the gap to 62-58 with 3:22 left but the Leopards used perfect free throw accuracy in the final minute to preserve a 68-60 win. Leslie finished with 26 points but only hit on three of 10 second half attempts. Okorodudu added 14 markers. __ By KEN QUAAS "" Sharp"" is what Bucknell's wrestlers should have been to capture the team championship in Saturday's East Coast Conference meet, according to Coach Bob Ferraro. The Bisons travelled to Lafayette last weekend on the heels of a sweep of three straight tri-meets and locked with their Easton hosts for second place in the ECCs--one match behind conference leader West Chester. But a bit of bad luck and a sluggish team performance kept Bucknell from pinning its first ECC team title, as the Bisons were bested by West Chester and defending champion Hofstra. "" We just didn't wrestle well as a team, Ferraro said. "" If we can place third in the conference with a sub-par performance, I can't be unhappy. But we weren't as sharp as we were at the previous two meets."" The coach was referring to the last two outings, when the grapplers trounced con ference rivals American, Delaware, Lafayette and Rider. Misfortune tarnished the meet as Steve Greenly '82--150 pound champion in 1979 and runnerup at 158 last year-w as gypped of a possible win in the final became of what Ferraro called an "" error in of ficiating."" _  ,, Greenly tangled with Rider's Dave Doll in the 190-pound final. Doll was called five times on violations--two cautions for false starting and three for stalling, ac cording to Ferraro. Under NCAA rules, Doll should have been disqualified and the match forfeited to Greenly after the fourth violation. But Ferraro said the referee lost count, and failed to disqualify Doll, who squeaked out a 13-12 decision. Ferraro lodged a protest with the ECC Games Committee, which voted 2-1 to let the match stand because the referee had already signed the match card, Ferraro said. "" It's unfortunate that there was a mistake,"" the coach added. "" Neither Dave nor Steve would want to win a match that way.""  Greenly said that he was concen trating on the match and that he only knows what he was told about the error. "" These things happen,""  he said. The bright spot in the meet was the outstanding performance by freshman Jim TenBrook who grappled his way to the 142-pound title. The 1980 New Jersey State High School Champion dropped from his usual 150-pound slot two weeks ago, where he wrestled all but two contests this season. "" Jim is big for a 142-pounder, and that was definitely an advantage,""  Fer raro said. Rich Passerotti '82, who joined the team three months late, was the Bisons' other runnerup. A football player as well, Passerotti had also joined the team late when he nailed the regular season ECC"

Sophmore Wally Zimmerman turned in an impressive performance at 134 pounds--a class he has wrestled but once this year. Zimmerman took an 8-6-1 record into the conference meet and grabbed third place, as did teammate Bill White '84. Senior captain Doug Mays finished fourth at 126 and junior John Stoner also registered a fourth at 167. The Bisons third place finish came with 57 points compared with 62.5 for second place Hofstra and 81.25 for West Chester, which dealt the team a conference loss earlier in the season. Bucknell improved last year's fourth place showing while Hofstra ended a six-year ECGreign."

Women cagers beat Lafayette;,
Henry sets career records,"ByS.J. FURMAN The Women's Basketball team capped its regular season Satur day by posting its first win ever over Lafayette. Bucknell ex hibited an impressive rally in the secon d half to upset the Leopards, (12-5) 63-61. Coming off a two-game winning streak, defeating both Bloomsburg and York, the team boosted its final season record to 7-12. Trailing 38-24 at halftime, the team returned in the second half, hammering away at a 14-point deficit. Led by senior Jill Henry and sophomore Denise Cohen, the team battled back to a 48-48 deadlock. With less than 10 minutes to play, the defense began to pressure coach Pat Fisher's Lafayette team. At 7:03, Jody Travisano, a 5'5"" freshman, was successful in a two-point attempt that put Bucknell ahead for the first time. The pressure defense let up earlier, however, and by the three minute mark the Bisons found themselves trading once again, 58-54. At 1:42, they were down 61-56, though Cohen returned with two quick baskets to cut the Leopards' lead to one. Travisano then created the key play in the match.

Ted Lewis '83, also hampered by injury, still managed a fifth in the high jump and a sixth in the triple jump. The meet did have its bright spots. Freshman Bill Reifsnyder con tinued to shine after a golden rookie season of cross country running. Reifsnyder dashed to a second place time of 9:10.6 in the two-mile. The highlight of the day was the exciting 1000 yard run, where the trio of Hulme, DeBraggio and Bigotto duplicated their earlier feat in the mile, by seemingly coming out of nowhere on the final lap, running wide, and surging past the competition. Bigotto was credited with the win in 2:14.4, while DeBraggio was right behind in 2:14.5, and Hulme followed in 2:14.54. "" It was just one of those magical things--you reach down to see what's there and it was there,""  DeBraggio said. Of the sub-par Bison showing, Debraggio said, "" Temple had an ex cellent day, but had we done anywhere near what we were expected to do, we would have won. That's the most frustrating thing."""

Swimmers bow to LaSalle for 2d,
Late rally fails to,
rescue the poolsters,"By STEVEN MEDOFF A second and third-day rally by the Men's Swimming team Friday and Saturday at the East Coast Conference Championships brought them a second place finish after having "" one of the poorest starts in the ECCs in recent years, ' ' according to Head Coach Dick Russell. Host LaSalle came out strong in the preliminaries Thursday and maintained first place throughout the com petition. Finishing with 495 points, they easily bested Bucknell's 334 points, while Temple finished a distant third with 281. Russell said "" we were flat on Thursday"" and as a result, the Bisons qualified for the finals in only three of the five events that day. "" It was all over before it even started,"" according to Russell. Bucknell ended the evening in fifth place after manag ing only 60 points in what the coach termed an "" earth- shattering day.""  "" They blew us right out of the pool,"" Russell commented on LaSalle's 98-point lead after the first day of action. The Bisons began to surge Friday with "" no place to go but up,"" according to senior Captain Pat Mitchell. Sophomores Dave Wakely and Mark Bongiorno began the rally Friday by taking first and second in the consolation round -- equivalent to seventh and eighth overall -- of the 400-yard individual medley with times of 4:15.1 and 4:16.6 seconds, respectively. The Bisons dominated the 200-yard freestyle by plac ing Mitchell second (1:43.8), Tim Jenkins '83 third (1:43.8) and senior Marc Corl fifth (1:45.1). Senior Scott Schulte led the charge in the 100-yard but terfly by placing fifth with a time of 53 seconds, while Tom Kane '83 and freshman Rich Callaghan finished seventh and eighth. Bongiorno, senior Chris Layton and Doug Haverland '84 came in sixth, ninth and tenth in the 100-yard backstroke. Senior Mark Gensheimer was the only Bucknell swim mer to advance into either the final or consolation round of the 100-yard breaststroke. Gensheimer, seeded sixth after the preliminaries, bettered his position with a time of 1:00.4, attaining a fourth place finish.

As Friday's last event, the relay "" left us on an up note for Saturday,""  according to Mitchell. This was, however, Bucknell's only win in the three-day event, con trasted by the nine events captured by LaSalle. The Bisons entered into the final day of competition 141 points behind LaSalle, holding only a slight eight-point margin over Lehigh. "" We were determined to hold onto second place,"" Mitchell said. Highlights of the day included the breaking of two school records, the most interesting of which involved shattering the record in three separate heats. Jenkins took Wakely's 200-yard butterfly record in the preliminaries, but Wakely was not to be denied and beat Jenkins' time in the next heat. Wakely went on to set the present record of 1:53.554 by placing second in the finals. Jenkins finished a strong third (1:54.2), Kane eighth and Callaghan twelfth in the event. A new school record was also set by the 400-yard freestyle relay unit of Schulte, Jenkins, Corl and Dan Dougherty '82 in 3:08.158. Corl and Schulte teamed up for a three-four showing in the 100-yard freestyle with 47.408 and 47.551 times. The Bisons picked up additional points in the 1650 freestyle as Dave Gassert '83 and Mitchell turned in fourth and sixth place showings. Divers scoring for Bucknell in the three-meter com petition were Dave Hartstein '83, and Tim Critchfield '83. The two sophomores managed 8th and 12th place finishes, respectively. Bison swimmers Gensheimer, Reg Blaber '84 and Jeff Payne '83 swept the consolations taking seventh through ninth places in the 200-yard breaststroke. Haverland went on to place third while Bongiorno took eighth place in the 200-backstroke with 1:58.978 and 1:59.912 times. Mitchell, Corl and Wakely are the only three Bisons representing the team this weekend in the Eastern Seaboard Championships at Dartmouth."

the 3-mile finals of the ECCs at Lehigh Saturday with a time of 14:27.7. Rick,
Sayre '82 took first in 14:01.9.,"By HANK BERKOWITZ Poor performances and a surprise show ing by Temple proved the stumbling blocks in the track team's defense of the East Coast Conference indoor title Satur day. The Bisons entered the meet as co favorites with Delaware and St. Joseph's, but it was the Owls of Temple who led the ECC pack with 102 points to gain the cham pionship. Bucknell limped to a disappoint ing third, being bested by St. Joe's for sec ond by the slim margin of 89 to 85.75. The Orange and Blue got off to an auspicious start in the early going by dominating the one- and three-mile runs, and it looked as if they were headed toward another romp. In the three-mile, the entire pack remained bunched together for the first fourteen laps until the swift early pace (4:41 at the mile) began taking its toll on most of the runners. Sensing an opportunity to break the field, Rick Sayre '82 made his move, open ing a 30-yard lead at the two-mile mark, and strode home to an easy victory in a perfectly paced 14:01.9. "" We wanted to let Delaware's (John) Kelsh take the pace out fast the first five or six laps and then move in front together and run 70's (for each 4Vi- mile) from there on in,""  Sayre said. Glenn Gibney '83 and Jim O'Shea '81 added valuable fifth and sixth place points, finishing in 14:22.7 and 14:28.9, respective ly. In the mile the trio of Mike DeBraggio '81, Steve Bigotto '82 and Mark Hulme '83 were apparently stuck in the middle of the pack with only one lap remaining, when Hulme suddenly stepped to the outside and made a furious charge over the final 150 yards, passing several runners along the way and cruising to a sparkling second place time of 4:08.9. Bigotto (3rd) and DeBraggio (4th) trailed Hulme in 4:11.4 and 4:11.6, and the Bisons demonstrated their prowess in the distance events once again. But things went awry soon afterward. Martin Carter '83 sprinted to a 6.42 in the 60 yard dash semifinals--the fastest time of the day--but crashed into the scorer's table after breaking the tape, and injured his hamstring. Carter pulled up lame after 40 yards in the disappointing finals. Additional problems occurred in the 2- mile relay. Bucknell's strong unit of Bigot to, Kaplan, DeBraggio and Hulme was tied for the lead before losing the baton after some jostling on the far side of the track. The group skidded to a disappointing fifth place. Unfortunately, most of the other disap pointments could be attributed to nothing other than sub-par performances and tac tical errors. Additional problems surfaced in the six field events, which produced only 10.75 noints. Freshman Scott Schneider took See MEN'S TRACK, page 18"

Resignation of,
Veep,
is requested,
Ferguson is the third to leave in four years,"By MATT KARANIAN Vice President for University Relations John Ferguson has been asked by the University to resign his position after less than a year on the Job, according to sources high in the administra tion. Although University President Dennis O'Brien at first hesitated to comment on Ferguson's status when asked early this week, he did say Ferguson's respon sibilities had been shifted and "" sharply focused"" on finding funds for the school's $3 million computer facilities campaign. Citing his policy of not discuss ing individual personnel matters publicly, O'Brien refused to publicly comment on the status of Ferguson -- the fourth ranking administrator here. Confirmation that Ferguson had been asked to leave his post came to the Bucknellian amid continuing rumors within Marts Hall about the firing and as part of a report of a major restructur ing of responsibilities at all levels of Bucknell's fund raising efforts. Both O'Brien and Ferguson were reported to play a key role in this "" restructuring."" O'Brien said Ferguson "" is still the vice president,"" but he said the resumption of his "" broad at the end of the academic year "" has yet to be determined."" O'Brien did say "" a shift in em phasis""  had occurred which had placed him in a more involved position in the development of fice. But he denied there were plans for anyone to be "" fired,"" saying in the same interview that the history of developmental and fund raising officials here was one "" of short turnovers."" Three men have served as vice president for University Rela tions at Bucknell in the last four years. The disclosure that Ferguson would be leaving Bucknell comes on the heals of the official an nouncement in November that he and his ll-member staff would begin coordinating the largest capital fund raising campaign in Bucknell history -- a $30 to $50 million drive that is hoped to bring major additions to the University's physical plant and endowment. The Office of University Rela tions had been recently granted permission to both expand its staff and increase the physical size of its office space -- in the form of a move by the staff out of Marts and into the former Cen tral Susquehanna Intermediate Unit building -- in order to pro vide additional support for the"

"BSA, ABS send 3 students to Atlanta","ByBILLTHUM In order to "" increase the awareness""  of University students to the murder and disappearance of 21 black children in Atlanta, the Black Student Alliance and Association of Bucknell Students have sent three BSU members to a rally in Atlanta this weekend. "" The situation in Atlanta is critical, and although we feel University students are informed and caring, we would like to increase student's sensitivity to the pro blem ,""  BSU President Kevon Makell '82 said. In this spirit, the BSA approached the ABS for funds to sponsor a trip to the rally in Atlanta. ABS Vice President Melissa Campbell '82 said, "" We discussed the situation with the BSA members and authorized a special appropriation of $150 to fund the"
Appeal for humanity,"trip.""  Campbell added, "" We hope the raUy and activities which follow help aid the fam ilies of the children and city of Atlanta to find strength in the face of this tragedy."" The BSA plans to follow up the rally with a formal presentation to the ABS. Green ribbons and arm bands - which have already been worn by the men's basketball team and been distributed at universities across the coun try _  will be provided for Bucknell students. "" The color green represents life and our interest in preserving it, ' ' Makell said. In addition to the ribbons, the BSA will begm fund raising activities to aid the effected families, Makell said. Although plans have not yet been finalized, the BSA hopes "" to generate enough support to make a substantial con tribution to the effort,""  he said. Of the 21 black children who have disappeared in the past 19 months, 20 have been found murdered either by suffocation or strangulation. The massive police investigation mounted by the city of Atlanta is costing approximately $250,000 a month, but as of yet, no solid evidence has been uncovered. Although the crim es involve only black children, "" we feel the awareness and concern for the deaths of any children must be shared by all,""  Makell said. "" At this point the racial differences break down as we must join to mourn for the tragedy."""

'82 listen to debate on the student scholarship program during the ABS,
meeting Tuesday night in Vedder Hall. The Congress voted to redirect schol,
"arship funds from minority applicants to those with ""leadership potentials","By JANET WILLIAMS and BILL THUM The Association of Bucknell Students voted unanimously at its Tuesday meeting to redirect the intent of the student scholarship program from promoting the ability of minorities to attend Bucknell towards the support of students with need who demonstrate leadership qualities. The student scholarship program, which since 1969 has been supported by a $5 por tion of the student activities fee, has been under evaluation by the ABS for three weeks. ABS President Michael Suarez '82 said it was difficult to reach a decision because of "" incomplete information."" "" The late 60s saw an increasing student awareness of the few minorities on cam pus along with a severe need for an in crease in the University's financial aid budget,"" ABS Vice President Melissa Campbell '82 said. "" With this as motiva- FHhoto--Mary wheian <<on, the student congress m ovedto show its concern through the establishment of its own financial aid fund using the student activities fee as its base,""  Campbell said. However, after an investigation by an ABS task force and interviews with ad ministration representatives, the ABS determined that the "" original political gesture of the scholarship fund was lost*' and the emphasis on helping minority students "" needed to be revised""  Suarez said. "" The needs of the University community were evaluated and the dilemma of stu dent activities and need for dynamic leaders was recognized,"" Suarez said The new policy calls for a continued use of $5 currently withheld from  the student activities fee to be given to the University Office of Financial Aid. The monies will be distributed as scholarship funds based on requirements of proven need and demon stration of leadership potential at the University. The policy further stipulated that the source, intent and purpose of the scholar ship aid be made known to all students who receive funds. The policy concluded with a call for review whenever the ABS petitions the University Board of Trustees to adjust the student activities fee. Suarez said the student gift of $15,000 an' nnally is a fine program "" which will now be directed at developing leadership potential at the University."""
Wallace ducks topic,
of CBS controversy,"By NANCY KERVIN Lorraine Perigord Wallace refused to comment on her hus band Mike W allace's attempts to prevent "" 60 Minutes""  from doing a news program on Haiti when she participated in a Class of '53 Lectureship panel discussion Tuesday night in the University Center Forum. "" I really don't have anything further to add. The story has been done so often by the press. But Mike did a very critical story on Haiti in 1972,""  she said. Although Mrs. Wallace, who form erly lived in Haiti and still has fam ily and business interests there, reportedly pressured her husband to ask his colleague Morley Safer not to film  another program on Haiti, "" 60 Minutes"" Executive Producer Don Hewitt has since ordered that the story be completed. In addition to Mrs. Wallace, NBC Vice President of Affiliate Relations Diane Healey and her husband, Peter Healey, a senior crude trader for Mobil Oil, were questioned by a panel composed of Bucknellian Editor David Hawkings '82, L'Agenda Editor Jim Zimmerman '81 and Liz Hawley '81 and Vernitia Shannon '81 of WVBU-FM. Although the discussion was en titled "" Meet the Spouse: Insight to the Inside,"" the guests answered questions on a variety of topics ranging from working women and their fam ilies to the Haiti controversy. When asked about her reaction to the controversy surrounding Mary Cunningham's resignation from her position as vice presi dent of Bendix Corp., Mrs. Healey said, "" The incident was a setback to me. She only made one mistake and that was accepting the position too quickly."" The speakers also discussed problems encountered by being married to public figures. "" It's a question of negotiation, just as it is with me and my husband's travels and the disruptions that have occurred,""  Mrs. Wallace said. "" Now it doesn't bother me at all, and my husband has becom e used to letting me do the things I want to do, like going to F iji to visit my son,""  she said.

Caf uses a new system,
to ease lunch congestion,"ByM .E. W EIL Longer lines outside the cafeteria may be the result of an effort to reduce congestion in ser ving areas during lunches, ac cording to David Christiansen '81 who is conducting a traffic flow study of the cafeteria. "" The new system seems to be working but it's not very easy to enforce,""  Christiansen said. "" We are trying to regulate the flow of diners into the service area by having the ticket punchers slow down the line, but that seems to be causing longer lines outside the service area,""  he said. Christiansen's study includes a plan to reorganize the lunch lines, regulate the flow of diners and to encourage people to change their eating schedules. According to Dining Service Director Hank Ross, "" Controlling the line is a good idea and the plan has helped somewhat, but we haven't solved anything yet."" Ross said the main problem is that "" there are more students with meal plans than the caf is designed for."" Christiansen's study is "" worth while because it could provide maximum use of the cafeteria,"" according to Ross, but "" it won't eliminate the problem.""  There must either be a change in the scheduling of classes to avoid the noon rush or provisions for more seating some place else,""  he said. The new system includes a line going through the center doors for students with fast passes. Ac cording to Christiansen, the nor mal line is stopped or slowed down when the service area becomes congested, while the fast pass line continues to move at a slower pace. Long lines outside the service area will .continue to be a pro blem as long as 70 percent of the students use the uphill entrance at peak times, according to Chris tiansen. He said notices will ap pear in What's Happening next week and posters will be put up encouraging students to use the downhill entrance at noontime. "" Before the University builds an addition to the UC, a shift in the academic class schedule is needed to alleviate the caf's capacity problem. We've got to try to use the facilities we have as efficiently as possible,""  Chris tiansen said. Christiansen said he would like to see more "" concern for the fellow students""  who are waiting outside the service area. "" If students moved more efficiently, it would reduce the waiting time for all and save frustration,""  he said. Catherine Samra '81, a cafeteria meal ticket puncher, said the new system is "" suc cessful but we need people to cooperate. It is not that easy to implement."" The traffic flow study is part of Christiansen's senior civil engineering project. Christiansen said he will begin evaluating the results of the study next week. Pho to-- M egan Yo ung Students stand in two lines inside the uphill doors of the cafeteria in the University Center at noon W ednesday. The separate lines for meal ticket and fast pass holders are part of the caf's new traffic flow system intended to ease congestion during lunch."
Model of campus undergoes revision,"By CIND Y CROSSLEY The model of the University's present and plann ed buildings and grounds is being revised to in clude recent changes in the University's plans for expansion. The Bethlehem Model Company is making the necessary revisions in the model, which is normal ly displayed in front of the Information Desk in the University Center. The change that prompted the model's revision is the addition of the completed computer center, according to Director of the Physical Plant John Bell. Another change is the restructure of the propos ed life sciences building from a round bidding to a group of six buildings, Bell said. The modified design is intended to complement the architecture of the computer center, according to Bell. The model will also be modified to show a "" rough guess""  of the design of the planned library addi tion. Other revisions include the addition of the completed platform tennis courts, a color change of the football stadium from white to gray to in dicate its completion, a change in the labels of the fraternities to their initials, and the addition of some walks. Bell said he and Vice President for Administra tion and Finance John Zeller decided in mid- January to bring the model up-to-date with the completion of the computer center. "" Since the model only reflects current thinking, anything we put there in white is suggestive and not necessarily the final plan. It only shows our potential plans as they appear to be at this time,"" Bell said. The cost of revising the model will be between $800 and $1200, according to Zeller. The model is expected to be returned from Bethlehem by mid-April. ____ i"

The meeting, which dealt with any of the events planned by the caucus, ended in a proposal for action to be taken against the manuevers -- which are scheduled to occur March 21 in the field behind Swartz Hall -  BPC member Britt Clayton '81 said. Although definitive plans have not yet been made, the caucus is draf ting a letter to University President Den nis O'Brien, Director of Military Science Lt Col. James King, the Association of Bucknell Students and the Bucknellian. The letter will protest the use of the cam pus for military training and tactical manuevers. Professor of English Karl Pat- ten said. The whole idea of training in- dividuals to kill is against the basic tenets of the Caucus, Andy Brody '82 said. pians for a formal protest rally will not be finalized until a response to the Caucus demand to halt the manuevers is received. In other action, the Caucus discussed the draft of a letter to O'Brien, Director of Residential Life Brenda Gordon, Provost Wendell Smith, Director of Admissions Richard Skelton and the Pennsyivama Council on Human Relations. The letter calls for a change in the University s "" segregationalist"" room assignment policy, the establishment of a policy on stu dent diversity, the elimination of "" discriminatory"" questions on the admis sions application and the formation of co ed freshman dormitories, Patten said. Also discussed were plans for activities centered on May 1, the International Labor Day.

Architect lectures on problems of center,_ *

U,a K n i r )
By David Hawkings,"Creating a physical home for the arts at an institution like BuckneU is an extremely difficult task that should none the less be one of the University's top priorities, the design and planning director for the National Endowment for the Arts said here Monday. Although the technical, aesthetic and financial problems en countered in constructing buildings for the arts -- especially the per forming arts -- often seem insurmountable and contradictory, the creation of such a center ""would be highly rewarding for you/' Mjphnoi pittas told a group of students, arts faculty, local University benefactors and top administration officials. Speaking to a group of about 50 in the University Center Forum, Pittas described the complex process of creating a space for universi ty and visiting performing artists that appeases and appeals to per former and audience. Such a center should be a work of art in itself, he said, adding that this is a much easier goal to accomplish if all parties concerned with the building and the institution it is for are consulted thoroughly in the planning stages. , , . . . ____ . Pittas' visit to Bucknell and his discussion of designing arts centers during this year's Celebration of the Arts week coincides with a renewed emphasis by the Association for the Arts on what it calls its ""chief aim"" -- that of bringing about the construction of just such a center on campus. , . _ . . Association for the Arts Secretary and Associate Professor of English Ralph Rees said at thelecture that the desire to open a aiscus- sion about the feasibility of such a center here also prompted the association to realize that the primary artist who would be involved in such a project -  the architect -  had been previously Ignored during 016 Ptttas said, however, that this is not unusual for what he and other architects have termed ""the mother of the arts."""

Rampal's brilliance stuns the crowds,Photo -- Kate Cross
"Jean-Pierre Rampal, the master with the golden flute, came to Rooke",
Chapel on Wednesday. The capacity crowd left astonished at the depth of,
"emotion in his playing. Here, he prepares for the concert in the office of",
"James Hammerlee, the director of student activities and University Center",
"programs. Hammerlee also coordinates the Artists Series, which sponsored",
Rampal's visit.,
By David O'Connell,"More than 950 people crowded into Rooke Chapel Wednesday to hear Jean-Pierre Rampal, the world's premier flutist, pre sent a stunning display of technical vir tuosity and musicianship. In what is certain to be remembered as a classic among Artist Series programs here, Rampal gave the audience a study in contrasts both in his programming choices and in his renditions of those pieces. Recognized universally as a master in terpreter of Baroque music, Rampal devoted the first half of his program to sonatas by J.S. Bach and two of his sons -- J.C.F. and C.P.E. Bach -- followed by Cor elli's Variations on La Folia. In contrast to this, the artist proved himself equally suited to more contemporary works by Martinu, Enesco and Poulenc. Opening with the J.C.F. Bach work, Rampal and accompanist John Steele Rit ter immediately exhibited precise ensem ble in a movement which placed the harp sichord quite in the foreground. Indeed, Ritter was stellar throughout the evening, as harpsichord in the first half and later at the piano. Rampal's Baroque allegros were con sistently light and airy, with almost ef fortless flow in the more difficult passages. His slow movements presented a carefree and timeless progression through musical expressionism. One might find fault with the tempo -- adagios taken as andantes to enhance the virtuosi ty of running passages, for example -- but the music never rushed past. It was par ticularly gratifying that the fast movements were not taken at a hectic clip, as Rampal has sometimes been known to do. Specifically, the lack of frantic urgency so common in Baroque music was quite pleasing in the C.P.E. Bach sonata. Writ ten for solo flute, the piece thus allowed Rampal the freedom to express his musical ideas with no restraints and no one pushing him. Perhaps the best music made in the first part of the program was in the final allegro movement of the J.S. Bach sonata. Con trasting lyrical and punctuated passages, Rampal showcased his ability to make abrupt transitions in mood and dynamics effortlessly. The Corelli piece was a further chance to exhibit contrasts. Beginning with a bold theme statement, Rampal ran through a wide range of musical emotions, as each 16-measure variation seemed to be the op posite of its predecessor, yet at the same time flowed naturally from it. The second half of the program gave the artist a chance to depart from some of the Baroque predictabilities and reach for even greater heights. At times the music became secondary to its rendition; Ram- pal's phrasing was impressive beyond all else. The Adagio in the Martinu sonata was one of the beSSt slow movements of the evening, as a mystical, perhaps even haunting color was painted. This was followed by a precisely quick Allegro -- where Rampal's fast trills stole the spotlight. The first true presto occurred in the Enesco. In this running, rolling move ment, a feeling of perpetual motion was created. This was even surpassed in the closing presto of the Poulenc; its final furious bars brought the concert to an elec trifying close. Rampal obliged the audience's standing ovations with three encores. The first was a virtuostic presto by Carl Maria von Weber, followed by the Sentimentale from the popular Claude Bolling Suite for Flute and Jazz Piano. A very suave rendition brought the crowd to its feet once again. Rampal sent the audience home after a furiously fast technical display of a Chopin work. One is left with an overall impression of combined excellence in both technique and musicianship. This versatility -- the abili ty to let technique speak for itself without overshadowing the music -- distinguishes Rampal from most concert artists. One could make the comparison to violinist Eugene Fodor's appearance here two years ago. Fodor is remarkable in his technical brilliance, but this is all he has to offer. Rampal successfully adds that extra touch of lyricism and phrasing. It is most difficult to pinpoint why the concert had such an electrifying effect and musical impact. This is only superceded by the difficulty of trying to cut through one's awe and find anything of substance that can be objectively "" criticized."""
JOHN HOUSEMAN,
Houseman lectures on 'Seven Theatres ' ;,
has wealth o f talent as an actor and writer,
By Robin Meredith,"Award-winning actor John Houseman will speak in Rooke Chapel tonight at 7:30 on the topic of "" My Seven Theatres""  and will conduct a workshop on the University Theatre at 10 a.m. Saturday. Although most students recognize Houseman for his role as Professor Kingsfield in ""The Paper Chase -- for which he won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Ac tor -- his involvement in theater and films long predates World War II. "" There aren't many men still alive that have had the impact Houseman has had. He is an exceedingly impor tant man of the theater,"" according to Harvey Powers, director of the University Theatre. Houseman's first opportunity came in 1933 when, after meeting the American composer Virgil Thompson, he pro duced and directed the Gertrude Stein-Virgil Thompson opera Four Saints in Three Acts, acknowledged to be one of the most inventive and exciting productions ever to ap pear on stage. Houseman, together with Orson Welles, conceived and produced a version of "" Macbeth"" set in Haiti named "" Voodoo Macbeth"" with conjurers and voodoo drums and an entirely black cast. He also assisted Welles in panick ing America with the famous radio broadcast, "" War of the Worlds."" His productions in film include "" The Blue Dahlia,"" "" They Live By Night,""  ""The Bad and the Beautiful,"" "" Julius Caesar"" (the Marlon Brando version), "" The Un seen"" and "" Executive Suite."" He has appeared on television in "" Six Characters in Search of an Author,"" "" Bionic Woman,"" "" The Captains and the Kings,"" "" Washington"" and ""Aspen."" "" The Paper Chase"" series is being repeated on Public Television this season. ' Houseman, who began his career late in life, has had roles in the popular movies "" Roller Ball,"" "" Three Days of the Condor,"" "" The Cheap Detective,"" "" My Bodyguard,"" "" Old Boy Friends,"" and the film version of "" The Paper Chase,"" extending his work to all mediums. He has also been active in teaching theater and established the drama department at the Juilliard School in New York. He later formed "" The Acting Company"" with the best of his students there and began touring throughout the country. Although it is not certain what Houseman is planning for his Saturday morning workshop, "" he may come to see "" Our Town"" and talk about the theatre and actor training in the context of the play,"" Powers said."

Music revisited by,
a talented couple,
By Lynne Rutherford,"Clifford and Georgette Reims -- experts on Victorian era vocal music -- presented a multi-media program on their joint subject mat ter Thursday afternoon in the University Center Forum. The Reims' format included singing, slide shows and piano ac companiment by Associate Professor of Music Darina Tuhy. Reims, a university alumnus, is the chairman of the vocal department at Roosevelt University in Chicago. Both he and his wife are well known throughout the Chicago area as soloists and as presenters of operatic productions of various kinds. Reims, a tenor, and his wife, a soprano, utilized their pleasant and well-trained voices to vocalize the delicate, often poetic Victorian pieces. Featured were the works of three eminent English composers: Samuel Lover, John Hullah and William G. Cusins. Compositions were usually of the writer's lesser known works. Lover (1797-1868) was a well-known painter and writer before loss of his eyesight inspired him to embark on his career as a songwriter. He produced a number of "" Irish Evenings""  -  comic songs -  as well as hauntingly beautiful ballads. "" The Fairy Boy"" , "" My Mother Dear,"" "" True Love Can Ne'er Forget,"" and "" The Low Back'd Car"" were the pretty melodies sung by Mrs. Reims here. Hullah (1812-1884) was an all-encompassing musician and composer who exercised a profound influence on the music of the Victorians. Highlighting the Hullah works was a libretto to his comic opera "" The Village Coquette""  (1836) written by Charles Dickens. This obscure work narrowly escaped a fire at the Edinburgh Theatre, where the en tire score was lost. Other Hullah works heard by the 50 in attendance at the Thursday show were "" Some Folks who Have Grown Old"" and "" How Beautiful at Eventide,"" both sung by the soprano. A number of more melancholy selections were taken from A Tribute to Alfred, Lord Tennyson, a musical album edited by organist, com poser and conductor W illiam G. Cusins. They included "" Rain, Rain and Sun""  by Joseph Joachim, "" The Lute Song""  by C. Villiers Stanford and "" Ring Out, Wild Bells""  by Charles Gounod. , ' 4 . The original program afforded some of the best living history of a culture that ended a short time ago yet is so far removed from our pre sent artistic ideals. __________________ i i U i U g g"

Swenson gives a poetry reading,
Highly honored writer is,
popular with students,
By Laura Carm elich,"The most honored poet alive, May Swenson brought her versatile and brilliant craft to campus Thursday in a true celebration of the arts. Following a poetry workshop in the Creative Arts house here, Swenson presented a reading of her works to an attentive audience of more than 100 in the University Center Forum. The first group of poems she read dealt mainly with the eccentricities of New York City's in habitants. Frequently, these poems sounded more like prose than verse, as Swenson strung together long lists of adjectives and descriptive phrases about her native city. Swenson termed the next selections her "" love poems,""  and in these combined traditional roman tic language with fresh images of the embracing and wrestling activities of lovers in the sea. Following these poems were four selections deal ing with science and outer space. Of all Swenson's poems, these most clearly showed her striking ver satility. At one moment, Swenson attacked the ab surdity of space-age jargon; at the next, she was comparing a satellite view of the earth to the image of a beautifully graceful woman. Scattered among these thematic groups were Swenson's serious and poignant pieces dealing with her personal experiences of family, friends and childhood. In one particularly touching piece -- en titled "" Feel Me""  -- Swenson described the death of her father and the loneliness of old age.

SWENSON,"regulated pace with a subtly humorous tone or sud den inflection. Still, her vibrant and sensitive perceptions of the world attracted and held the au dience for the length of her presentation. Swenson was born in Utah and completed her education at Utah State University in 1939. After college she moved to New York, settling in Green wich Village where among other jobs she worked as an editor at New Directions Press. While most of Swenson's writing career developed in the New York area, she spent one year in France, Italy and Spain on an Amy Lowell Traveling Scholarship. The author of 10 books, Swenson's most notable works include Another Animal, A Cage of Spines, To Mix with Time, Half Sun, Half Sleep and More Poems to Solve. Her latest collection of poems, New and Selected Things Taking Place, won her the 1979 Fellowship of the Academy of American Poets. More recently, Swenson received the Bollingen Prize in poetry from Yale University, an honor she shares with Howard Nemerov."

A presentation on theater administration featur ing Ed Davis, a senior partner in Theatre Now Inc. in New York, and Peter Schmener and Janice Eckmann, actors' representatives, will be held at 1:30 p.m. The three will discuss how to break into the business side of the theater and how to find an agent.

Cap and Dagger celebrates,
80,
th,
with exploration o f themes on life,
By David Blackman,"The fourth Cap and Dagger production of the academic year opens at 9 tonight in Coleman Theatre. Under the direction of Allen Haines '81, "" Our Town""  marks the finale of a successful week of artistic events as well as the 80th anniversary of Cap and Dagger, the University's theater organization. Thornton Wilder's classic exploration of small town life has retained popularity over the years due to its timeless message. But because of its popularity, the play is con tinually produced with a decided tendency towards mediocrity. , Director Haines wishes to overcome this problem. "" This play can be produced on two levels. The first super ficially, depicting the simple pleasures of small town life without emphasizing the crucial message which I believe Wilder had in mind. Second, it may be produced as a biting commentary on humanity pointing out the drastic flaws of our complacent lifestyles. I wish to portray the se cond level,""  Haines said. According to the director, the play talks about life in a bubble""  where people exist in a stifled provincial society. "" People have the potential to change and break out of this bubble, but they choose not to simply because it's easier and that's the way it's always been,""  Haines said. To convey this theme, which Haines sees as infinitely more important than the actual plot of "" Our Town,"" he has attempted to change the role of the Stage Manager from that of a mere narrator who becomes a member of the town and lives within the period -- much like the other characters -- to a provoker of thought and action who spans all periods of time from 1904 to the present and beyond. ,,  . , . ,,  , "" This play is not a tribute to small towns, but rather"

People should leave thinking about their own lives,""  said Barry Fishel, who portrays the pivotal role. "" Our Town""  is very reflective of my own philosophy in life,""  said Gwyn English '81, who portrays Emily Webb. "" As Emily realizes, if you don't live your life to the fullest, appreciate all it has to offer, and realize you don't live forever, you miss so much of the love which is basic to our humanity."" Besides thematic problems, Haines and Stage Manager Bruce Delaplane '81 also had to deal with the more prac tical aspects of the production, including the scant three weeks allowed for rehearsal and crew time after the per formance dates were pushed up to fit the Celebration of the Arts week. Although many seasoned Cap and Dagger veterans were cast in "" Our Town,""  there is much fresh talent as well."

"O'Grady, a worldwide respected artist, is here through",
special arrangement with Julius Bloom.,"Lack of interest and funds appear to have stifled activities in Hulley House, the University's creative arts special interest residence. When Hulley House was first formed by 17 students in September, Marty Wieland '83-- resi dent assistant and leader of the group-said, "" We'd like to sponsor things that wouldn't normally be sponsored by other groups."" Wieland also said the house's ultimate goal was to "" provide a center for the arts on campus."" Seven months later, as the residence has failed to take an active part in this week's Celebration of the Arts, plans seem to have gone awry. Although Weiland and Mary Ann LaCroix '81, stu dent coordinator of arts week, tried to contact each other several times, they were never able to make definite plans. As a result, several events have utilized the house's living room, but the Hulley House group has failed to sponsor anything of its own. "" Our schedules were just different--we were never able to get each other on the phone,""  said Wieland. "" They never did get a hold of us and we never took the initiative."" Several artistic events--a student poetry reading and a bluegrass jam  session, among others--were scheduled but for varying reasons--all clouded with confusion and lack of communication--they fell through. Money is also a problem for the Hulley House group. The program was reviewed by the ABS Ap propriations Committee Tuesday and awarded only $35 for operating expenses. "" We can't exist on no money. Right now, we're trying to invent things students can do for free,"" Wieland said. One activity Wieland remains enthusiastic about is the musician's jam  sessions held in the house this semester. "" These jam  sessions create an outlet for the many closet musicians on campus,""  he said. Other planned events--a fiddler's contest and spring folk festival--are also in jeopardy due to lack of funds. "" The size and scope of what we can do second semester entirely depends on how much money we can raise,""  Wieland said."

Street theatre troupe has,
many messages for onlookers,
By Ted Loud,"In the midst of the lunchtime rush hour, the mall of the Univer sity Center became the scene of an unusual and very exciting hap pening Thursday afternoon. Sud denly, without warning, a street theater dropped in to present "" The Moveable Feast."" The steady flow of UC traffic was invaded by a band of masked figures dancing to the music of pre-recorded bongo drums. Com ing through the downhill doors, they paraded through the Bison, drawing smiles and polite ap plause. They stopped for a few minutes to perform for the busy and bustling crowd. The troup then forged a path to the refectory, where they enter tained the unprepared but amus ed faculty diners. And then they were gone. Although it may have seemed a bit frivolous, "" The Moveable Feast"" dealt with relevant issues, specifically America's role in the current situation in El Salvador. Using simple but ex tremely clever and effective domestic props and working from a short narrative recited by a masked story-teller (Stu Gay '82), "" Feast""  presented a view of the conflict which was highly critical of U.S. policy. Drawing on the "" guns and but ter metaphor,""  a loaf of bread was transformed into an airplane with "" U.S."" emblazoned on the w i n g s ."
A,"r i g h t  w i n g "" m ercenary,"" personifying a repressive junta, then battered a defenseless Salvadorian into the ground, with the loaf of bread. The performances were all spirited and somewhat disturb ing, though never heavy-handed. The "" instant""  audience reacted with surprise and amusement, everyone apparently happy for this break in the noon-day routine. Jeffry Walker--the visiting assistant professor of English and Theater now on leave--said his objective is to use theater as a means of dealing with the issues that affect us all. He said he ob jects to the way art has been "" wrapped up and sold""  and would like to see a less formaliz ed and threatening atmosphere surrounding the arts. Ideally, he envisions a "" theatrical SWAT team""  -- a group always ready to present spur-of-the-moment per formances about m ajor issues as they arise. Walker said this week's UC performances are "" spontaneous and silly""  reactions to the recent events in El Salvador, but it is their very immediacy which he said gives these performances their importance. The street theater will present "" The Moveable Feast""  again at noon Saturday."

Officials say Cuba,
cut aid to Salvador,"Recently acquired information in d ica tes that the anti- Govemment insurgents in El Salvador are running out of am munition because of an apparent decision by Nicaragua and Cuba to reduce their assistance, ac cording to Administration of ficials. Although the officials said Wednesday that the intelligence information was not conclusive, there was a growing belief within the Administration that the flow of arms to the left-wing rebels in El Salvador through Nicaragua had been drastically cut back for the past few weeks. The Reagan Administration has been careful in handling the intelligence information because it does not want to undercut its justification for giving military aid to El Salvador. Officials also said there has been less activity and involve ment by Cuba in helping the El Salvador rebels recently. President Reagan issued a pro posal to Congress Tuesday outlin ing a $695 'billion budget for the fiscal year 1982 that he explained is the centerpiece of his plan to "" stop runaway inflation""  and "" revitalize the economy"" by decreasing the role of the federal government. In a brief budget message, Reagan issued a warning to lawmakers who might oppose the numerous cuts in many non military programs, and ex plained that "" the next steps are up to Congress."""

Leaders and puppets,
The unanimous decision of the ABS Congress Tuesday to redirect,
its student scholarship program from aiding minority applicants to,
"aiding those who demonstrate what they call "" leadership potential""",
demonstrates the inferior quality of student leaders already atten,
ding the University. Do we need to encourage more of the same?,
"Although the vote followed discussions held at three meetings, the",
entire congress came to the same conclusion in the end; the Univer,
"sity needs "" dynamic leaders""  more than it needs to encourage",
qualified minority students to attend what has been described as a,
""" white middle-class school.""",
It appears that ABS President Michael Suarez has such complete,
control over his congress that not even one member voted against,
his proposal.,
"If ABS members are examples of the "" dynamic leaders""  the",
"University is so desperately in need of, why are they all of the same",
opinion? This is usually expected of followers--not leaders.,
It is disturbing to find the scholarship funds redirected at the,
"whim of the president, not only because of the apparent lack of in",
dependent thinking of the ABS members--whose unity often seems,
to be all too staged--but also because of the consequences of their ac,
tions.,
"At a time when students should be growing, the ABS is regressing;",
"it has shot down a well intentioned "" affirmative action"" policy of",
"another congress. $15,000 of our student activities fees will now be",
"directed to 'dynamic leaders""  in what we see as a euphemistic way",
"of avoiding "" reverse discrimination"" .",
If the Congress is looking for things to do to keep busy and to keep,
"the attention of its members, it would be better advised to attempt to",
"display some of the leadership they are looking for themselves,",
"rather than to seek to "" cleanse""  themselves of what little vestige of",
progressivism remains in their organizazion.,
Good Luck,
We've heard it said that most people never outgrow the paranoia,
they experienced when they were children and a new kid moved in,
down the street *,
"It is quite a different emotion, however, that we greet the",
"newest--indeed, the only memorable--addition to the journalistic",
""" block""  on which we have lived alone too long. There is for us no",
fear of competition or rivalry as the Bucknell Progressive Caucus,
launches its first Catechist. Quite the contrary--we welcome the,
company.,
In attempting to provide a frequent journal of discussions for,
"progressive issues, Stu Gay and the other editors of this new publica",
tion are undertaking a worthy but difficult task. The introduction of,
any new ideas and ideamakers into a college community is always,
"welcome, but the method to the madness is probably more con",
voluted and complex than they yet realize. As we sit here at the,
printers amidst a mountain of copy and a flurry of rulers and x-acto,
"knives, we wonder--momentarily--if it's all worthwhile. Then we",
"turn back to the typewriter, assured that it is.",
"We hope you always remain as assured as we are, Catechist.",
Good luck.,

"In a vivid portrayal of American solidarity and pride, we took to",
displaying and wearing yellow ribbons two months ago. But the ugly,
"hostage episode eventually passed, the ribbons were removed and",
"the nation was able to get back on its feet, a heavy burden lifted from",
its shoulders.,
Now--in another display of bonded American spirit--students na,
tionwide are sporting green armbands and ribbons. Green sym,
"bolizes life, and the armbands and ribbons memorialize the 20",
children slain in Atlanta since 1979.,
The Black Student Alliance here is to begin distributing the arm-,
bands soon; they also plan to raise money to send to the families of,
the murdered children. We hope the students here will join with the,
Americans nationwide who have donned the ribbons and armbands,
as a symbolic display of unity.,
And we pray the city of Atlanta will soon be able to get back on its,
"feet, so its children--and its adults--can begin to lead the happy,",
growing lives they are entitled to lead.,

Lefever makes human rights u-turn,
By Phil Andrews,
"What do Ernest Lefever, President Reagan's controver",
sial nominee to head the State Department's Human,
"Rights Bureau, and Professor of Political Science and",
"Religioh, Douglas Sturm, have in common?",
"Not much, except that they have known each other since",
1953 when they worked together at Christian Action -- an,
"organization funded by Paul Tillich, Reinhold Niebuhr",
and others to fight McCarthyism.,
PHILLING IN,
"Of all of Reagan's appointments, Lefever's has drawn",
the sharpest fire. This is no surprise given Lefever s,
statements regarding human rights policies and,
strategies.,
"To wit: In Congressional testimony in 1974, Lefever",
argued against moralizing about government - sponsored,
torture in Argentina and Chile because it has to be,
"understood ""as a residual practice of the Iberian tradi-",
"^Tlie New York Times, in an editorial on March 2, noted",
"""It has been Mr. Lefever's vocation to promote a single",
idea: that the United States should not penalize faithful,
allies by making too much fuss about any blood on the,
"* carpet.""",
"On the other hand, Times columnist William Safire",
"described Lefever as ""A lesser-of-evils theologian who",
believes we must provide arms to allies to put down insur,
rection. Lefever's aggressive pragmatism appalls,
"idealists.""",
I asked Sturm about Lefever's theological philosophy.,
He made the following observations.,
"""Lefever has conceived himself to be a follower of the",
"Biblical realism of Reinhold Niebuhr -- that is, you have",
to take into account the hard realities of political and,
economic circumstances in making decisions.,
"""It seems to me that in many respects he is, but he does",
not discern by orientation with quite the subtlety that,
"Niebuhr himself did,"" he said, citing Lefever's opposition",
to Niebuhr's criticism of the Vietnam war.,
"With regard to Lefever's political philosophy, Sturm",
"said ""He sees national self-interest as fundamentally a",
"moral concept, and each nation must act on behalf of its",
"self-interest.""",
"""Thus, a realistic position would require any nation -",
state to make sure that it's got ample power to protect its,
"boundaries, but also ample power to protect its sphere of",
"influence,"" Sturm said.",
I asked Sturm where he disagreed with Lefever.,
"""For one thing,"" Sturm said, ""I think the nation - state",
system is not as hard and fast as I think he perceives.,
"There are already political linkages, but also economic",
and cultural linkages that means the world is not organiz,
"ed in a simple nation - state fashion.""",
"""These people are quite as realistic in a way as Lefever,",
but in another way their realism is deeper and pro,
"founder, because they see merging sentiments among",
peoples the world around -- sentiment that would provide,
some kind of grounding in ideas of human rights,
understood in the economic and cultural sense.,
"Third, Sturm argued that ""one cannot sit idly by when a",
national organization or government is engaged in activi,
ty that oppresses the people who exist within that national,
boundary.,
". ,,",
"""We must admit that our responsibility is not just a dis-",
DOUGLAS STURM,
"tant responsibility of sibling for sibling, for it seems to me",
that by various kinds of aid. By virtue of the extent of our,
"corporations, we are in ways responsible for the condi",
tions of peoples the world around.,
"""Given that fact, we simply cannot wash our hands. The",
important question is not so much interference or non - in,
"terference, it's the character of the interference,"" Sturm",
"Sajfs the Times said, Lefever's ""criticism of human rights",
legislation is not frivolous and is worthy of debate. What is,
frivolous is nominating him to head a bureau whose func,
"tion he derides.""",

"!.n n/,n<<pni nf nnr enmre nf",
Tlndoubtedlv. The right thing to do? I,
By Britt Clayton,
Governments require consent. Their,
authority is borrowed. Their decisions are,
legitimate and effective only when we,
agree to abide by the authority we have,
granted them.,
"There is, however, an inherent problem",
in our democratic system of decision mak,
ing. Majority rules. Only a fraction of the,
populace has its way in choosing its,
ieaders.,
"We, the minority, must succumb to the",
brute force of the majority. By virtue of,
"our number, those men and women",
representing our ideals have been denied,
office.,
We have,
been,
denied,
self-,
government every time our number was,
less.,
"Do I propose minority rule? No, that",
would be as absurd as military or dictator,
rule. It is not the number of people respon,
sible for choosing leaders that is in ques,
tion here. It is the concept of ruling at all.,
Even the majority has no control over,
what their government does once they,
have elected it. While the branches of our,
"government must answer to one another,",
they need not reckon with authority until,
election day.,
"Even at the polls, we are allowed to",
choose only between the representatives of,
"our two political parties. In short, our self-",
government is limited to deciding which of,
the candidates we prefer. Majority deci,
sion. Minority rule.,
What do I suggest? Anarchy. While those,
of us who are dissatisfied by virtue of our,
"number cannot decide who rules, that need",
"not concern us. We have seen that ""ruling""",
is a perversion of self-government in the,
first place. What we may do is withdraw,
our consent--ignore their decisions.,
The only good government is self-,
government. None of us is free unless he is,
"exclusively under his own control, or",
under the consented control of some rule of,
"which he wholeheartedly approves, in",
which case no rule is necessary.,
"One may interject here: ""How can we",
live without organization? Without the,military
"and the judiciary, we would be in",
"a state of chaotic vulnerability.""",
The response to this censure is two-fold.,
"First, we must take the law into our own",
"hands, and secondly, we must remove the",
conditions barring us from a more in,
dependent subsistence.,
In a land where people are not reliant on,
"conglomerate utilities, communications,",
"industries, money markets and food",
"distributors, a takeover would have to pro",
ceed one house at a time--against a heavi,
ly armed population.,
.,
.,
How many soldiers would it take to stifle,
all of our churches?...to seize all of the,
family-owned farms?... to shut down all,
newspapers ?.. .all,
hospitals ?.. .every,
school?...to seize control of our source of,
solar energy?,
It is the centralization of resources that,
makes a takeover possible. By ridding,
ourselves of government and other con,
glomerate parasites that feed on our,
"laziness, we can restore law and order to",
its original source while reuniting the pro,
ductive and consumptive modes of our,
lives. As moral agents--agents capable of,
producing pain and pleasure in others--we,
are obliged to withdraw our consent from,
any system of rule which insults our moral,
sensibilities.,
Idealistic? Impractical? Dangerous.,
Undoubtedly. The right thing to do? I,
believe so. Tt will not be easy. But we can,
no longer let intimidation supercede moral,
responsibility. We must draw lines and,
"step over them, thereby demarking our",
government's influence.,
"I urge you to lead a happy, productive,",
"morally responsible life, ignorant of",
"government, wherever you will. The time",
is coming. The burden is ours.,

"Please Mr. Postman, is",
there a letter for me?,
By Jim Zim m erm an,"I stumbled upon a fascinating revelation the other day. Back when I was a freshman -- and God, that seems like a long time ago -- we all had somewhat of a fetish with the mailroom. No matter what time of the day we passed through the University Center, there was a perfunctory stop at our boxes. We never seem ed to learn that real mail came by 10:30 a.m. and that campus mail was distributed by three. Five times a day, seven days a week -- even Sunday brunch included a mail check -- we inspected our boxes in the hopes of a delivery. Maturity set in the summer after freshman year. All of a sudden, it was no longer cool to check for mail. Sophomore year, one stop became the daily maximum per person; by the time we were juniors, it was fashionable to pass through the mail room once a week. Most of us fell prey to using the excuse, "" Sorry, but I never check my mail any more."" Well, now I'm'a senior, and I think I'm wearing the numbers off of the combination lock on my mailbox. I take comfort in the fact that I'm not alone. Every time I check for mail, the faces around me are familiar. Unlike back when we were freshmen, however, we are not checking five times a day, but 10; we no longer stop every time we pass through the UC. Now we make special trips. It's funny how a Celebration of the Arts brochure looks like a law school rejection through a little window. Similarly, all around me, those familiar faces are "" certain""  that a Sears Credit Card Ap plication is a Bank of Maryland secondary interview offer, or that the little card that says only "" your file is now complete,""  is really an acceptance letter from the Columbia School of Medicine. It's a vicious game, yet we all keep on playing it. The news each of us wants to see is so rarely there, but not one of us is willing to take the chance that our acceptance letter could sit there over night. In some ways I feel like a freshman again. But more importantly, in one way, I wish I were a freshman again. It seems to me it was more fun to check over and over for a letter from a friend, a package from home or a five dollar check from a grandmother than I know it is for most of us to check continually for some type of a response -- and usually find nothing at all. Jim Zimmerman, a senior political science major from Montoursville, has been constantly checking his mailbox hoping for a law school acceptance."
LETTERS,
Avant-garde forms next best thing to bones?,"To the Editor: David Blackman described the exhibit of Diane Stiglich's objects by conveniently using quotes from students like "" wild,"" "" wonderfully disturbing"" and "" just incredible.""  He was being Jtoo nice. We have never seen such a varied display of glittering ob jects and avante-garde forms in our entire lives, and we hope that we never will again. After visiting the Center Gallery for the past few years, this exhibit clear ly stands out in our minds as the next best thing to last year's bone exhibit. Instead of transforming the art prints, man-made objects and photographs into spariding crea- tions, they would be better left alone. Stiglich wants to imitate real life and evoke images of nature through m an-m ade things. Nature is already polluted enough. Scott Bolhack '81 Jeff Heine'81 Richard Cautilli '81 March 10,1981"
A  generous,
5,
contribution puts arts in its place,"To the Editor: On behalf of the Creative Arts House, I would like to thank the ABS for their generous contribution to our cause. Last Tuesday night, they appropriated a whopping $35 for the promotion of the creative arts at Bucknell. Now I realize that our original request of $350 was totally unreasonable. After all, we are not a major concern like the Rifle Club (which received $600 this year). The arts have their own little place at Bucknell, and they should stay there. I was surprised that we got the $35. Some of our items were a bit unreasonable, which the Ap propriations Committee was quick to point out. $10 for poster board was admittedly extravagant, since 20 posters for a semester's worth of activities could easily lead to an advertising overkill. Our other items were likewise subjected to the committee's penetrating scrutiny, but in the end we came $35 richer. Thanks, ABS. You're a helluva group. Marty Weiland '83 March 11,1981"

St. Joe's victorious in ECCs,
"by upsetting American, 63-60","By JEFF CROSS PHILADELPHIA--Despite the absence of the once Breakin' Bisons for the first time since 1978, the East Coast Conference basketball champion ships went on here last weekend--and ended with a titillating finish. Traditional conference power St. Joseph's staged a furious rally in the final three minutes to upend ECC regular season champion American, 63-60, before 6,150 fans at the Palestra Saturday. The triumph by St. Joe's avenged an 84-83 setback to the Eagles three weeks ago and gave the Hawks an automatic berth in the NCAA champion ships. In the semifinals Friday night, American trounced Rider--quarterfinal round conquerors of Bucknell March 2 by a 68-50 score--99-80 while St. Joe's handed Lafayette a 73-63 setback. . American was selected for the 32-team National Invitational Tournament a n d ^ a s eliminated by Toledo 91-83 Wednesday to finish 24-6. St. Joe's put its 22-7 record on the line in an NCAA preliminary round contest against Missouri Valley Conference winner Creighton (21-8) Thursday night in Dayton, Ohio. The winner plays nationally first-ranked DePaul (28-1) in the quarterfinals of the mideast regional Saturday. In Friday's first semifinal contest, St. Joe's made seven of its first eight shots to streak to a 16-6 lead over Lafayette as the Leopards canned only two of 10 attempts. The Hawks showed their 2,500 fans a superior brand of basketball in increasing their lead to 33-15 at halftime on 64 percent shooting and a 17-10 re bounding edge. Despite hitting 13 more field goals than their op ponents in a second half com eback attempt, the Leopards never got closer than the final margin of 10 points. The Hawks maintained their lead with 26-34 accuracy at the charity stripe while Lafayette went to the line 14 times--hitting only eight--in the foul-filled second half. All-ECCforward Boo Williams of St. Joe's led all scorers with 22 points and had game highs of eight rebounds and three blocked shots. A fast-breaking offense and rapid ball movement enabled American to roll to a 49-37 halftime lead over Rider in the second semifinal as the Eagles hit 65 percent of their shots. Although the Broncs played more cohesively throughout the game than in their sloppily-played quarterfinal victory over the Breakin' Bisons, Rider lacked the depth and stamina to catch American. The Eagles continued their hot shooting from  both the field and the free-throw line to streak to a 19 point win. St. Joe's reeled off six unanswered points to tie the hotly-contested championship game 54-54 when Lonnie McFarlan converted a steal into a driving layup. McFarlan was fouled on the play and his free throw gave the Hawks a 57-54 lead with 2:27 left. American then scored six of the next eight points to retake the lead, 60-59, with :58 left when Sloane made a steal at midcourt and scored on a driving layup. Center Tony Costner scored the game winning points for St. Joe's 17 seconds later with a short bank shot, giving him 23 points for the night. Bryan Warrick sealed the win for St. Joe's with a pair of free throws with two seconds left to give the Hawks a 63-60 margin and a trip to the NCAAs."

"Friday, March 13,1981","By JEFF CROSS MECHANICSBURG -  Climax ing its winningest season ever, the Ice Hockey Club edged Dickinson 2-0 here Tuesday for its seventh straight win and a final 13-3-1 record. By beating the Red Devils twice and tying diem once this year, the Nukes took a com manding 4-2-2 lead over Dickin son in the th ree-y ea r-old Challenge Cup. Goaltender Ron Borcherdt '81 was the key to the victory, turn ing aside 28 Red Devil shots to record his and the Nukes' first shutout of the season. Borcherdt low ered his goals against average to 3.4 goals per game with a variety of dazzling glove and stick saves to silence the 110 vocal Dickinson followers at the Skateium. Jeff Kaighn '83 notched the eventual game - winner with a low, hard slap shot from  the blue line 1:30 into the second period after receiving a breakout pass from Fid Speer '80. Paul Devlin '83 sealed the triumph with four seconds left in the game by scor ing an empty net goal with the Red Devil goaltender benched in favor of an extra skater. As in their 7-3 win over the Red Devils Feb. 27, the Nukes used aggressive forechecking and hard hitting to slow the Dickinson attack. D efensem en D evlin, Chris Rising '83 and Hugh Thornhill '81 made numerous goal-saving clears in front of the Nukes' goal and prevented any wide open Red Devil shots. While being outshot 13-5 in the first period, Bucknell had trouble getting untracked after a 10-day layoff. Nevertheless, Borcherdt was flawless in the nets, making several saves while being screen ed by the congestion in the Bucknell zone. The Nukes' passes started to connect in the second stanza as the action continued fast and furious. On a power play midway through the period, Kaighn and classmates Remi Johnson and Dan Fitzpatrick bombarded the Dickinson cage with numerous scoring chances, but to no avail. The home team held a 10-6 shots on goal advantage for the period. In the final period, Speer, Stalio Boyd '80 and Jeff Cross '82 con tinuously harassed the Dickinson defensemen to create frequent chances, but their shots could not find the mark. Bucknell lost its best chance for an insurance goal when Devlin hit the goal post with six minutes left after skating the length of the ice and faking his way past the Dickinson goalie. Hustling forwards Stu Vaeth '84, Bill Lightfoot '82 and Chuck Zaleski '83 assisted the first two lines in pressuring the Red Devils into making mistakes as time ran down. As they had throughout the game, the Red Devils continued to skate furiously in search of the tying goal. Dickinson gambled by pulling its goaltender with two minutes remaining and managed several solid chances -- but Bor cherdt was equal to the task. Finally, Devlin silenced the partisan crowd with an empty net goal from center ice to set off a wild celebration by the Nukes' net. The Nukes were outshot for on ly the third time in 17 outings, 28-14, but the territorial play was even. Bucknell committed only one penalty--a season low--and the hosts were whistled down but three times in the clean but hard hitting game. The Nukes hit the post once and Dickinson twice. rnoto--Jonn KosenneD"

to student group,"By JAN BALAKIAN The dispute between the members of the Recycling Club and the group's form er ad visor concerning the possession and use of the club's funds raised under his advisor- ship was ended by the University Commit- tee on Complementary Activities Thurs- ^The committee sent a recommendation to University President Dennis O'Brien that the funds currently held in a private bank account of Chairman and Professor of Mechanical Engineering Charles Coder be transferred to the University Student Organization account, with use of the funds to be determined by the current members of the organization. The committee was charged by the ABo Congress Oct. 13 to review the dispute bet ween Coder and the club members and for mulate a recommendation to settle the issue. Coder had refused to let club members use the $4,633 raised under his advisorslup, maintaining that the money was raised with the intention of establishing a scholar ship fund to aid a needy Lewisburg student attending the University. ^ , The present club members asserted that the funds belonged to the club mid the use of the funds should be controlled by the club. After reviewing University policy and documents provided by the Recycling Club, it was determined that no commit ment to any goal had been made, and thus the present membership must determine the funds use. However, the history of in terest in a scholarship was recognized and the committee recommended that this in terest be maintained. "" The Lewisburg residents will feel deceived""  Coder said in response to the Former President of the RecycUng Club Bob Doms '81 said he was pleased with the action, though he said the first priority must still be to expand the recycling both on campus and in town. It was when Doms was the group s presi dent that the funds controversy began. Zeller said "" if a club acts against the ad visor's wishes, then the advisor can resign "" and that the "" continuing membership""  should decide the group s financial goals."

Grant distribution,
questioned by ABS,
congress members,"By SUSAN MACDONALD A proposal to shift the em phasis of the University's finan cial aid Talent Grant Program away from athletics and toward an equal sharing among athletes, academics and the arts was discussed at the ABS Congress meeting Monday. The proposal, drafted by Freshman Class President Dan Huck '84, suggests an equal split of 33 percent of the funds be distributed among the three areas, beginning in the 1983-84 academic year. The current policy concerns 40 percent of the total funds available for financial aid. This percentage is distributed through a Talent Grant Program to students who dem onstrate special abilities. Of these funds, 60 percent is earmarked for athletes -- with the remainder to be decided on a case by case basis, Huck said. In the discussion of the pro posal, Jim Mitchell '83 said "" the proposal doesn't represent the views of the student body."" Trax Dorm Council President Steve Habetz '84 said "" the grant should be distributed in proportion to the number of students involved in the activities."" "" Cutting the Talent Grant Pro gram for athletes from  60 to 33 percent is not practical. We know that will never happen,"" ABS President Michael Suarez '82 said. Suarez suggested freezing the level of funds currently pegged to athletes, and putting the remaining 40 percent of the Talent Grant funds "" to better use."" At the conclusion of the discus sion, Huck was asked to redraft the proposal, taking into con sideration the points raised dur ing the meeting. Director of Ad missions Richard Skelton, Direc tor of Financial Aid Ronald Laszewski and D irector of Athletics Bruce Corrie will be asked to attend the next meeting to offer their comments and ad vice on the proposal."

Panel establishes a press coverage policy,"_ . . t ____ v. Judith Lasker said s By LISA CERUTI The University Committee on Instruction voted Tuesday to permit the press to attend its weekly meetings at the discretion of the chairman of the committee. The decision followed the exclusion of a Bnrfrmdiiaii reporter from  the committee's March 10 meeting and discussion by the com mittee on establishing a policy to address the issue. Committee member and WVBU News Director Todd Buchholz '83 made a motion Tuesday to "" open the meetings at the discre tion of the chairman unless they deal with personnel matters."" According to Committee Chairman and Associate Professor of Religion Joseph LaBarge, the voice vote on the motion was not unanimous but "" the people who voted af firmatively were definitely in the m ajority. Associate Professor of Chemistry John Cooper, who has been acting as secretary of the committee, said the vote was "" just a ma jority""  and refused to comment further. Buchholz said "" the new policy should have some advantages for both students and the committee itself. Hopefully, students will be made aware of committee proposals and the committee will get more reaction froni those who will be affected most by its actions. Committee member and Assistant Pro fessor of Sociology Judith Lasker said she "" believes in freedom of the press"" and sees "" no reason ordinarily to exclude them. Lasker said the com mittee's actions are meant to serve the community and, if people are interested, they should be able to attend meetings. "" It's a rare occasion that we discuss something so sensitive that reporters should be excluded,""  Lasker said. The Committee on Instruction is the only standing committee that has voted on a policy concerning the press' right to attend meetings, according to Provost Wendell Smith. "" I have heard nothing about the mat ter from  any of the other com mittees,""  Smith said."

of the College of Arts and Sciences Robert Chambers listen,
during a meeting of the College of Arts and Sciences faculty,
in the University Center Forum Nov. 4. Chambers chaired the,
faculty meeting in Coleman Hall Thursday and spoke in favor,
of establishing a departmental minor.,"ByBILLTHUM A proposal to establish Departmental Minor Pro grams was unanimously passed by the facultyof the College of Arts and Sciences at its meeting Thurs- (fay The proposal, developed by the Curriculum Com mittee of the college, is intended to achieve a tetter balance between the depth and breadth of educa tional program s, according to Chairman and Pro fessor of History Michael Payne. Payne said motivation for the proposal grew out of interest in the foreign language departments to encourage students to learn a foreign language while m ajoring in a different field. According to the proposal, a balance would also be promoted bet ween a literal and preprofessional education. "" Through the establishment of a structure in determining the requirements for a minor, students will be made aware and encouraged to investigate their interests,""  Payne said. In addition, the minor can diversify a student's education by crossing bet ween the bachelor of arts and bachelor of science degree program s, according to the proposal. One of the m ajor concerns of the faculty during discussion was the possibility of double counting of courses. Associate Professor of Religion William Becker questioned the structuring of the minor pro posal "" on the possible effect of students neglecting the double m ajor and instead settling on a minor."" This would lead to a shrinking of the students depth of interest and educational experience in stead of expanding through use of the minors, B1?aynesaid, "" the committee had decided that the University had an obligation to develop the minor to encourage student program s and interests to be followed beyond the requirements for m ajors and degree distributions."" , , _ . Professor of Religion and Political Science Douglas Sturm questioned the possible conflicts the proposal would have on the work of the Special Committee on Curricular Reform  which was form ed to debate the issue of changes in distributional requirements in the degree programs. Dean of the College Robert Chambers said the proposal would pose no problem and had already received the com mittee's recommendation. The regulations regarding the departmental minor stipulate a load of four, five or six courses in each department. Once proposed and approved by the college's curriculum committee, the minor can only be changed in the same manner as departmen tal m ajors. Changes will not be approved for in dividual students, although the departments may include options for their minors within this pro-"
grain.,"The program will begin immediately, with pro posals to be made to the Curriculum Committee."
Area anti-nuclear group,
to stage a demonstration,"By ANNE PAVUK A protest against nuclear energy sponsored by the Buffalo Valley Chapter of the Susquehanna Alliance -- an organization opposed to the planned operation of Pennsylvania Power and Light's nuclear power plant near Berwick -- is scheduled from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Saturday in front of the United States Post Office on 3rd and Market Streets. The ""vigil"" has been organized as a protest in recognition of the sec ond anniversary of the accident at Three Mile Island on March 28, 1979. The Buffalo Valley Chapter is a branch of the Susquehanna Alliance, an organization formed in 1976 which includes members from throughout eastern Pennsylvania. The local group, consisting of ap proximately 20 active members, originated in 1979. According to Mary Ostrander, a member of the local chapter, the vigil will include the distribution of leaflets on nuclear energy, the demonstration of members carrying signs and hourly showings of ""Harrisburg,"" a movie depecting people's reactions to the accident at Three Mile Island. Ostrander said the Buffalo Valley Chapter attempts to educate the public through public speakers, film series and letters to the editors of local papers.. ""We are striving to make people aware of not just the hazards of nuclear energy but also of viable alternatives,"" she said. The group discussed plans for the upcoming protest and organized a ""letter writing campaign"" during its March 12 meeting held at SA of fices at 424% Market Street, according to Tony Sade, a member of the organization. David Mann, another member, said the Buffalo Valley Chapter has been concentrating its anti-nuclear energy campaign on the Berwick plant because there is no organized chapter there. Mann said there has not yet been any ""active opposition"" in Berwick and the benefits of increased employment opportunities provided by the plant have ""allayed the fears"" of area residents. Of the two Berwick power plant units under construction, one is 90 percent completed and the other 50 percent completed, according to Mann. He said the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has already been petitioned for operating licenses and -- if the licenses are granted -- the first unit will begin operating in June 1983. Mann said that although there are few University students involved in the Buffalo Valley Chapter, the organization has been working with the Bucknell Progressive Caucus in planning the ""Energy Fair '81"" scheduled for Sunday, Monday and Tuesday and sponsored by the"

Committee imposes sanctions,
on student guilty of violations,"By ANDREW D. MARSH A student found guilty by local and University authorities of discharging a fire extinguisher in a residence hall has been ordered to exclude himself from all nonacademic - related activities on cam pus. The Committee on Student Conduct imposed the sanction on David Brond after finding him guilty March 7 of six violations of the University Regula tions Relating to Conduct. ""His actions were a flagrant violation of the University's standards and expectations,"" Commit tee Chairman and Associate Professor of Political Science Tom Travis said. Six punishments handed down by the committee were put into effect Wednesday, ranging from a pro hibition from living or eating in any University or fraternity housing -- Brond had lived at the Delta Upsilon fraternity house -- to a prohibition against his attending all social events here, from fraternity parties to the pre-graduation ""tent party."" The 21-year-old senior will be immediately dismissed from Bucknell and denied his degree if he fails to comply with the punishments, Travis said. The last time a student disciplinary case was heard to completion by the Committee on Student Conduct was 1977, when one student was placed on probation for harassing two others, according to Assistant Dean of Student Affairs Joseph Mam- mola. Brond was convicted of discharging a fire ex tinguisher in the formal living room of Vedder Hall Dec. 6 during a party 50 members of Delta Phi Ep silon sorority were having to commemorate the chartering of the former Delta Lambda Pi chapter here as a part of the national organization. According to Travis, more than $700 in damage was done to the carpeted and expensively upholstered room, which contains Colonial fur niture and a grand piano. Mammola and Campus Security were immediate ly summoned to the scene following the incident, at which time Brond was identified and apprehended. Many of the people attending the party experienced respiratory congestion, headaches and abdominal cramps for a few days following the incident which they attributed to exposure to the fire extinquisher's chemical powder emission, according to testimony at the committee's hearing. Acting Chief of Security Michael Amarante cited Brond for criminal mischief for firing the ex tinguisher, and he (Brond) later pleaded guilty before District Magistrate Leo Armbruster. He was fined a total of $56 by the borough and was also ordered to pay DPE President Katharyn Olson '81 $35 for replacement and cleaning of the belongings of some DPE members. DPE filed the charges against Brond for viola tions of Bucknell's conduct code. During the hearing before the committee -- composed of two ad ministrators, five students and three faculty members -- Brond maintained he was not intox icated during the incident and that his actions were spontaneous. Travis said Brond has chosen not to appeal and, when contacted by the Bucknellian this week, Brond said he had ""no comment"" except a pledge that he ""will be complying with the restrictions."" Travis said that ""the committee seriously con sidered suspending the student from the University, but instead chose to impose severe disciplinary pro bation."" ---------------"

BAAA holds apartheid colloquium;,
Sullivan Principles called ineffective,"ByM.E. WEIL The Sullivan Principles -- a "" code of corporate conduct"" that calls for improved lixing and work conditions for South African blacks -- are ineffec tive in lessening discrimination in a system where there is apartheid, sociologist David Massey said here Tuesday. Massey, speaking during a two-day colloquium sponsored by the Bucknell Alliance Against Apar theid, spoke against the very principles that are a key element in the University's tentative plan for selective divestiture of its holdings in companies with subsidiaries in South Africa. As part of the colloquium, the BAAA, which is ac tively seeking total divestiture of University stock, is circulating a petition proposing that the Universi ty eliminate "" corporations with direct or indirect investments in South Africa and banks of lending in stitutions extending loans to the government of South Africa""  from its investment portfolio. Divestiture "" undermines the morality of whites in South Africa"" according to Wandile Kuse of the University of Illinois, who spoke on the historical perspectives of South Africa Tuesday night in the Olin Science Auditorium. The colloquium -- entitled "" South Africa: Can it be Defused""  -- also included Assistant Professor Barbara Brown of Mount Holyoke College, who spoke on "" Women Under Apartheid"" Monday. Brown said President Reagan does not support United Slates divestiture of American corporations. She quoted Reagan as saying that South Africa is a "" friend"" of the United States and "" we should deal with them as a friendly nation."" According to BAAA co-coordinator Masato Aoko '82, the colloquium was intended to "" bring the apar theid issue to the attention of the University com munity. We want to get people interested, concern ed and at least better informed,"" he said. Carolyn Berner '81, the other eo-coordinator of the group, said the University has more than $4.5 million invested in corporations affiliated with South Africa. According to Berner, the Sullivan Principles are not specific enough to provide an effective solution to the problem of apartheid. In addition to the three lectures, the movies "" Last Grave at Dimbaza""  and "" There is no Crisis"" we're shown Monday and Tuesday nights in the Olin Science Auditorium. Photo--Matt Karanian"

Progressive Caucus cancels an ROTCprotest rally,"Dear President O'Brien: It has com e to the attention of the members of the Bucknell Progressive Caucus that the local ROTC unit plans to engage In war games that will originate here, on campus, certainly with the use of trucks and possibly with helicopters on March 21 and April 10, 1161. For many years, a large number of individuals and groups have argued against and demonstrated against the presence of the ROTC at Bucknell, though perhaps not during your term as president. The argument has always been the same one: there Is no place at an institution of learning for a military organisation, the structure of which Is based on command and a total lack of freedom of thought or action and the end of which is to prepare for killing. The humane values of free Inquiry and challenge, curiosity, and the shaking loose from received opinions that Bucknell must profess to stand for as a university are entirely negated by the rigid authoritarianism of the m ilitary. Furthermore, the most decent im pulses of men -- to live In harmony with one's neighbor, to turn the other cheek, to reach out a helping hand rather than to thrust a fist -- values, again, that a true university must support, are affronted by bayonnets and helicopter blades. Therefore, we ask to have a meeting with you as soon as possible in which we can discuss stopping this planned ROTC "" exercise""  and In which we can raise the larger Issues of why Bucknell is the host to a regional collection of college ROTCs and why Bucknell has an ROTC unit on its campus. Our letter comes late, does not give you much time to respond, but that Is because the Army Is not an open Institution; it does not adver tise its plans In advance, there Is no ROTC syllabus for playing killing games. Should you not be able to persuade the ROTC to stop their maneuvers or to meet with us beforehand, rest assured that the Bucknell Progressive Caucus will make Its own presence known on March 21 and April 10.

Congress approves a proposal,
for an increase in coed dorms,"By SUSAN MACDONALD The Association of Bucknell Students passed a petition Mon day asking the Office of Residen tial Life for two additional coed floors to be included in this spring's room selection. The action followed a task force report by ABS Vice President Missy Campbell '82 on student housing. The report specifically dealt with coed dorms because of the "" positive response of students to the coed system,""  Campbell said. In an interview with Campbell, Director of Residential Life Bren da Gordon said that -- although the office is not barraged by students requesting coed dorms -- the students currently living on them seem to think they provide a "" good experience,"" according to the vice president. "" Contrary to popular thought, the coed situation fosters a 'fami ly' atmosphere with relationships between students not unlike brothers and sisters,""  she said. Although no dorm was specified in the ABS petition, Gordon said that physically, Swartz lends itself better to coed housing -- particularly New Swartz, with its common lounges. The congress settled on two coed halls in its petition in reac tion to Campbell's report of Gor don's statement that the demand did not warrant a large increase in the number of coed halls, Campbell said. Campbell also reported on the possibility of establishing coed halls in the Freshman Quad. Although the Office of Residen tial Life does not consider this feasible for the next school year, Campbell reported that it could be considered in the future."
ABS scholarship debate dates to 1969,"Debate on the ABS Scholarship--which last week saw the ABS Congress redirect its funds from  one for minorities to one explicitly for leaders-- originated more than ten years ago, when the congress debated whether to even provide the scholarship. According to a report in the Oct. 24, 1969 Bucknellian, the theme "" diversify""  was "" running through""  the ABS meeting that week, upon a presentation by the Congress' Admissions Commit tee. It was planned for an "" Ad Hoc Committee on Dif ferently Prepared Students"" to be chosen at the meeting, but the choice of members "" was tabled"" till a later date. The Rnf>>kneiHan also reported that "" The commit tee was boycotted by the Association of Blacks for Progress because a similar committee, submitting a report calling for recruitment and admission of more blacks, was not considered because some felt that its student membership was unrepresentative of the community."" The report concluded that "" all present agreed that the m ajor aim of the committee should be recruitment and admission of a more diverse stu dent body."" According to the Nov. 4, 1969 Bucknellian, students interested in the "" Ad Hoc Committee for studying the University's resources for differently prepared students, with special emphasis on the black problem ,""  were asked to attend that even ing's ABS meeting. More than one year later, on Dec. 8,1970, the ABS endorsed a plan to increase the student activities fee by $5 in order to fund a student scholarship for "" differently prepared""  students."
Redirection o f scholarship is discussed,"From REDIRECTION, page 1. fund of $15,000--was originally simply a "" gesture of protest,"" designed to encourage "" diversi ty""  here, but not necessarily "" minorities.""  The scholarship was originally worded as directed for "" differently prepared""  persons. Associate Professor of English Richard Smith, who was also in attendance at the meeting, said Suarez was playing a "" linguistic shell gam e""  by asserting that "" diversity""  did not imply the in clusion of black students, and that "" differently prepared""  per sons were not minorities. He said this interpretation of the original interest of the scholarship was "" not accurate."" Dean of Student Affairs John Dunlop called it a "" historic acci dent""  that blacks came to be identified as "" differently prepared""  students. The proposed redirection of the ABS scholarship would result in no change in the amount of aid black students would receive, and there would be "" no change for anybody""  as a result of the redirection, according to Suarez. He said aid to black students was "" already protected by the University""  and that it shouldn't be necessary for the ABS scholar ship to continue to encourage minority enrollment. Suarez add ed that a redirection of the funds would not hurt the black com munity, but would instead specifically "" foster leadership."" The conditions of the revised"
ABS,"scholarship--which was unanimously endorsed by the ABS Congress March 10--calls for the student to exhibit genuine "" financial need""  and also the "" potential"" for leadership, Suarez said. It does not make any further restrictions on its rece- pients, nor does it give preference to students in any other categories, he added. Smith said it was "" un fortunate""  the ABS had taken this position "" given the current mood of the country.""

The Enquirer's lawyers argue that the publication acted within the First Amendment of the Con stitution and that, if Burnett wins, the decision could limit the ability of all publications to report on public figures."

Vandalism causes,
removal of statue,"Repeated incidents of van dalism  have cau sed the Lewisburg Borough to remove the six-foot tall copper statue from the Civil War monument at University Avenue, S. 3rd and St. George Streets. Alfred S. Hause, director of the County Department of Veteran Affairs, who assisted with the removal of the statue Monday, said it would be stored temporari- ly in the Union County Courthouse. The statue, valued at $800, was pulled down to a 45-degree angle with the monument sometime last Friday or Saturday."

Jenks and Mahon run for council seats,"Two University faculty members this week announced their can didacies for seats on the Lewisburg borough Council. University Librarian George Jenks will face Democratic incum bent J. David Maier in the spring primary for the Ward 1 slot on the council. The 51-year-old former employee of the CIA -- who has run the Ellen Clark Bertrand Library since 1969 -- said he decided to seek a seat on the council because he views it as a public service and wants to participate in the town's operation. Owen Mahon, a lecturer in the Department of Management, is seeking re-election as a Republican to the four-year term oi coun cilman in Ward 2. Mahon, 51, has taught here for 10 years and is also owner of The Open Door Art Shop on Market Street Fair '81"" Sunday, Monday and Tuesday.

EDITORIALS,
Figures of speech,
The perceptions of the college journalist is an unfortunately two-,
sided one. When the news in our limited field of vision is less than,
what some think -- or perhaps hope -- is scintillating -- we are told,
"our reporting is as ''exciting as a mortician's speech.""  But when a",
"flame of controversy -- even a flicker, actually -- is lit, we are con",
demned for sensationalizing and even editorializing the news.,
Look under your Time and New York Times to find last week's,
Bucknellian; it's a prime example. Stories dealing with such sen,
sitive issues as the impending dismissal of one of the University's,
top administrators and a potential shift in scholarship monies away,
from the purses of minorities were covered without a pause. But,
"within hours of the news' arriving in the University Center, the cam",
pus press was called to task for presenting truths far deeper than,
"those which appear in our ''Coming Events"" column on page two.",
Despite the nervous pondering of the campus politicians and the,
shrouding of the administration's actions behind a wall of at least,
""" off-the-record"" secrecy, reevaluations of actions taken by both the",
president of the ABS and the president of the University were taking,
"place. By today, progress has been made (and once again reported)",
on both the ABS Scholarship story and the John Ferguson resigna,
tion story -- two issues that effect all readers and their educations.,
Are these the sequences of events readers consider dry and,
about which the Bucknellian is usually recalcitrant? We certainly,
don't think so.,
Finally,
It's a good feeling to know that -- after nearly four months of,
waiting and wishing -- the Bucknell Recycling Club will finally be,
getting back the money owed them by Charles Coder.,
The principal of a student organization having free and,
unobstructed access to its own financial principal is one too great to,
"let slip through the fingers of bureaucratic stalling. But, hard as",
John Dunlop and one or two others have been trying since the fall to,
"reach yesterday's conclusion, their attempts have been foiled by a",
much larger number -- the membership of the Complimentary Ac,
tivities Committee.,
Too bad; they should have jumped 18 weeks ago to get Bob Dorns,
and Co. their restitution.,
Minor matters?,
It used to be that all students unquestioningly picked their,
favorite subject as their major halfway through their college career,
"and that was that. But that -- as the song goes -- "" was a long, long",
"time ago.""  The double-major evolved for those who couldn't decide",
between neutrons and Nitzsche; then came the interdepartmental,
"major for those torn between and among a number of departments,",
and then m erged the college major for those who couldn't decide at,
all.,
This curricular option evolution shifted into a minor gear Thurs-,
- day when the College of Arts and Sciences passed a proposal calling,
for departmental minors. While at first blush this sounds like a fine,
"idea, we wondered after a fashion if it is really necessary.",
The ability to pursue a minor could encourage a better balance,
for a student like the one alluded to above -- the type that is pre-,
professional but still harbors a yen for the liberal arts. This option,
could allow them just the flexibility their intellects need to achieve,
true command of their academic potential.,
But while looking at this new program might lead us to believe it,
could have nothing but beneficial effects on the student body of the,
"college, perhaps we might observe that these minors might also be",
seen as placebos. Nothing now prohibits students from taking as,
"many courses as they like outside their major. What, then, is the",
term minor other than another line on the transcript -- a handy and,
perhaps impressive label to be tacked on the resume.,
We can only hope the benevolent intentions of the sponsors of the,
college's plan are more on the minds of the students than the all-too,
often panic at the thought of completing that resume.,

In the last issue of the Bucknellian there was an article discuss ing the ABS' redirection of scholarships to leaders instead of to minorities. The statement implied that minority students are not leaders This accusation stems from blatant racism which sup- wm respond:
U .,"misunderstanding."" I am tired of misunderstandings-. The Financial Aid Office is also discussing financial aid cuts. Both agencies are well aware that the cuts will directly affect the percentage of black students attending Bucknell. However, I do not believe they are concerned.

Cynical reprimand,
requires more facts,"TotheEditor: , , ,, We truly regret that Marty Welland, the resident assistant and leader of Hulley House, neglected to research the facts behind the Creative Arts Association ap propriation before he launched a tirade against the ABS. Weiland was nearly ac curate when he reported that $350 was re quested of the ABS Appropriations Com mittee (the number was actually $355) for Hulley House. However, $300 of this was for an art show and a folk festival, both of which are one-time, all-campus events that come under the fiscal jurisdiction of the Committee on Student Programs, not the ABS Appropriations Committee. In addition, we regret Weiland's error concerning poster board allocations, they received all that was asked for. In fairness to the Rifle Club, we would also like to point out that they received $1,282 from the ABS, not Weiland's $600 figure. In the future, our hope is that Weiland, as head of the Creative Arts House, will become better informed before writing cynical reprimands. The ABS Appropria tions Committee is more than willing to support the Arts and Hulley House, but we are not ready to accept uninformed criticism for adhering to our guidelines.

This argument, put in terms somewhat more comprehensible to the scientific mind, runs simp ly thus: they have offered a con clusion without stating the equa tion whereby that conclusion was derived and therefore have rendered said conclusion mean ingless. Unfortunately, this type of flawed logic is all too common.

The Catechist: enlightening the student body with propagan a,". . t oaa onv nppd or an\ TotheEditor: , , After reading it, I feel I must protest the Bucknell Progressive Caucus' new paper, The Catechist. I don't deny Bucknell students are largely unaware of the world situation. However, The Catechist, instead of trying to enlighten the student body, shoves highly opinionated propaganda at it. The Catechist admits to being opinionated, but claims it's also informative. When something wants to really inform however, it presents both sides of an issue rnstead, The Catechist throws us one-sided information, and tells us this is how we think, and you re a fool if you think otherwise. I don't know about you, but I like to draw my own conclusions. Two more points I'd like to bring up concern the article ""Bucknell Women: Survey Revelations."" This article brought a lot of laughter to my hall. If as is stated, the survey was conducted by ""a man-hating, perverted radical,"" why was it printed? Also, talkuig about birth control is fine but let them inform the student body, not just spout figures. Another point: I see no reason for using obscene language in a newspaper. That s just sensationalism. I don't see any need or any place for that type of thing in responsible journalism. I believe that if The Catechist wants to gain respect, it should shape up its act. On the first page, it calls the New York Times and Newsweek mediocre publications. I'd say this is like the pot calling the kettle black, but The Catechist has a long way to go before it reaches mediocrity. Cameron Weston '84 March 18,1981"

Florida: just skin off your back,
By Todd G. Buchholz,"Have you Florida-bound vaca tioning Bucknellians started parking yet? Before folding the last pair of socks and looking for the blow-dryer, maybe you should reconsider. After all, there must be at least 10 reasons not to visit Florida. Non-vacationers, you too can read these; maybe they will make you feel better about stay ing in Yankee country: (1) . It always rains when Nor therners go South. This maxim is as reliable as a cafeteria line at lunch. Ask anybody who has been to Florida. You can listen to the forecasts every hour on the radio, but no matter what Com- puweather says, when you visit, the clouds will burst! Sorry, but an umbrella is as basic to a visitor as a calculator is to an engineer. (2) . The sun will shine and bake you like a casserole in a microwave oven, despite the precautions and the Sea & Ski commercials. And you'll be so repulsed by peeling skin and raw pink flesh that turtlenecks and long sleeves will be stylish for spring formals this year. (3) 7There are just too many old people in Florida. Every Nor- theasterner who has retired in the last 30 years has purchased a condominium in Florida, most of them across the street from where you'll be staying in Ft. Lauderdale. Not only that, they which loves to fine youngsters for disturbing the peace. So remember: lights out and stereos off at 8:30 p.m. -- you'll need lots of sleep to be in shape for the shuffleboard tournament at 8:30 the next morning. (4). All those tacky college kids from state schools will already be"
THE,
BUCH,
STOP,"there. Who wants to associate with people who had low SAT scores anyway? (5) . Like saccharine, red dye #2, coffee and saliva, the good old sun causes cancer in laboratory rats who live in Canada, drink 800 bottles of diet soda daily and work in nuclear plants. Everyone knows we're subjected to enough g a m m a  r a y s , X - r a y s , microwaves and goodbye waves already. You're really asking for trouble by sitting outside for a week. (6) . Twenty-four hours in a car is just absurd. Even the best deodorants claim only 18 hours of protection, and driving for that inns with the same people will bring forth the frightening con clusion that you've run out of things to talk about after 20 years of life. At least math majors and engineers can do equations on the way down, but the rest of you will have to settle for "" Turn up the tunes, dudes."" (7) . A quick three-hour plane trip is equally as absurd. Any 5th grade graduate will tell you plane rides aren't fun because you can't see any of the tourist sights. The boring parts of the Carolinas and Jimmy's home state deserve more attention than a wave from 30,000 feet; a trek down south is wasteful without being stopped by a speed trap in Plains, Ga. (8) . Sharon the cafeteria lady claims Florida is just like Penn sylvania -- once you've seen one town you've seem them all. If you can't trust the lady who makes the egg salad and who spent three weeks there in January, who can you trust? (9) . When you return, students you've never seen before will ac cost you, stare at your charred flesh, shake your shoulders and ask that insipid question: "" Where have you been, Florida?"" Avoiding this inquiry is worth staying home, even if you live in Hoboken. (10) . If any of these tragedies should strike, I'll have to devote an entire column to "" I told you so.""

OPINIONS,
Page 11,
By Howard Manly,
and Kevin A. Parker,"ATLANTA -- We remember 17 years ago when Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. marched from Montgomery to Selma to demonstrate his outrage over the bomb ings of Negro churches. We remember the harassment of hate-filled policemen, toe unequal treatment of blacks in toe courts of law and toe chills that spread through our heads when we listened to him preach about having a dream of freedom for all oppressed people. And then he was shot. In this city where he was buried, 20 black children have been killed. The causes of death varied: seven were by strangula tion, three by asphyxiation, six by undeter mined causes, two by beatings with an ob ject, one by a gunshot and one by stabbing. Three more were reported missing this past weekend. Two fathers of toe victims have suffered heart attacks; one mother has had a ner vous breakdown, and 15 siblings and four mothers of toe dead youths have been under psychiatric care. The children of Atlanta have been held hostage by a killer without a face or a name. We walked in toe ghettos here last weekend in 70-degree weather looking for little children playing in toe streets. Tne playgrounds and toe streets were empty. We looked further, and saw five little boys and girls sitting on a front porch undertoe careful watch of their guardian. The children were greeted by two young boys, both of whom were carrying pointed stakes. Later we heard on toe radio that another child was reported missing. Edward Smith -- was found in July 1979. Since then, millions of dollars have been raised by toe government, Sammy Davis, Jr Frank Sinatra and private donations to help pay for toe costly search for toe killer(s). Without any concrete evidence, toe police and toe public can only speculate about toe cause of toe killings. Some say it's toe Ku Klux Klan, some say it's a con- spiracy within the Atlanta police that reaches to toe White House, and some say it's toe fault of toe parents for living in ghettos. All remain in toe dark. Speculation generates hysteria and hysteria never solved any murders. What is at toe bottom of this tragedy is a failure of our government to protect people from being killed in toe streets of American cities. New York and toe Freeway Phantom murders of little black girls in Washington, D.C. Neither has fostered as much racial tension as toe little children in Atlanta. Before we start wearing green ribbons or making donations, let's remember our little brothers and sisters and hope they are safe. Let's hope that toe killings will stop before any more of our children become statistics. With our law - enforce ment agencies in their present ineffective state, hope is our only recourse. Will trust ever be restored in our society, or will these inhumane actions afflict toe entire nation for toe rest of our existence? How many more will have to die? The body of toe first child -  14-year-old We remember toe Son of Sam^kUUngs to Howard Manly is a senior international rela tions major from Potomac, M d., and Kevin A. Parker is a biology and English major from Baltimore. Both attended the rally in Atlanta Saturday and w ere sponsored by the ABS Congress."

"Popular singer Pat Benatar performs in Ocean City,",
Maryland last July. Benatar and Bob Dylan are currently,
under consideration for concerts here.,
BCC takes initial steps,
"to book Benatar, Dylan","By ALLISON ABOUCHAR The Bucknell Concert Committee has recently approached Pat Benatar and Bob Dylan with bids for concerts here, the Bucknellian learned tills W 66k. Because Benatar will be giving large concerts in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh during her September tour and other schools may be placing higher bids, Assistant Concert Committee Chairman Rich Schaberg '81 said the group is ""not very hopeful"" that Benatar will accept the BCC's offer of $30,500 for a one-night concert either Sept. 9 or 16. But Schaberg said he hopes the decision will be finalized ""before the end of the semester."" A second bid -- for a concert by Bob Dylan -- has been approv ed by University officials and is currently under consideration by Monarch Entertainment, Dylan's agent, Schaberg said. Dylan'r plans for a tour may be cancelled, however, according to Schaberg Benatar, one of the hottest new artists this past year, has released two albums. In The Heat of the Night was released in September 1979 and included the hit single ""Heartbreaker."" Her most recent album, released last year, was entitled Crimes of Passion and included the popular ""Hit Me With Your Best Shot."" Dylan, a legend of the 1960s, has recently begun writing Chris tian music. His latest album, entitled Slow Train Coming, was released in 1979. Every concert considered by the Bucknell Concert Committee must first be approved by the Steering Committee of the ABS and members of the administration -- including Vice President for Ad ministration and Finance John Zeller, Dean of Student Affairs John Dunlop and Director of Student Activities and University Center Programs James Hammerlee. A bid is presented through an agency -- in this case Monarch Entertainment of West Orange, N. J. works for both artists -- to the artist, who then considers the offer in light of such factors as the touring schedule and the size of the bid, Schaberg said."
Perseverance and enthusiasm provide an enjoyable show,"By LAURA CARMELICH In the not-too-distant past, the Bucknell Dance Company performed its semi-annual shows in the Dance Studio of the Sports/Recreation Complex. Though talented and enthusiastic, the dancers were hindered by the studio's unprofessional conditions of noisy folding chairs and sharply-limited floor space. The company was determined to overcome these hindrances, and their perseverance has paid off. In a show entitled ""Dance On Broadway,"" the Dance Company performed for an overflowing crowd in Coleman Theatre Wednesday. Aside from a few minor technical difficulties, the company was at its very best: competent, self-assured and, at last, professional. The show consisted of 11 numbers, featuring familiar musical pieces from such ballets and shows as ""Swan Lake"" and ""West Side Story."" The opening number, choreographed to ""The Show Must Go On"" by Three Dog Night, featured four dancers in clown costumes. This number, suf fering from the different dancing styles of the four members and their somewhat disjointed timing, was an unfortunate choice for an opener. The show was quickly revived, however, with a beautiful ballet choreographed by Leslie Gallagher '81. A ""Pas de Deux"" was performed nearly flawless ly by Gallagher and Ayumi Hashimoto '81 to the music of ""Swan Lake."" In ""Dance of the Little Swans""--another from ""Swan Lake""--Alison Cor- vington '81 and Cynthia Karbowski '81 joined Gallagher and Hashimoto in an impressively syn chronous ballet adapted by Corvington. Also notable in the first half was a solo per formance by Charlotte Tsuyuki '84 in ""The Music, The Mirror"" from the Broadway hit, ""A Chorus Line."" Tsuyuki's dancing is of an unusually rugged nature which, complemented by her fitting facial expressions, gave this number a realistic and ear thy quality. Two numbers highlighted the superior second half. The first was choreographed by Bucknell dance instructor Joan Clark to the tune ""On Broad way"" by George Benson. In their first per formances of the evening, the dancing of sophomores Marlene Rinder and Julie Scandura ex celled among the superior performances of the rest of the company in this number. The second highlight--and probably the most popular number of the evening--was a tap dance performed by Lisa Cinelli '82 and Dwayne McAliley '83. To the upbeat tune of ""It's All For The Best"" from ""Godspell,"" the couple gave their professionally ar ranged dance a brilliantly executed performance. Adding to the audience's entertainment was the ob vious pleasure the two had in performing this number. Their animated expressions and brisk movements made this dance truly fun to watch. The hard work and enthusiasm of the Bucknell Dance Company have not gone unnoticed. The dancers were unquestionably deserving of their more respectable and wholly more elegant surroun dings. The members should be heartily applauded Photos-- Landes KosenDerry"

"$100,000 gift given for poet-in-residence program","By LYNNE RUTHERFORD In one of the largest private gifts ever donated in support of poetry, an anonymous benefactor has given $100,000 to the University for the creation of a poet - in - residence program. University President Dennis O'Brien made the announcement at Saturday even ing's Association for the Arts Dinner in Larison Dining Hall. The dinner highlighted the final day of a Week's worth of Celebration of the Arts events here. As the new program presently stands, a poet of ""national stature"" will come to die campus for approximately six weeks of the year, holding readings and conducting workshops, seminars and classes. The selection process is now being undertaken for next year by a committee comprised of faculty, administrators and alumni. The residency will be funded annually out of investment earnings from the gift. In other banquet activities, Lecturer in Music Robert Beckman and Edward Davis, senior partner in Theatre Now, a New York firm, were presented with awards. Beckman was honored with the ""Contribution to Music"" award for countless years as a flutist in Cap and Dag ger pit orchestras. He is still active as a part-time instructor here. Davis, who retained his connections with the University by sponsoring a January in ternship with his firm, was commended for ''contributions to the American theater."" Another star of the evening was un doubtedly Grace Good Hettinger, a 1917 graduate and the first woman in history allowed to appear on stage in a Cap and Dagger production. Other speeches were kept short, but Het tinger -- in her tribute to Cap and Dagger -- charmed the audience for 15 minutes with tales of early University life and theater. When she had finished, Director of the University Theater, Harvey Powers, step ped up to the microphone and said, ""I was going to tell you about Cap and Dagger, but Grace covered it all."" Associate Professor of English Ralph Rees, Vice President of the Association for the Arts and Chairman of the Celebration '81 program committee, termed this past week ""the most successful Celebration we've ever had."" ""About 50 percent of the audience during the Rampai concert were students and 75 percent were students during the Houseman lecture. That's what's most im portant -- getting the students to come to the events,"" he said. Next year's Celebration of the Arts Week will center on the University's Chorale, and its long-time director, Professor of Music Allen Flock. A reunion of past and present members of the organization is scheduled to takeplace.' - - * # * # * * * #"

Tristram editors explain poetry and,
prose selection to set record straight,"By AMY KENNEDY Tristram, Bucknell's student literary and art magazine, has often been called pseudo - intellec tual or esoteric. Co-editors Linda Wolff '81 and Howard Rubenstein '81 feel such criticism i~ un founded, however, and this week made clea. the magazine's selection process in an effort to set the record straight. Each piece, Wolff says, is critically analyzed and judged, not only for its potential quality, but also on the skill of the winters within their chosen medium, be it poetry or prose. "" We do not want to sacrifice quality just to get sample selection of the submissions,"" Wolff said. "" We are only as good as what we print."" Both editors said the limited number of prose, poetry and artwork received for consideration is directly related to the small number of creative writing courses offered by Bucknell. Simply put, the selection process runs something like this: the literary editors read the works submit ted and place them on reserve in the Ellen Clarke Bertrand Library, where any interested student may review them. Staff members are required to have read all the literature in order to participate in the final selection. This semester, the editors have added Anne McIn tyre '82 as assistant editor. Other department editors include Debra Sauerland '81, poetry; Ed ward Wise '81, prose, and Derek Gibson '82 and Bar bara Posner '82, art. Lisa DiNicola '81 serves as business manager. As the publication is dependent solely on its ap propriations, the Tristram staff works closely with the ABS. The Mifflinburg Telegraph Co. publishes 1500 copies of the magazine each semester which are distributed free of charge to the University com munity. Tristram will be sponsoring a student art show later this spring in association with Hulley House, as well as the traditional post-publication poetry reading. The Alice J. Russo Memorial Prize of $50 will be awarded to the best poem appearing in this spring's issue."
GLORIA OPENS TONIGHT,"--  Gena Rowlands, as Gloria, protects Phil Dawn, played by John Adam es, from hit men and a nosy police officer in ""G loria."" The drama plays to night through Monday at the Campus Theater, with shows at 7 and 9:10 p.m."
Theater's history and future discussed by Houseman,"By BRUCE BOWEN One of the final events of this year's Celebration of the Arts was a tribute to the 80th anniversary of Cap and Dagger, spearheaded by a lecture by John Houseman. During his introduction of Houseman, Associate Professor of English Ralph Rees told the Rooke Chapel audience of almost 850 that in honor of Cap and Dagger, the coordinators had looked for the "" best available actor""  to start the birthday celebration. Many would not dispute that Houseman is indeed "" the best in American theater,""  Rees said. Houseman's slow, deliberate stroll to the podium sparked memories in a good por tion of the crowd of his famous per formance as Professor Kingsfield in the movie, "" The Paper Chase."" Clad in a grey suit and his traditional bow tie, Houseman charmed the audience from the start with a combination of serious and humorous anecdotes. Houseman's lecture -- entitled "" My Seven Theaters""  -- embodied his view of the history and the future of the theater, especially in America. He said Americans tend to regard the theater as "" entertaining and relaxing,"" rather than in a more serious light. However, he spoke rather highly of AmericalP theater, which he said has its own special style. Calling the theater "" the highest form of human culture,"" Houseman expressed concern about the future of theater and the threat of movies and television, but he con tended that there is "" no substitute for liv-t ing theater."" "" In the past one could at most see one play every two or three weeks. Now, we can watch almost anything anytime we like,"" Houseman said. He continued that television's biggest fault is that quality has become secondary to popularity. His television series "" The Paper Chase""  is a perfect example of this because ratings killed it, according to Houseman. ""  'The Paper Chase' was taken off the air because only 18 million people watched it instead of 30 million. Quality had nothing to do with it,""  he said. The results of this trend, he continued, are "" very nefarious and dangerous,""  as they lead to "" total confusion between quality and quantity.""  He continued that this problem has "" permeated all of socie ty,""  including publishers and museums. "" There is a terribly irresistible urge to follow the winner,""  Houseman said. Houseman said that proof quality is still important may be found in regional theater. "" Regional theater is exempt simply because it cannot exploit the numbers game,"" Houseman said. * *  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *"

After the evening's per formance of "" Our Town, more than 150 past and present Cap and D agger m em bers gathered onstage to celebrate the organization's 80th anniversary. After "" Our Town""  Director Allen Haines '81 and Stage Manager Bruce Delaplane '82 wheeled out a giant birthday cake, 11 of Powers' students took tee stage and began to roast the guest of honor. . . . A s s e m b l e d b e h in d a photograph of Powers with a crown on his head, the panel comprised of Powers' son Marc Powers '72, Vicki Juditz '79, Jon Krause '80, Christopher Laubach '80, Kathi Breitenfeld '80, Richard Schmener '73, Dick Humphries '74, Jane Brown Mass '53, Edward Davis '53, Carey Eidel '79, and Cap and Dagger president Dodie Ripppn 82 proceeded to barb their mentor Dean Martin style. Master of ceremonies Dowme Shanks, a University alumni and non-professional comedian, kept the evening flowing smoothly with jokes and introduced tee panel one by one as they stepped up to the microphone. Former and present actors all, none had lost any chutzpah since graduation, as each in turn sent tee audience into hysterics. Rip^ pon recounted a tale of Powers entire theater history class fall ing asleep, while Humphries and Laubach "" thanked""  Powers for never casting teem  in plays and credited him with having turned teem  away from  acting and into writing and directing. Davis -- senior partner in Theatre Now, a New York firm  - drew tee greatest applause when he presented Powers with a plaque inscribed "" for 32 faithful years of histrionics."" Also in recognition of Powers 32 years of service, University President Dennis O'Brien an nounced at tee Association for the Arts dinner that a bronze plaque will be placed at tee entrance of Coleman Theatre commending Powers. But as if tee standing ovations following this announcement were not enough, Powers was also presented with a silver bowl from  tee Association of the Arts at tee dinner. This bowl was in recognition of Powers' lasting contributions to tee theater at Bucknell."

Despite losing two of the starting six singles performers, Reynolds predicts, his team "" should be able to maintain close to the same finish."" Taking over the first singles position will be sophomore Steve Haas, who was 8-5 at fourth singles and finished second at that position in the ECC championships last year. With the "" challenging""  20-match schedule, Haas "" will have to play very well to have close to a .500 record,"" Reynolds said. Juniors Bill Beneke and Eric Simpson and senior Paul Adkins are slated for the second through fourth singles slots, respectively, with Mark Greenawald '83 tentatively in the fifth spot. Freshman Mike Driscoll -- as well as sophomores Simon Hall and Andy Walker -- will join Greenawald in competing for the fifth and sixth singles positions. Doubles combinations will be Haas and Greenawald at number one, Beneke and Simpson at two and Adkins and Driscoll at three. The team's strength "" lies in our balance and depth. Our players don't vary that much from (positions) one to six,"" ac cording to Reynolds. The key to success throughout the season will be "" winning consistently from number three on down,"" Reynolds said. He cautioned, "" What we need is a little seasoning""  for a winning campaign."
Women's Tennis,""" This is the best team we've had yet, and the others weren't shabby"" is women's tennis coach Rose Ewan's description of her squad. Ewan can back up her lofty remarks with a quick check of the record of the fall 1980 edition of her team, a squad that went 6-1. However, "" the spring schedule is a lot tougher than the fall schedule""  Ewan said, warning against over-optimism. Among their 13-game slate--that opens Tuesday with a home match against Susquehanna--are four Division I schools and some top Division II competition. Ewan noted, "" Our problem will be to stay tough in the big points. We're going to have to dig deep within ourselves to come up with the big points."" Leading the way for the Bisons will be Patty Koch '83 and Sarah Krieger '82 who "" give us a nice combination""  at first and second singles, according to Ewan. Koch had a 5-2 individual record in the fall and Krieger was 6-1 at second singles. In the third spot will be senior co-captain Kirsten Schaubauer (3-3 in the fall) while Cindy Appel '83 (5-2) holds down the fourth singles position. Senior co-captain Janis Huber (5-2) and freshman Laura Kirschsten (4-2) play in the fifth and sixth positions, respectively. The doubles tandems Will be Krieger and Shuber, Koch and Appel and Schubauer with Kirschstein. "" Doubles competition is our strength,""  Ewan remarked, citing as evidence the doubles team's combined 20-1 record last fall. With no organized ECC championship for women's tennis as yet, Ewan would "" like to get a bid to the Easterns (EAIAWs).""  The coach cites as keys to an invitation "" defeating rivals Lehigh and Lafayette or being within one point""  and compiling "" a 4-3 record"" in the seven dual matches exclusive of a six match Southern tour scheduled during Spring Break."
Softball,"With eight of nine starters returning, the softball team has high aspirations for an improvement over last season's 7-8 mark. Coach Terrie Grieb hopes her charges can pick up right where they left off last spring, when the Bisons capped a three game winning streak with a season-ending 14-0 whitewashing of Mansfield State. Missing from the starting nine will be Betsy Doyle '83 -- the team leader in bat ting (.455) and RBI's (15) -- who is in Lon don for the semester. However, six starters return who hit above .300 a year ago. The pitching staff that "" will be better than last year""  -- according to Grieb -- boasts two of the best hitters on the squad. Junior Dawn Straub hit .364 with 12 RBI's and posted a 5-2 record on the mound and sophomore Denise Cohen hit .349 and scored 18 runs. Cindy Connelly '84 is the third starter while the chief reliever will be Jill Henry '81. The starting infield has senior captain Patty Inchalik (.323 last year) at first base, junior Ali Brown (.220) at second, sophomore Jackie Crump (.394) at third) and sophomore Linda Palm (.384) at short stop. Starting behind the plate will be Stephanie Buck '82, second on the team in hitting (.444) and first in runs scored (21) a year ago. Opening day outfielders will be Kaye Swartz '82 in left field, either Cohen or Straub in center field when not pitching and Meg Giansello '84 in right field. The Bisons open their 14-game schedule with a first-ever encounter with Wilkes Tuesday in Scranton. Grieb predicts, "" we'll be pretty good defensively; I'm not- sure offensively."" Unable to practice outside yet, Grieb said, "" We're still working on fundamen tals.""  Nevertheless, she predicts the team will "" have much more depth and more pitching than last year."""
Women's Track,"With its season opener not until April 12, the women's track team still has time to relish its outstanding indoor season and prepare for the outdoor campaign. Eight returning women who hold 17 school records outdoors will lead the Bisons into their opener against Lock Haven, 84-34 losers to Bucknell a year ago. In addition, the track team broke eight in door school records on its way to a seventh place finish at the EAIAW championships in Boston March 7-8. The outdoor trackwomen ran up a 5-1 dual meet record last year, placed first among 10 teams in the Binghamton (N.Y.) Invitational and finished second of eight squads in the Hartwick (N.Y.) In vitational. The Bisons have strength in the hurdles, sprints, middle distances and field events, with school record holders returning in each category. Lonnie Fertik '83 -- holder of school marks in the 100-meter and 110-yard hurdles, long jump, high jump and pen tathlon -- will again score heavily for Coach Diane Ware's trackwomen. "" We're really looking forward to the outdoor season. "" There's lots of improvement to be made,""  Fertik said. Middle-distance record-holder Jo Bur rell '83 (mile) joins junior co-captains Suzanne Hecker (200-meters, 220-yards) and Linda Accettura (400-meters, 440- yards) in the longer sprints to give Bucknell experience in track events. Sophomore Beth Bittel holds school records in the shot put, discus and javelin to lead the field events. Laurie Van Wyck '83 holds school records in the 400-meter and 440-yard hurdles and is a standout in relays as well. The most promising newcomer for the outdoor season is freshman sensation Nan cy Russo, who established school records in the long jump, 55-meter dash and 300- meters in the EAIAW indoor champion ships."
M en's Track,"With a first place finish in the East Coast Conference cross country championships and a third in the ECC indoor track meet already under his belt this year, Coach Art Gulden looks confidently toward similar success from his men's outdoor track squad. "" We may not be the favorite (for the ECC outdoor crown) but we'Fe sure as heck capable of winning it."" The Bisons were favored for the indoor ti tle, but came up short in finishing a disap pointing third behind Temple and St. Joseph's. Gulden remarked, "" We were definitely overconfident. If we correct that deficiency outdoors, we'll be right in the pack."" Last year, the trackmen were undefeated in five dual meets and triumphed over 11 teams in the Hartwick (N.Y.) Invitational before being outdistanced by Delaware, 125-100, in the ECC championships. This spring, Gulden predicts, "" If we realize our potential in every event, we can win the meet."""
A,""" w ell rounded te a m ' ' with "" possibilities in every event""  will be the key to dethroning the two-time defending champion Blue Hens at the ECC cham pionships, according to the Bucknell men tor. The Bisons -- strong once again in the distance events -- have improved con siderably in the field, weight and sprints events. Sophomores Ted Lewis (high jump and long jump) and Jamie Dodd (pole vault) in the field events, juniors Mike Ward (shot put) and Jim Passannante (weight throw) in the weight events and junior Martin Carter in the sprints are expected to carry over their indoor success to shine in the outdoor campaign. In addition, the "" experience gained by our young competitors indoors""  should propel many other new faces into the win ners' circle. Gulden mentioned Temple, St. Joe's (both conquerors of Bucknell indoors this winter) and Delaware as the Bisons' main competition in the conference. However, he concludes, "" If we score in every event, I don't think anyone can beat us."""
Go//,"With a little help from Mother Nature, the men's golf team will tee off its season against Susquehanna Tuesday on the University's golf course. Coach Jeff Ranck's linksmen are out to top their third-place finish in the ECAC Southern Sectional Tournament last fall and fourth-place finish in the ECC last spring. The loss of Dave Richards, who graduated in December, will not help the Bisons' cause. Richards led the golfers the last two years, ending his Bucknell career with a second place finish in the ECAC finals last spring. Enough talent remains, though, that the Bisons should "" probably go about 6-1 or 5- 2, maybe even 7-0 if we get lucky""  in dual matches, according to Ranck. However, "" That is not the important thing to me. I want us to improve in each tournament."" "" A realistic goal would be to finish se cond to Temple in the ECC,"" Ranck said. "" It would be practically a miracle to beat Temple, but we might be able to surprise them.""  He added, "" The same type of finish in the ECAC would also be realistic. A win in one or the other (ECCs or ECACs) would be great. That would get us into the NCAAs."" Leading the five returning lettermen are Rob Wagner '81 and Rick Kramer '83. "" In the absence of Richards, it may be man datory to get those kinds of performances (like Richards' ) out of both of them,"" Ranck said. The remaining starters are likely to be sophomore Bill Francis and juniors Jeff Buley and Mike Stoyla. Francis "" can be counted on to be a consistent contributor"" and Buley has "" lots of potential or talent at times,""  according to Ranck. Stoyla "" has been on the brink of playing some great golf for us for the past two years,""  he add ed. Kevin High '82, John Stasko '83 and Peter Orr '84 "" have the potential to become starters for us,""  Ranck concluded."
Women 's Lacrosse,"In only its third year of varsity competi tion, the women's lacrosse team enters an expanded 12-game schedule with a high degree of anticipation. Coach Sally Starr is optimistic. "" We're ahead of ourselves as far as last season"" when the Bisons were outscored 74-41 and had a 2-5 record. "" We should be in every game,"" she said. For an improved record, the team "" must execute better and cut down on er rors,""  according to Starr. "" Last year we made a lot of unforced errors as a result of inexperience."" The Bisons open against Lehigh Thurs day on the West fields. "" That game will show how far we've come. Last year, we weren't ready for them (losing 13-3) and that was at the end of the year,""  Starr notes. Leading the offense against the Engineers will be attackers Anne Kennedy '82 and Ellen McCahon '81. Kennedy has led the squad in scoring the past two years with 23 and 12 goals in 1979 and 1980. Mc Cahon was second a year ago with 11 goals. Starr sees improvement in the defense as well--with Liz Rabenold '81 the stand out. Rabenold is "" pivotal on defense""  said her coach. The graduation of Kathy Kline leaves a large gap to fill in the nets. Kline made 112 saves for a .602 save percentage as goaltender last year. Her replacement has not been decided as yet, according to Starr. The squad is anxious to begin play out side because, "" They sense that it could be a banner year -- with a lot of hard work,"" Starr concluded."

Frazier leads women,
s,
swimming to 19th in nation,"By ROBERT BURNEY "" We didn't expect to do so well,"" beamed junior Bitser Dexter, in an understated appraisal of her team's per formance at the A1AW Division II Swimming Champion ships, held last Thursday through Saturday at Northern Michigan University in Marquette, Mich. The Bison swimmers, 20th place finishers in last year's AIAWS, smashed seven Bucknell records en route to a nineteenth place finish with 98.5 points. Clarion State cap tured the championship with 439 points. Bison standout Kathy Frazier '82 established four of the all-time marks. In the 100-yard butterfly, Frazier broke her old record of 59.37 seconds by .72 in the trials. It was not a record to stand long, however, as she shattered it once again in the championship with a time of 58.43, good enough for 4th place. Friday the 13th proved no nemesis, as she eclipsed her own Bucknell record of 2:10.95, clock ing 2:10.92 in the trials of the 200-yard butterfly. In the finals, Frazier finished seventh in 2:12.09. A fourth place finish in the 50-yard freestyle provided Frazier with her third Bucknell record of the competition, with a time of 26.94. Finally, she took 23 seconds off her record in the 50-yard freestyle, picking up eighth place in 25.30. Dexter, for her part, set new school records in the 100- yard breaststroke and 200-yard breaststroke. In the 100, she broke the 1:10.89 mark she had set herself with a 1:10.75 13th place finish. In the 200 Dexter topped the previous Bucknell best with a time of 2:33.63 in the trials, surpassing it again in the finals -- clocking 2:33.53 -- as she garnered 14th place. One other school record has eclipsed by freshman Lisa Desrochers in Thursday's 200-yard backstroke finals. Desrochers owned the record going into Marquette, then shaved 1.07 seconds off it in the trials with her time of 2:14.19. She improved upon it again in the finals, captur ing 12th place in 2:14.12. In all, Frazier finished in the top eight in five events, the 100-yard freestyle being the only one in which she didn't set a new record. As the first eight in each event earn AIAW All-American status, Frazier qualified in these events plus two relays, for a total of seven All-American events. Her career total is now 16 All-American events, j She attributed her performance, like that of the team as a whole, to being "" rested, tapered, and ready."" It was "" better individual performances, rather than anything mechanical that did it for us,""  she said. Dexter and Desrochers in their individual events -- plus Karen Young '83 in a relay -- also became All-Americans. Coach Joel Feldman said she was "" ecstatic""  about the team's performance. Noting that the competition included the top 64 AIAW teams, Dexter said, "" We did pretty well with the tough competition."" i n t r o d u c i n g"

"Laxmen overcome F&M, 7-5, in opener","ByKENQUAAS A pesky Franklin & Marshall offense gave Coach Sid Jamieson's laxmen a scare before falling to the Bisons in the final minutes of a chilly season opener Wednes day. F&M brought a team to Lewisburg that dropped a 10-5 decision to Bucknell last year but froze the laxmen in a series of deadlocks which made the game more dif ficult for the Bisons than it should have been. Sam Vail started the scoring for F&M in the first period -- setting off a series of game-long exchanges between the two teams. Rink Smith '83 put the Bisons on the scoreboard minutes later after a final pass from senior tri-captain Jim Gilbert. The first period ended in a tie after Vail and tri captain John Morris '82 exchanged tallies. The second quarter was marked by slop py ball handling -- which punctuated the entire game--and much end-to-end play. Following an F&M tim e out, mid fielder Rodney Brown '83 stunned the Diplomats with a quick, unassisted goal, but F&M cam e charging back and tied the score at three, less than two minutes later The action intensified in the third quarter when Mike Poldino put the Diplomats"

Jamieson said he "" didn't know what to expect""  in the opener and is concerned about the Bisons' lack of offensive power. "" It's going to take some time for us to get settled on attack,""  Jamieson said. "" We didn't play well againstF&M."" Senior tri-captain Stu Berger agreed with the coach's assessment of the Bisons' level of play. "" We had to work out the pre-game jitters,"" he said. "" I was frustrated because I thought we should have blown them out."" While Jamieson said the midfield and at tack "" need help,""  he was quick to compli ment the play of the young defense -- an chored by Gilbert -- which features sophomore Mike Frahlich, who saw little playing time last season but has "" improv ed 100 percent,""  and freshman Geoff Chen- worth. "" F&M is a cutting and feeding team and we shut them down to five goals. Our defense dominated the attack,"" the coach said. Jamieson said he was especially pleased with the play of All-East Coast Conference goalie Berger, who turned in an "" outstan ding perform ance.""  Berger recorded 12 saves -- eight in the second half -- and stalled the pressing Diplomat offense with his steady net tending. "" We count on Stu to make some super plays. He has to for us to be successful,""  Jamieson said. Bucknell faces some brutal competition in coming weeks. The Bisons next compete in the Loyola Tournament in Baltimore March 28-29, and will prepare for peren nial power Maryland, currently ranked sixth in the nation (Division I). Opponents Syracuse (ranked third nationally and the team which had the "" best recruiting year,""  according to Jamieson), Rutgers, fifth-ranked, and no. 15 Army round out a rocky regular season for the laxmen. "" We're not as strong as we have been,"" conceded Jamieson, "" but we'll gain con fidence as the season progresses. The F&M win will help."" Jamieson said the primary aim of the team is success in the ECC. He cited Delaware as an "" excellent""  team and said the Blue Hens are the "" number-one pick"" in the conference. Defending ECC Cham pions Delaware nipped the Bisons 12-11 last season, and have beaten the laxmen three years straight by a single goal. Berger agreed with the coach about the prevalent desire to bag the Hens. "" No question about it. If I had to win one game, it would be Delaware. We haven't beaten them since I've been here, and they're the ones we want."""
'Play ball'will sound,

hardballers seek revitalization,"By KAREN TARNOW With an experienced nucleus of players from last rear and a strong group of freshmen coming up, the rarsity baseball team looks for improvement over ast year's 3-17 record. Coach Tommy Thompson -- having been with the only two weeks since the end of basketball season -- is looking forward to getting outside with the team for some real practicing. "" They have been working hard (indoors),""  Thompson said. "" I'm en thused and optimistic about this season."" For the first time, the Bisons had fall workouts to cut down the number of players so that spring prac tices could be better organized with more time for individual work. This enabled the players to become "" a closer - knit team ,""  according to Thompson. The starting lineup shows some defensive changes, with Jim Cawley '82 moving from second base to shortstop, Jim Eick '82 from shortstop to left field and senior captain Bill Lawrence from third to first base. Cawley (.342) and Lawrence (.320) were the top batters on the team last year. The rest of the lineup includes senior Scott Dow -- who hit .303 last year -- returning at catcher, sophomore Paul Bamford in center field, freshman Brian Bastecki in right field and senior George Kangos at second base. Third base is still undecided with sophomores Jim Frantz and Doug Clark and freshman Larry Daniel competing for the hot cor ner. Last season, the pitching staff was overworked due to a busy schedule because of rain outs. They surrendered 7.07 runs per game. This year's staff, while young and relatively inexperienced, has much more depth, according to Thompson. Ken Durr '82, who was credited with all three wins last year, Tom Ganter '81 and freshmen Mark Glatz and Jim Smith, will com prise the starting rotation. Ed Hughes '83, quarterback for the football team, has made the transition from spring football to baseball this year to join the mound staff. The 27-game season looks challenging but Thomp son hopes to start off the season with a few wins so that the team can gain confidence. The Bisons open against F&M at 3 p.m. Tuesday on Memorial Field.

KuKluxKlan cancels appearance here,
Grand Dragon defers to Black Arts Festival,"By BILL THUM A Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan early this morning can celled a scheduled recruiting drive in Lewisburg this weekend when he learned that the Klan's appearance here would coincide with the ninth annual Black Arts Festival. Citing what he said were the Klan's interests in "" fighting for equal rights for all mankind regardless of color and creed,"" Grand Dragon Jim Locke said the Klan's leadership determined it would be best not to appear at this time so that the "" special pro gram for black students could oc cur successfully and without inci- dent."" In an exclusive interview with the Bucknellian, Locke--the highest ranking officer of the In visible Empire of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan north of the Mason Dixon line--said the Klan did not know about the festival at the time the plans for their ap pearance were made, and they D espite the p ossib le ap pearance of the Ku Klux Klan this weekend, the Black Arts Festival continued as planned. Page 13. wanted only to "" raise awareness of the organization, distribute literature and recruit new members. "" There was no intent to create a disturbance,""  Locke said. The Klan will reschedule its drive in Lewisburg for May 9, Locke said. , Upon learning of the K lans decision, Black Student Alliance President Kevon Makell '81 said, "" Beautiful! Now the festival can continue without the com plica tions of the Klan being in the area. The Bucknell Progressive Caucus, which was generating plans for a protest of the Klan's presence, will continue to gear up for the now delayed arrival, Andy Brody '82 said. Although pleased the Klan had taken into con sideration the concerns of the Black students, Brody said, "" we must demonstrate our disagree ment with the basic tenets of the Klan."" Dean of Student Affairs John Dunlop said "" Although the Klansmen would not have been given permission to com e to cam pus, their decision to cancel their visit to Lewisburg removes the concern for those of us who strongly support the Black Arts Festival."" Lewisburg Police Chief Donald Heiter, who was also told by Locke that the trip was cancelled, said "" although I hope the Klan will not arrive tomorrow, this does not effect any plans I have made to provide the fullest pro tection in this situation."" The Klan first made its in terests of recruiting in Lewisburg known to the University and the Lewisburg Police on Monday, when they requested permission to distribute literature and to recruit new members.

ABS passes revised scholarship proposal,"^ to be awarded on the basis of diverse Suarez said the fir s t^ m te n t was E D A K I V  n A V / I C By LISA CERUTI The ABS Congress unanimously approved a revised ABS scholarship proposal March 23 which was amended to include a stipulation that recipients must have "" diverse backgrounds"" as well as a "" potential for ac tive leadership."" The amended proposal, which was written by members of the Steering Committee and representatives of BSA, includes three re quirements for receiving aid which are in tended to be consistent with the "" intentions of previous legislatures,""  according to ABS President Michael Suarez '82. The new legislation, which "" addresses the need for a more varied student body"" enonifios that scholarship funds will continue to be awarded on the basis of diverse backgrounds "" with respect to race, socioeconom ic status and educational ex perience."" The second and third re quirements for recipients are the demonstra tion of financial need and the potential for ac tive leadership. . ,, * .. .. Suarez said the congress "" felt tiie diversity stipulation was implied""  in the first proposal but its intention apparently was not expressed correctly. ___ __ ... . Frank Davis '82, incoming BSA President, who was present at the drafting of the revised proposal, said the amended legislation is thoroughly acceptable. "" The original pro posal had too many loopholes which could be manipulated by the administration,"" Davis Suarez said the first document was "" in nocuous and benign. If there was a mistake, it was mine as a presiding officer, not that of the ABS Congress, and I erred in not making our intentions clear."" According to Director of Financial Aid Ronald Laszewski, the revised document is a stronger proposal and is worded more effec- tivdv. . Ken Wolckenhauer '82 said the ABS' gift of the scholarship is just a gesture and congress should not get "" wrapped up in the details. The scholarship proposal was revised after a meeting of the ABS Steering Committee and members of the Black Student Alliance March 17 to discuss opposition to the proposal noscpri unanimously March 10."

Faculty will attend leadership workshop,"^ . . . * . i <<.r iU A (n il p o m o c ta r i'h a m h p i By BILL THUM A four member team from the University has been selected to attend the Lilly Endow ment Workshop on Liberal Arts at Colorado College in June. The workshop, funded by the Lilly Phar maceutical and Medical Supply fam ily, in vited 35 colleges and universities to apply for participation to investigate topics of specific interest to each institution, Dean of Arts and Sciences Robert Chambers said. The strengthening of administration and faculty leadership was selected by Chambers to be the topic of particular importance to the University. "" A review of the productivity of University committees and the difficulty of establishing a consensus within the faculty has shown that some help is needed,""  Chambers said. Chambers chose four areas of faculty and administration leadership to focus on: cur ricular reform, eliminating mental barriers that tend to separate the humanities and sciences faculties, personnel matters and staff planning. "" These problems must be managed if Bucknell is to prevail in the 80s,"" Chambers said. - Twenty-two institutions will be attending the workshop, which will investigate 12 specific topics of interest. A formal report will be presented to the University at the beginning of the fall semester, Chambers said. Chambers asked for comments and recom mendations on his suggestions from  the facul ty at its monthly meeting Monday. Questions were directed to the reasons behind the choice of representation from the University, and specifically to the absence of a woman on the panel. Chambers said he was required to attend by Lilly; Professor of Mathematics David Ray and Professor of English John Wheat- croft were selected due to their respective positions of chairman and secretary of the faculty; and Associate Dean of Arts and Sciences Manning Smith was picked to repre sent the sciences.'*"

A Talent Grants freeze,*
__,#
recommended by ABS,"The implementation of a freeze on Athletic Talent Grant spending at its present level of 60 percent of all University Talent Grant aid will be recommended by the ABS Congress to the University Board of Trustees in M sy The Congress approved by a vote of 14-9 March 23 a "" position paper""  which presents the views of the Congress towards the University's talent grant program. In addition to the freeze on athletic grants, the paper also recom mends that the total talent grant program should remain at its pre sent level of 40 percent of all University financial aid. ABS Secretary Lon Castle '83 said "" there have been rumors""  that the athletic talent grants would be increased to 70 percent of all talent grants, or 28 percent of all financial aid. According to Castle, "" the ABS wanted to look at the financial aid program in depth and see if we could freeze it."" Ken Jenkins '82, a 1981 varsity football tri-captain, said he oppos ed the freeze on athletic talent grants. "" I think the reason the issue came up is that the trustees are thinking about raising the percen tage of aid given to athletes,""  he said. ABS President Michael Suarez '82 said the University is "" aiding only 50 percent of those who demonstrate financial need and Con gress believes we should not increase the amount awarded to athletes."" According to Suarez,"" ABS congresses in the past have written position papers after votes have been taken. We're attempting to jump the gun a little bit. This way the faculty and trustees will know how the ABS feels."" The position paper also stipulates that the distribution of all talent grant funds be reviewed periodically by the Ad-Hoc Committee on Admissions and Financial Aid and "" that a representative of this committee report its findings directly""  to the ABS Congress upon completing each review. _____________ By TRICIA KENNEDY and BILL THUM The Department of Chemistry has received grants totalling $150,000 to purchase a Gas Chromatograph -- Mass Spectrometer Data System. The GC -MS system is used to identify the molecular structures of unknown compounds, in cluding pollutants, Professor of Chemistry Hans Veening said. "" It can be used by students in the departments of chemistry, chem ical engineering, biology, psychology, and environmental sciences,"" Veening said. The formal announcement of the grant was made by Assistant Dean of Arts and Sciences and Pro fessor of Chemistry, Manning Smith, at the March 25 meeting of the University Committee on Plan ning and the Budget. Efforts to acquire the grants began four years ago by Veening, Chairman and Professor of Chemistry Harold Heine and Professor of Chemical Engineer ing William Snyder. University President Dennis O'Brien "" was instrumental in making contacts and securing several sources of funds,""  Veening said. Funds for the grant included a gift of $7,000 by the Merck Co., $12,000 from  the DuPont Corp., $50,000 from  the Dreyfus Foundation and $25,000 from the National Science Foundation. The University and two private donors contributed the remaining funds, Veening said. A technician will be required to handle the com plex workings of the machine, and Veening said two-thirds of this cost is already covered in the Department of Chemistry's budget for 1981 - 82. The difference will be made up through a contingency fund which is provided for in the University's budget for just such a need, Provost Wendell Smith said. Veening said additional funds will hopefully be generated by outside use of the device. Although com m ercial users such as the Merck Co., the state's Department of Environmental Resources and Sylvania Corp. would be charged for use, other ; academ ic institutions will probably receive free use, Veening said. "" The entire process of determining the 35 or more elements in a compound could take more than 24 hours, so the firm s would be charged for the time on the machine and for the technician's labor,' Veen ing said. The GC-MS Data System will arrive on campus during the last week in May and should be fully operational by the end of June. Technicians from Finnigan Instruments, maker of the system, will be on campus to install the unit in a room on the third floor of the Olin Science Building."

BPC conducts an Energy Fair,Q t Photo--Carl Jensen
STUDENTS FOR BROCKHAUS,"-- G raduate student Ellen Yea- gle watches a student sign a petition urging the University to re-consider its decision last year to deny Assistant Pro fessor of Philosophy Richard Brockhaus tenure. Gregg Ro senblatt '84, who organized the project entitled ""Students for Brockhaus,"" said 120 signatures were collected March 24 in the University Center M all; he expects to collect more before eventually presenting the petition to University President Dennis O'Brien. ___ By LISA HABERNICKEL The impact ot energy on environmental concerns, government policy and the development of new resources was the topic of the Bucknell Progressive Caucus' Energy Fair March 22-24. Combining a film festival and lecture with the BPC's second Teach-In of the semester, the BPC sought to raise the awareness of the energy situa tion to the Bucknell community, organizer and BPC member Betsy Shrier '81 said. Shrier and Claire McCarthy '81 said the atten dance which increased from about 30 on the first day to more than 250 on the last was very pleasing and ""demonstrated the community's concern."" During the teach-in, nine BPC members presented information on energy including United States energy policy, energy alternatives, the Reagan Administrations's energy biases, conserva tion, the limitations of fossil fuels and the potential for oil shale development. An open floor discussion followed. Tom Trimble '82 said current energy policies are short-sighted, and Americans in general are unable to view the implications of the energy situation in the long run. Henry Daas '81 said the development of conservation and renewable energy supplies represented a much more realistic long range policy than that of the continued exploitation of fossil fuels. Dave Jones '81 said there was possibly a conflict of interest in Reagan's Energy Task Force, since many committee members also sit on boards of utilities and oil companies. In addition, Secretary of Interior James Watt, a self-pronounced anti-environmentalist, has pushed for the continued use of fossil fuels as a panacea to the situation, Jones said. The final night of the energy fair brought A1 White, a leading environmentalist, to Olin Science Auditorium to speak on decentralized energy and designs for self-sufficient energy living. White sup ported individual responsibility for energy supplies as represented by solar power in home units."
Students selected for Phi Beta Kappa,"Seven juniors and 21 seniors were selected March 20 for membership in the University's chapter of Phi Beta Kappa, the oldest and most prestigious honorary scholarship society in the country. More than 200 students were originally eligible for selection in the fraternity on the basis of grade point average, but 50 per cent of these were cut after the grade minimums were raised to 3.7 for juniors and 3.5 for seniors, according to chapter President Connie Pechmann '81. O ther req u irem en ts for eligibility included three letters of recommendation from each candidate -- who must have liberal arts courses accounting for 60 percent of his or her courses, Pechmann said. Induction of the 28 new members into the organization will be at a dinner in the Universi ty Center Refectory May 7. After ward, Professor and Chairman of Geology and Geography Richard P eterec and Professor of Political Science and Religion Douglas Sturm will hold a discus sion on ""Morality and Higher Education,"" scheduled for 8 p.m. In the UC Forum. The undergraduates who will be inducted are: Seniors: Lynne Andreades, Margit Bessenyey,.

Klansmen cancel weekend rally here,"From KLANSMEN, page 1 administration's decision to deny the request was not to be con veyed to the Klan until today, rumors of the Klan's possible ar rival spurred concern of both students and LewisbUrg citizens. Concern was acute on campus due to the planned festival and in troduction of prospective black freshmen and their families to the campus. "" Even if the Klan does not try to disrupt the festival, their presence wul definitely have a negative psychological impact on both the prospective freshmen and the student organizers of the event, Makell said Thursday. Originally it was believed that the Klan had scheduled its ap pearance specifically to interfere with the festival. Emotions reached a peak Thursday when more than 150 people attended the BPC meeting to plan a response to the Klan. While some called for a direct protest of the Klan's arrival, Associate Professor of Sociology Kim Scheppele said emotions should be channeled into support of the black students by attending the Black Arts Festival events. However, BSA members said they would rather have students attend due to their own interest and not for other motives. Following the meeting, 35 students went to the Lewisburg Police Headquarters to learn what Chief Heiter's response would be. Heiter said city or dinances didn't permit him to deny the Klan the opportunity to distribute literature. He had, how ever, required that a registration form be completed including the names and ad dresses of all participating K lansmen and the specific time period that they would be recruiting. In addition, Heiter said he would distribute copies of local ordinances and a map of the boro to the Klansmen to insure that there would be no misunderstan ding of the limits of their rights. "" If they don't do what they should, I 'll throw them the hell out of town,""  Heiter said. Although Heiter wouldn't com ment on the specific preparations being made for the Klan's ar rival, he said the mutual aid pro gram of the 15 area police depart ments and the State Police at Milton had been alerted both to the possible Klan involvement and schedule of the festival's ac tivities. When initially contacted by the Bucknellian Thursday night, Locke was unaware of the scope of the festival and said, "" the coin cidence of the festival and the Klan visit represent the new reputation of the Klan in support of freedom of choice and equal rights for all."" Locke said denial of permission to recruit on campus would not change the Klan's plans, since "" the original interest was with the boro itself."" _______ "" The Klan has found that the appearance of Klansmen in the traditional regalia tends to incite a bad feeling and therefore the use of robes wouldn't be en couraged,""  Locke said. Concerning firearms, Locke said, "" those members who are legally registered to carry firearms may do so at their own discretion -- nothing illegal will be used."" Early this morning, Locke returned a call to the Bucknellian to report that the Klan's leader ship had decided to cancel the visit."
""" I","hope the efforts of the blacks on campus to increase diversity and strengthen their education succeed and the Klan will not try to inhibit this goal."""

Soviets warned by,
NATO defense aides,"Defense ministers of the North Atlantic Alliance warned the Soviet Union Thursday that military intervention in Poland "" would have profound implica tions for all aspects of East-West relations."" The warning was issued despite an announcement that the War saw Pact military maneuvers in and around Poland had ended. The officials also expressed their concern about the unceas ing Soviet buildup and improve ment in the whole range of their nuclear forces. While individual governments have expressed concern about the Soviet threat to Poland, this was the first united display of concern by NATO over the Polish issue."
CIA requested to,
re-examine Soviets,"A draft report produced by the Central Intelligence Agency has concluded that there is insuffi cient evidence to support charges by the Reagan Administration that the Soviet Union is directly helping to stir up international terrorism. Given the public accusations by foreign affairs spokesmen that the Soviet Union is financing, equipping and training interna tional terrorist groups, the draft has stirred debate between CIA officials and the Administration. The CIA's National Foreign Assessments Center--the agen cy's analysis unit--has been asked by Director of Central In telligence William J. Casey to review the report's conclusions. Congressional officials voiced concern that this request in dicates the Administration's pressuring of the agency to tailor its view to fit administrative policy."

A requirement that more than a half million gallons of fuel be emptied from Columbia's giant tanks and to purge them before refilling takes 48 hours, making a blastoff sometime Saturday im possible. Astronauts Robert Crippen and Capt. John Young were 16 minutes from the scheduled 6:50 a.m. liftoff when the flight was scrubbed. Souders was said to have been attending a "" Grateful Dead""  par ty at the fraternity before the ac cident. Laboratory tests showed no drugs present in Souder's blood, but, undetermined amounts of alcohol and caffeine were discovered. The death is believed to be ac cidental, but the Snyder County District Attorney has not ruled out the possibility of "" foul play."""

Trinity College radio station WRTC was forced off the air for several hours April 1 after an an nouncer for the station reported that Reagan had died while in the hospital. The station was allowed to resume broadcasting later in the day, but the announcer was banished from  WRTC by the Federal Communications Com mission. The Dally Pennsylavanian, campus newspaper at the Univer sity of Pennsylavania, included a column the same day by Dominic Manno, who wrote that he hoped Reagan would die from  the wound he received in the shooting.

Sigh of relief,
At first there was a moment of tense disbelief. Could it really be,
that a leader of the Klan was calling off what we were then sure was,
a direct protest of the Black Arts Festival? Assured by the Klan,
"leader that they had indeed demurred, we let forth a communal sigh",
of ecstatic relict*,
"It is a sigh we hope you will join us in, for we have all been",
spared a weekend potentially fraught with a level of tension that,
could have gone far beyond even the fervor and scope of the anxiety,
traditionally associated with a meeting between blacks and their,
historic tormentors. Despite the stated intentions of the Klan's visit,
to Lewisburg -- Locke assured us from the start the Klansmen,
would concentrate on recruiting downtown rather than harassment,
"near campus -- the emotions of minority students and "" majority""",
students <<1**<< could have ignited whether or not the visitors,
displayed physical or verbal reminders of their reputation.,"Thankfully,"
"that fuse has been lengthened until May 9, when",
Locke says 20 or more representatives of the KKK will conduct the,
drive for membership that was to have been Saturday morning.,
"Given a month to prepare ourselves emotionally, students of all col",
"ors should be ready, willing and able to react to or ignore anyone",
from the Klan we come in contact with that day. It will be tough for,
the blacks to stifle an almost inbred hatred in a way the whites may,
not understand; it may be equally as difficult for many white,
students to stifle a curiosity blacks might find disgusting.,
"In the meantime, let us all relax and enjoy the "" poeting""  of b.f.",
"maiz, the playing of Woody Shaw and his quintet, the preaching of",
the Rev. Lee Butter '81 and the rest of the Black Arts Festival.,
And a special and warm welcome to the minority students (and,
their parents) who are considering spending their college careers,
with us. You should be able to see a special place on a special,
weekend.,
The right move,
"We encounter samples of our peers' writing every week, and so",
the news first released by the Committee on Instruction in October,
really came as no surprise. As editors--albeit untrained--we have,
seen enough examples of poor syntax and grammatical error to con,
vince us the committee's conclusion that half Bucknell's students,
have trouble with writing is in no way an exaggeration.,
"The Cl's proposal, although tinkered with since the fall, still",
strikes us as a credible and plausible way to solve the literacy pro,
blem here; we wholeheartedly recommend it to the professors that,
will debate and decide its fate in 10 days.,
What strikes the most pleasant chord with us is the document's,
wholistic approach.,
"In putting the plan before the entire University faculty, we hear",
the committee agreeing with us that the ability to write is something,
intrinsic to everyone's education -- from the English major to the,
electrical engineer. And in writing a proposal which encourages all,
departments to offer courses focusing on writing skills for different,
"academic disciplines, the group asserts that the ability to teach",
writing is as intrinsic to good instruction.,
Our principal hope for now is that all our teachers will flock to,
the Forum for what promises to be a lively debate with a lasting con,
sequence for those being taught.,

No gun laws means a house divided under the gun,
By Dean Andersen,"II was a sobering Spring Br<<ak. The events that took place made a farce of what daily events we consider "" important."" The fin ding of yet two more bodies in Atlanta and the assassination at tempt on President Reagan caus ed even more despair for our already grief-stricken country. A very bad feeling is in the air, and we are plagued by it. After we received the good news that Reagan would live and we all had a chance to take a breath, conversation turned to the would-be assassin and his weapon -- the handgun. Current ly, there are bills floating around the Senate which have, as their intention, the "" lifting"" of gun control. This means that people could legally possess a firearm and would be licensed to carry it. If this piece of legislation goes through, it would, in my opinion, prove to be the very downfall of America. The problem lies within ourselves. We are becoming con ditioned to think that murder with a firearm is commonplace and that the solution is to "" give everybody a gun so that we'll be evenly matched."" The anti-gun control proponents see the lifting of such laws as a way for "" honest people to protect themselves."" But there is no protection against a gun. Lifting gun control would only make the destruction that much easier to do. Fanatics would have a field day: there would be shoot- outs in major cities and vigilante groups would scour the coun tryside lookine for trouble. We can't hide behind guns. Ar ming ourselves to the teeth and then running scared will only serve to pull us even farther apart as a natior. Imagine this: every person in America, each one a frightened individual, would become a walking time bomb, ready to go off at the slightest notion of trouble, even if none exists. There would be a total breakdown of trust. We would eye our neighbor with suspicion, actually expecting him or her to attack us. Psychologically, we would alienate ourselves -- no longer would we be "" One Nation, Under God.""  We would now be "" A House Divided, Under the Gun,"" a coun try of pistol-packin' mamas, papas and kiddies. In the wake of last week's hap penings, the time has come to ask: Is this really what we want for the United States of America? Dean Anderson, a junior from the Bronx, N.Y., is a double major in English and psychology."
Promise of justice for all,
By Glen Tullman,"The choice between guns and butter is a simple description to help understand the decisions our country is now facing. For many years, we as a nation have enjoyed prosperity. We have been rich enough to afford gups and butter. While we carried on the most expensive war in history, we also managed to start a "" war""  on poverty, although we didn't do especially well on either. We no longer live in a time of prosperity. The economic crisis has forced the country to reevaluate our priorities. The Reagan Ad ministration has apparently opted for guns over butter, but this is not what concerns me here. More important is the subtle decision that we, as individuals, have made or at least come to accept -- we can no longer afford justice for all. In a growing economy, it is easy for an individual to be just and fair because it "" costs"" nothing. But in a stagnant economy, things are much different. When the pie stops growing, giving someone a bigger slice means getting less. It costs to be fair. Not only has the pie stopped growing, but inflation seems to be shrinking it. People are having to accept less, and many are seeing that the dream that one's children will be better off than one is only a dream. But as Ellen Goodman said recently, "" There is a dif ference between the lives of people whose paychecks are not keep ing up with inflation and the lives of people who have no paychecks"
is a thing of the past,"at all.""  Increasingly, our concerns are for our own prosperity, even at the cost of others' justice. The signs of this new "" cost"" attached to justice and fairness are apparent in all sectors of society. A recent government survey of high school seniors "" found a sharp decline in the percentage of those who believe that working to correct social and economic ine qualities is very important."" Another sign is in the lack of opposition to Reagan's South African policy. Reagan sees South Africa as necessary, not to our survival, which in fact it is not, but to our prosperity. Will the coun try be willing to overlook racial discrimination for prosperity? If things get worse, will the same attitude prevail here? Senator Edward Kennedy, said, "" The commitment I seek is not to outworn views, but to old values that will never wear out. Programs may sometimes become obsolete, but the idea of fairness always endures. The middle class may be angry, but they have not lost the dream that all Americans can advance together."" F rankly, I'm not sure -- perhaps we have lost the dream. Perhaps it has become too expensive. But let us beware: if we cannot afford justice and fairness, which is really what our actions and decisions are telling us, the other options may be more expensive in the long run and the savings may be no bargain at all. Glen Tullman is a senior from New Providence, N.J. who majors in psychology and economics."
Realism rebuked by BPC with occasional cynicism,
By Keith B. Ritter,"I don't understand the Bucknell Pro gressive Caucus. I've always thought of myself as pro gressive, yet I find many of their arguments untenable. To me, a pro gressive is one who has struck a har monious balance between the often discor dant dispositions of realism and idealism. Maybe I'm wrong, but the Caucus seems to have rebuked realism, giving it only an oc casional cynical mention. Why my cynicism with the Caucus? I guess it evolved slowly only to be ac celerated recently by the rantings of the Catechist. I wanted to accept the group as progressive, but their actions continued to bother me. I suppose the last straw was their opposition to the ROTC war games; that did it. In my mind I must proclaim -- the Bucknell Progressive Caucus is not progressive. To me, the recent BPC outburst against the ROTC demonstrates that not only has the Caucus lost touch with reality; it also has no desire to reacquaint itself with reality. I agree with the Caucus that war and killing are morally repulsive -- I haven't lost my idealism -- but I accept the fact that governments and thus wars will probably always exist. I don't think that the Caucus is anar chistic, so I think they would agree that governments serve* a purpose, namely to insure the rights and safety of their citizens. It does not take much of a realist to recognize . that humans have been fighting since before people bothered to record history, and that they are not likely to stop tomorrow. Governments, since they are merely extensions of human vir tues and vices, shall also continue to fight and kill -- although hopefully not as fre quently as in the past. If one accepts the sad though realistic belief that wars will indeed occur from time to time, the next logical concern is who should be in control of the fighting forces. Again, I may be idealistic, but I would much rather have a college- educated individual leading the troops than some former street gang member. Perhaps exposing someone to a little history, a modicum of philosophy, and a sprinkling of other assorted courses will instill a greater sense of morality and justice in that person. Maybe, just maybe, such training will help prevent such atrocities as My Lai from occurring in the future. The possibility, however remote, of preventing these tragedies justifies such a program. Once these recruits have been chosen, they will need to practice. One would be a fool to think that quoting Plato could pre vent the enemy's assault; and one would have to be a fool, and a sadistic one at that, to suggest that untrained soldiers should be sent to fight. Now, if you are going to train Bucknellians to fight, where should it be done? In the outreaches of Alaska, the deserts of Arizona, or R. B. Winter State Park? No. All of these places would be fine, but let's be practical. If there is an ap propriate place to practice on campus, that is where they should practice. But wait -- the Caucus might interject -- there is a moral issue involved here. Wrong. War is a part of human nature, albeit an unfortunate and tragic one. It is the Progressive Caucus that continually claims that Bucknell is akin to never-never land and that the students need to be better briefed on what is happening in the "" real world."" What better way is there to do this than by bringing a taste of war, even if it is only a practice war, here to Bucknell? Keith B. Ritter '84, is a double major in physics and political science from Lancaster."

Is a tanned body really a sign of,
a contagious out-of-state disease?,
By Jeff Casten,"I have recently noticed an outburst around the surrounding area of a strange disease. I hav(r) diagnosed this disease as the dreaded Easter Syn drome. This disease has many different symptoms, one of the most obvious being the darkening of the super ficial epidermal layer. After several days a white flaky material and darker brown spots appear on the face and other exposed areas. The victim of the dreaded Easter Syndrome is often found with a large economy-size bottle of lotion among his per sonal possessions. I have also observed that the wealthier class is more susceptible to this disease. The carriers^of the Easter Syndrome, mostly adolescent, oiten| aJ ^ in small groups, as if they were actually proud of be ing victims. Their most common symptom would be their tendency to wear light colored clothing and short sleeved shirts. I have discussed this matter in depth with my fellow classmates but still have no definite evident as to what the cause of this dreaded disease might be I do, however, know that the victim travels out of the state of Pennsylvania just before acquiring the disease. Therefore, I theorize that the Easter Syndrome must exist in other states and be con tagious. I know of no cure for the dreaded Easter Syn drome. All that I can suggest is that yourem aini^ side your home, wear heavy clothing, lock all the doors and windows and, most importantly, do no g out of the state until after Easter and the entire month of April has passed. ____________ _________ __ Jeff Casten, 83, is an economics major from Pittsburgh.

By Phil Andrews,""" Moral Majority""  became a household name in 1980. The politically active religious group played a major role in the defeats of liberal Senators Birch Bayh, Frank Church, John Culver and George McGovern. The organization was widely c r it ic i z e d , h o w e v e r , for trumpeting itself as the "" Moral Majority.""  A member of the Unicorn Society -- a group that seeks to. abolish inaccurate descriptives -- said, "" I am not sure whether they are moral or not, but I am sure they are not a majority."" The latter part of this observa tion was recently confirmed amidst the intriguing results of a survey conducted for the Connec ticut Mutual Life Insurance Com pany by John C. Pollack of Research and Forecasts, Inc. Ac cording to Connecticut Mutual, the survey sought to assess "" American values in the 1980s."" The survey consisted of a public sample and a leadership sample. Of the 4,000 people inter viewed for the public sample, 1,610 completed the one-hour telephone interview. And of the 4,388 leaders in nine different fields sent questionnaires through the mail, 1,762 respond ed. What did the results show? 1. There is not a "" Moral Ma jority""  in the United States, but that America's institutions are increasingly being shaped by a fervently religious minority that has a much higher sense of political efficacy than do those people surveyed categorized as least religious. On an eight-criterion scale of religionity ranging from Bible reading to prayer to religious proselytizing, 26 percent of the respondents reported that they frequently did at least five of eight activities. The report, Pollock said, "" iden tifies a cohesive and powerful group of Americans, approx imately 45 million strong, as in- t e n s e l y  r e l i g i o u s , and demonstrates that religious Americans are likely to vote often and to become highly in volved in their local com munities."" 3. America' s leaders are significantly less religious than the general public. Thus, they may underestimate the influence of religion in American life. religious respondents oppose it. These findings, says the report, "" illuminate the political suc cesses of such groups as the 'Moral Majority' and suggest"

Crosby to give acoustic,
concert here on May 5,"By ALLISON ABOUCHAR Singer David Crosby, formerly of the popular rock group "" Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young,""  will give two concerts of acoustic music at 7 and 10 p.m. May 5 in Coleman Theatre. There will be a warm-up band appearing with Crosby, but since no one has been presented with a concert bid, ticket prices have not been set, according to Assistant Bucknell Concert Committee Chairman RichSchaberg'81. Because the David Bromberg concert in March was so well received by students, the BCC decided to hold the Crosby concert in Coleman Theatre with reserved seats. The hall has better acoustics and the smaller size lends a more intimate atmosphere, Schaberg said. Crosby has been contracted for $4000 for the two shows, and his ap pearance here will be in conjunction with a tour. Crosby began his musical career in the 1960s with "" The Birds,"" and began singing with "" Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young""  at Woodstock in 1969. The band broke up and reunited several times, once in 1971 and then again in 1974, when they recorded the popular album "" CSN"" without Young. j 3"

Ninth Black Arts Festival opens with play & lecture,"t > i _ a m --  << 4  *7 >>i rvi f/\nir>>v>t m cii7 <<<<riii onnWnpt o p i i n i r  o t # lid n m . ^ ^ The ninth annual Black Arts Festival opened here yesterday with a lecture in the afternoon by Sylvia Ardyn Boone, assistant professor of history and Afro- American art at Yale University, and a presentation last night by the Labor Theater of New York City. Boone spoke about "" Ideas and Ideals of Beauty in African Art,"" while the Labor Theater presented Railroad Bill, a play set in the context of the Populist movement of the 1890s and depicting the true story of a black train robber who became the legendary "" black Jesse James"" of his day. Written by C.R. Portz, the show was accompanied by rousing blues and ragtime music. The Labor Theater is made possible through funding from the National Endowment for the Arts. Nationally known poet b.f. maiz will recite his poetry in a reading entitled "" May I Poet with You?"" in the University Center Forum at 7 p.m. tonight. Maiz, originally from Alabama, will give a workshop entitled "" Ques tions about life"" from 3:15 to 4:15 this afternoon in the U.C. Comer Room. Maiz has written more than 1000 poems which he has committed to memory. He first submerged himself in poetry while in prison where it became his "" heaven, hell and salvation."" Maiz served a total of 18 years in federal prison as a result of several drug violations. "" Job Opportunities for Young Blacks"" will be the title of a talk by John Smith of the U.S. Com mittee on Labor and Education. He will speak from 11 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. Saturday in the U.C. Corner Room. Two young lawyers will con duct a workshop on "" Law in the 80s"" from 2 to 3:30 p.m. tomor row. Norma Brown '77 and Will Traylor '73 will lead discussions in rooms 241A and D in the U.C. The Woody Shaw Quintet, a jazz group from New York City, will conduct a clinic at 3:30 p.m. in the U.C. Forum in which the group will play and discuss music. The Quintet will also give a concert at 8 p.m. Saturday in the University Theatre. Tickets are $5, or $2 with a Bucknell ID. The Rev.

Charles Stewart and the Good News Singers, a group from nor thern New Jersey, will sing a variety of gospel music. Frank Davis '82, newly elected president of the Black Student Alliance, said the festival "" can really be something big if the University community makes a commitment to try to under stand another culture. It will really be disheartening if all students don't take advantage of this opportunity.""

Masks exhibit presents,
playful pieces and more,"By KAREN RITCH An exhibit of masks by 18 artists-illustrating some of the most innovative and vigorous examples of the contemporary art fo rm - opened Tuesday night in the Center Gallery at a reception attended by more than 100 people. Many of the masks in the exhibition, which was curated by the Visiting Artists Collaborative and circulated by Independent Curators Inc. of New York City, were created for use in per formances, while others are sculptural facades which examine the face and the mask as an expression of being. Constructed from such diverse materials as papier mache, acrylic, crocheted wool, wax and gauze, plaster, wood and leather, the masks in the exhibit range in size from small facial coverings to more than four feet in height. The display is accompanied by a checklist and essay by Anne Cohen De Pietio, formerly associated with ICI. The artists in this exhibition chose varied forms of the mask as a viable medium with significant impact. Peter Schumann, of the Bread and Puppet Theatre, creates colorful caricatures which delight both the children and adults in his audiences. As traditional expressions of the mask in drama, these playful pieces have their roots in classical Greek theater, , __ Jeff Way uses the mask as >>traditional medium in the perform ing arts, but his bold abstract forms convey a more contemporary expression. These masks create anonymity without providing a new identity. Many of the other artists in the exhibition explore the meaning ot the mask as a visual statement rather than as a disguise to be worn. In her 29 pieces, Theodora Skipitares creates a feeling of move ment, like freeze-frame photography, by repeatedly focusing on the face as a means of expressing emotion. Conversely, Nina Hallinger uses the mask as a purely sculptural form, void of emotion, as in her latex body mask titled "" Skin."" ,, The show will remain here until April 28. The Center Gallery is located in the third floor of the University Center and is open weekdays from 12:30-4:30p.m. ___________________________ _ ______ _"

Spring theater season ushered,
in with one-act 'Cocktail' series,"By LYNNE RUTHERFORD The spring theater season will be ushered in with a series of one-act plays being held in the University Center Cave beginning this week. These "" Cocktail Theaters"" --so named for their pre-dinner starting time of 4:45 p.m. are free entertainment provided by Professor of English and Theater Harvey Powers' directing class. The Cocktails are the first chance students get to direct here and they open doors for fresh acting talent as well. Many of the works are more experimental and unusual in nature than the regular Coleman Theatre fare. . _ For instance, Wednesday's The American Dream by Edward Albee, as directed by John Braile '83, in cluded film footage and slides, as well as a piano ac companiment by Terri Barous '83. Next up will be Ernest Thompson's lighthearted comedy, A Good Time--to be performed this after noon and directed by Jackie Krull '83. The play in volves a girl who talks her way out of a traffic ticket by promising a policeman "" a good time"" and deals with the complications that arise when the man comes to claim his bribe two years later. On Wednesday, A Touch of Marble comes to the Cave. Directed by Dawn Sanderson '82, the play ex plains a 34-year-old woman's present loneliness by exploring her past. Peter Swet's The Interview portrays the con flict between an old Jewish tailor and an arrogantly efficient insurance investigator. Directed by Jawaad Abdul Azziz '82, it will be staged Friday. On April 24, Eugene Ionesco's The Bald Soprano, under the direction of Cynthia Lempert '82, will be performed. An absurd comedy, it is a wordplay be tween a group of people attempting but failing to communicate. Fumed Oak--described by author Noel Coward as "" an unpleasant comedy in two scenes"" --will take the spotlight May 6. A frustrated man decides to leave his crabby household in this play directed by Donna Hansen '83. Director Bruce Delaplane '82 will stage Conrad Bromberg's Actors on May 8. The play deals with two actors discussing life over a game of chess. The Collection, Harold Pinter's play of two col liding relationships--one involving two men and the other concerning a man and a woman, is directed by David Hancock '84 and is scheduled for May 11. The season comes to a close with Frank Marcus' The Window directed by David Blackman '82, which explores the cruelty inflicted by individuals who prey on a blind man. Ruth M ills 83, Fred Nowicki '84, and Carrie Wilshusen '84 perform Edward Albee s American Dream W ednesday in the University Center Cave. The play, directed by John Braile 83, is a part of a series of one act ""Cocktail Theaters"" which are being performed this spring."

The out come was a 19-2 loss. Thompson attributes toe up- and-down play of his team to "" the inexperience of youth,"" but adds "" toe whole team has been work ing hard, looking to improve.

Lacrosse is off to a slow start;,
defeats Gettysburg but loses 3,
1,"By KEN QUAAS "" We're having a problem put ting together four good quarters of lacrosse,""  said senior tri captain Stu Berger in describing the play of the Bisons since their 7-5 season-opening victory oyer Franklin & Marshall. The laxmen dropped a tough contest to nationally-ranked Rutgers Wednesday in New Brunswick, 15-9, but it was a first quarter lapse from  which the Bisons never recovered that made the difference in the game. The Scarlet Knights cam e out firing on their home turf, jump ing to a 5-1 first period ad vantage. The stunned laxmen countered with some offense of their own and pulled the score up to within three at the half, with Rutgers on top 7-4. But despite some good defen sive play, particularly on the part of senior tri-captain Jim Gilbert in sticking high-scoring at- tackman Mark Tyree and holding him to just three tallies, Bucknell never recovered from  the first quarter onslaught which left the team playing catch-up ball. "" I thought we could have beaten them,""  said a disap pointed Berger following the match, "" but they beat us to the ground ball, and our first quarter killed us."" The lacrosse team now stands at 2-3, with eight regular season games to play. The laxmen spent part of their Spring Break in Maryland competing in the Loyola Tournament. Powerhouse Maryland -- ranked fifth na tionally -- gave the Bisons a drubbing in the second half of the tourney opener after the team held the Terps to seven goals in the first half. The depth of talented Maryland's bench as well as 14 penalties assessed the Bisons -- resulting in continuous man-down situations--contri buted to a score that ballooned from 7-3 to 19-6. The laxmen were not destined to enjoy a relaxing Spring Break, as Loyola, ranked No. 2 in Divi sion II, pinned them with a 16-8 loss in the consolations. Like the Maryland duel, the Bisons were well within reach at the half, trailing 8-6. And once again, it was the sloppy second half lapses which sent the team back to Lewisburg with its first losses of the season. The break did end on a happy note, however, as Gettysburg was dealt a 13-7 setback April 1. Junior tri-captain John Morris paved the way by notching five goals, while George Cusick '83 and Rob Mathai '82 added three and two, respectively. Mighty Syracuse, a team which crushed Bucknell last season, 224, rolls into town tomorrow boasting a national ranking of third.

more proposed Federal aid cuts,
WASHINGTON,- Three members of the Association of Bucknell Students Congress were am ong the estim ated 1200 students from 48 states here Monday to lobby against the R eagan A d m in istra tion ' s proposed cutbacks in financial assistance programs for college students.
ABS,"Vice President Missy Campbell '82, Trax Dorm Council President Steve Habetz '84 and Roberts Dorm Representative Tricia Kennedy '84 represented the University at the Coalition of In depen den t C ollege and University Seudents (COPUS)- sponsored National Student Briefing Day on Student Aid Cuts. The conference opened Monday morning with a briefing of student delegates by COPUS National Director Steve Leifman, Chairman of the House Post secondary Education Sub committee Paul Liman (D.-Ill.) and Rep. Peter Peyser (D .-N .Y.), a member of that subcommittee. Students were urged to actively protest the proposed cuts which, according to Leifman, "" in effect will repeal"" the 1979 Middle Income Student Assistance Act. F ollow in g the b rie fin g , students sought out their representatives in the Senate and House office buildings. But since Congress is now in recess, many of the congressmen were not in town. "" It was discouraging that no one was there to hear our views, since those plans will directly affect me and many others,"" Habetz said. Under the anticipated budget for fiscal year 1982, the Ad ministration has proposed to increase the tax rate on discretionary income calculated in the Pell Grant (BEOG) from  14 percent to 20 percent. The Ad ministration would in addition require an annual $750 self-help contribution from students, except in cases of extreme financial need. The Administration has also proposed eliminating 40 percent of the current recipients of guaranteed student loans by requiring the demonstration of real need for the amounts borrowed from private lending institutions.. Should the Reagan proposals be voted into law, according to the Am erican Council on Education, an estimated 600,000 of the 2.7 million students now receiving such grants of $200 to $1800 would be dropped from  the program. Countless others would be forced to accept substantial reductions in the grants they will receive. The C ou ncil said the elimination of Federal payment of student loan interest could add $2250 to the cost of four years of college and cause huge numbers of students to drop out. In addition, these educators expressed concern that lower income ceilings on student loans m ight force sm all private colleges to close, since more students will be likely to enroll in less costly public institutions.

May 9. The BPC decided to counter the Klan's membership drive with a counter-drive to warn,

COPUS National Director Steve Leifman briefs more than,
1200 students from across the nation who gathered in,
Washington Monday to lobby against the Reagan Adminis,
tration's proposed budget cuts in student aid.,"relies more on its endowment and private funds than on federal aid, it will not be affected by Reagan's budget cuts as much as many other universities will be. However, he said the amount of aid awarded to incom ing freshmen will have to be reduced should the Administration's pro posal be voted into law. Cam pbell, who m et with several congressmen and their staffs representing districts in New Jersey and Pennsylvania during the afternoon, said she was "" pleased""  with the overall response of government officials to the students' lobbying efforts. She noted that "" there is a real need for students to write to their representatives concerning this issue."""
Explosion in Olin brings,
$1 OOO total in damages,"An explosion Friday afternoon in a top floor laboratory of the Olin Science Building caused an estimated $1,000 damage to equipment and > supplies, and raised serious questions about the adequacy of ventila tion in the lab. Head and Professor of Chemistry Harold Heine described the explo sion as a "" vapor air explosion.""  He said a "" tremendous amount of dioxane vapors and air "" got into the hood and got sparked,""  probably causing the explosion. Although the exhaust hood was apparently working properly, the laboratories need "" more efficient hood motors.,""  Heine said. Although one person was in the laboratory room at the time of the 5:05 p.m. blast, no one was injured. ,- The student conducting the procedure in the hood, Regina Zibuck 81, said she was attempting to dry the chemical dioxane, a solvent, which is used in experiments in its pure state. She said that "" setting up was the only part""  of the process that involved her presence. Zibuck was not in the building at the time of the explosion. Graduate student Dennis Wright -  the only person present during the explosion -- escaped unharmed. Acting chief of Security Michael Amarante responded to an emergency call and notified the fire department upon arriving on the scene and seeing heavy smoke. Firefighters expelled the smoke with portable exhaust fans, and gas lines to the entire building were shut off immediately."
Andrews suggests changes for a more effective ABS,
ABS members lobbying against,"By JEFF CROSS In an effort to make the ABS Congress more effective, form er ABS President Phil An drews '81 has recommended that upperclass dormitory representatives be replaced with representatives from  departmental m ajors. Andrews also made 10 other proposals con cerning structure and operation of the ABS in a paper presented to Congressmen Monday. The report is the first study of the governance structure as it now exists since its inception in 1978. The Congress will hear a formal proposal from  Andrews April 7. Since most students feel more kinship with their department than with their living unit, they would have a greater responsibility in their representation of their department, Andrews said. Dormitory representatives hold 23 of the 42 Congress seats but are infre quent participants, according to Andrews. Freshm an dorm itory representatives would be retained due to their strong attach ment to their dormitories, Andrews said. The report's other m ajor proposal is to em power the ABS vice president, instead of the president, with control of congress meetings. The president "" tends to dampen criticism ,"" Andrews said, and "" many congressmen are wary of being overly critical of the presi dent's suggestions."" With the president free to concentrate on executive duties, the additional power of the veto could be added as a check on the con gressional actions, Andrews said. The proposal would also create two new posts in the ABS steering committee. The president would appoint a press secretary to accurately disseminate information about the congress, and an elections director would be added to relieve the responsibility of the vice president and protect against any con flicts of interest in an election. Both would be subject to the congress' approval. The final structural change would require the candidates for ABS president, vice presi dent and treasurer to run together to foster coherence on the steering committee. "" Just the fact that they are willing to team up says something about their com patability,""  An drews said. The operational changes suggested by An drews would require monthly progress reports from  all students involved on com m it-1 tees and abolish executive sessions that are closed to the public. Andrews said he is "" relatively confident"" the ABS will consider his report. ABS Presi dent Michael Suarez '82 -- although not in favor of every measure -- said the paper's "" greatest merit is that it will stimulate discussion, criticism  and suggestions from the ABS and outside groups. It can only help the ABS."" Dean of Student Affairs John Dunlop, who sponsored Andrews' project as a Jan Plan and is also the ABS advisor, called the pro posal "" a good one,""  although "" that does not necessarily mean I endorse everything in it."""

D irector of Admissions Richard Skelton and Director of Financial Aid Ronald Laszewski fielded questions from more than 20 students, faculty and ad m inistrators regarding re cruiting methods, the athletic talent grant program and the general priorities of the Universi ty.Responding to a question from Assistant Professor of Physics Stephen Becker, Laszewski said, of the amount of the talent grants pegged to athletics, close to 90 percent consists of direct grants to offset the normal $1500 to $2200 self-help requirement. In essence, Becker said, athletes receiving talent grant aid are re quired to supply little if any of the direct cost of their education. In this light, Associate Pro fessor of Geology Edward Cotter questioned if there was some way the University could attract academically motivated students in addition to the ""collegiate"" types. Provost Wendell Smith said it was not so much that students are either ""collegiate"" or academically motivated--but rather how the climate of the campus shapes its students--that is important."

Awareness Week.,
Handicap Awareness Week focuses,
on misconceptions about disabled,By LYNDA CHAPPELL
and,
BILL THUM,"Concern and Action, with funding from the ABS Congress, is presenting a Handicap Awareness Week beginning Monday to inform the community of the problems and frustrations of the handi capped. ""Our goal is to open the doors, both physical and attitudinal, that limit the handicapped in their desire to live a normal life,"" program coordinator Karen Wark '81 said. The activities are not de signed to evoke sympathy but rather increased awareness, respect and understanding, Wark said. ""Many of the events are specifically designed to provide simulations of the limitations; including physicial mobility, audio and visual, faced by the handicapped daily,"" Wark said. These simula tions will be coordinated by Sharon Woltz, who received a Masters degree in Counseling and Guidance from New York University. Woltz has done extensive work in the field of the public's at titudes toward the disabled person and believes many limitations stem from the public's own misconceptions about the handicapped, Wark said. Also featured will be Michael Murphy, an assis tant to the Rev. Bruce Ritter -- founder of crisis centers for runaway teenagers and children. Mur phy will describe the life of these runaways and describe his work with these children. Murphy received his Bachelor's degree in Social Service from Fordham University and has worked both in New York and Washington D.C. Representatives of ARISE (Alternatives for Reaching Independence through Services and Engineering) will share their experiences as han dicapped people and suggest ways to function without the limitations of one's disabilities. ""Images,"" a group of undergraduates from Bloomsburg State College, will present a per formance on signing music. Through the use of sign-language, the group will express the non verbal communication that is natural for the deaf. Throughout the week there will be luncheon discussions, lectures, films, displays and enter tainment including mouthpainting and a children's puppet show. Work on the program began in September, when Wark began to formulate goals and contact par ticipants. ""Although Bucknell is beginning to make physical improvements to provide easy ac cess for the disabled, many attitudinal barriers exist here and in our society which thwart the han dicapped person's integration into the community, Wark said. If we can make an effort to break these barriers, a whole new world will be opened to a large part of the community,"" Wark said. The United Nations has-recognized discrimina tion toward the disabled and declared 1981 the Year of the Handicapped. ""Hopefully, the week will increase the awareness and understand ing both on campus and in our lives and enable us to accept the handicapped as equals,"" Wark said."

Journalists query,
during press conference,"By MATT KARAN1AN A handful of journalists turned the tables on Charles Kuralt in the University Center Wednesday, putting the CBS News Correspondent on the receiving end of a field of questions during a press conference in ^T h^reporters represented three regional newspapers, two local radio stations, and a television station. Kuralt said he felt uncomfortable in such a role reversal position and added that there is "" something vaguely wrong with journalists beS ^ ^ deg m c h O T ^ 1w ite r  Cronkite retired "" you'd have thought the presidency was changing,""  he said. It is easy for a journalist to think of himself as "" important,""  and Kuralt said this is not desirable. He recalled being advised "" just because you have a loud voice, don t let that make you think you're any smarter than when your voice only went as far as across the bar."" Kuralt said at the conference that Lewisburg would of course have been a good location for a story when he was producing On the Road""  for CBS. He said he recalled spending a night m Lewisburg dur ing his travels throughout America, but said that he never actually 8 "" Y o u S d  close your eyes and stick a pin in a of the type of irrelevance""  that was covered for On the Road, he ^One reporter asked Kuralt his stand on nuclear energy during the conference. Kuralt hesitated for a moment, and then refused to offer his opinion. "" I don't express my opinions"" he said, adding that he tries ^Kuralt folded questions from a group of about 50 students during a subsequent "" open classroom""  in the U.C.ForumWednesday mornmg. The "" open classroom""  discussion was informal and lasted for two hours."
NEW S,-------- Photo--Corl Jensen
These 600 students and area residents who came to hear Charles Kuralt Tuesday night in the,
University Center Forum were asked to move to Vaughan Literature Auditonum,
Kuralt reminisces on 'On The Road,"From KURALT, page 1. Cronkite was here to do all that."" Instead, Kuralt described his early days doing the traveling series for CBS, saying half- jokingly he had standing orders from  then CBS News President Richard Salant "" to call the real reporters when I came across anything important."" Salant, who was present at the talk, had been a key figure in the creation of Class of '53 Lectureship. Traveling across the nation for "" On the Road,"" Kuralt said that most of the time he didn't know where he was, but that he didn't care. "" We were trying to spread a little understanding of this country. We were trying to un derstand ourselves."" When asked to comment on the ' ' American character, ' ' Kuralt said nearly anything one says about America is true. "" The land and people are so rich and varied that the character is different from  place to place. ' ' The country, however, is changing for the better, ac cording to Kuralt, and "" the citizens can be appealed to."" The series of two-day visits by media personalities continues April 28 when CBS correspondent Andy Rooney is scheduled to speak as the final installment of "" Messages from  the Medium."""

In addition to Harclerode's po sition as professor of Biology, he serves as an ""intercessionary"" between the University and the NRC. It was Harclerode, there fore, who first received word of the NRC's eased regulations and who subsequently proposed the University act to take advantage of the greater leeway allowed. Harclerode said the Biology de partment currently ships two 55- gallon barrels across country each year by truck at a cost to the University of $2,000. The amounts of radioactivity involved are ""infinitesimally small"" and would pose no threat if burned here, he said, asserting that there is a greater risk trans porting them. If a decision to bum the matter here is reached, it is a ""possi bility"" that the power plant would not be used, Zeller said.

With the time and interest that I have, I am willing to do the job if you are willing to show your support."
Todd Buchholz,
David Grossman,"During my past year as Kress dormitory represen tative in the ABS, I have realized the importance that the ABS Congress and its members have in the Bucknell community. The experience I have gained in this position has been unmeasurable, as I have had an opportunity to witness and take part in the functioning of an active stu dent legislative body; realizing and acting upon the con cerns and needs of my constituents, while also doing my best to contribute to the ABS as a whole body to benefit the University and its students. As a member-at-large, I will have to perform much in the same way that I have this year, yet with an even larger number of constituents. I feel that my sense of responsibility, commitment to acknowledging and enforcing the concerns of the student body, and the experience I have acquired during the past year in the ABS make me a well-qualified candidate for this position."
Mark Hower,"I am seeking this position, not only for the place I will hold on the ABS Congress, but more importantly because my responsibilities will include membership on the Stu dent Appropriations Committee. I frequently attend many events on campus and I have noticed that, in general, students are apathetic about the majority of them. This seems to indicate that the activities available are not fulfilling the desires of the students. In the capacity of member-at-large, I would seek to remedy this situation by allocating money to the budget so it will execute our best interests. I feel my concern about using tion and mine denotes I have the desire to carry out the responsibilities of this position."
Daniel Huek,"The main qualification for member-at-large necessari ly is experience with student government and student ap propriations. The members-at-large are unique in being responsible to the total student body. To step into such a job without the necessary experience and information is hard. As freshman president, I have served this year as a member of the ABS Congress. I have grown from an observer to a participator, and now to an initiator as well. While analyzing and constructing legislation in the Congress, I have gotten to know its workings and its members. Since February I have also served as a member-at-large, the position which I now seek. In this capacity, I have learned the operations of the Appropria tions Committee. I have acted in the past, and I will act in the future, through legislation or comment, on issues concerning student and community life at Bucknell."
Michael Kaye,"One's education lies far beyond the classroom. In this I imply that an education is so much more than just study ing, in that learning is a product of all the activities that we pursue. The campus community provides the op portunity for intellectual, social, cultural and athletic ex perience. It is by taking advantage of all these op portunities that a student receives a unique education. For the past three years I have been involved in various campus activities, and now in the face of accusations of student apathy, I feel it is about time something be done. Remember, Bucknell can be more than just conventional learning. We must make students realize this. I think that by working with the ABS I can help do this."
Christina Kounelias,The reason I am seeking the office of member-at-large is because I have a sincere interest in the way money is appropriated to the student budget and to the various stu dent organizations. It is necessary that this money is ac counted for properly and that the organizations involving and affecting the most students get sufficient funding. This is especially important since this money is generated from every student. I feel that I am aware of general student opinion and I will do my best to see that it is made known to the ABS. Please help me to help repre sent you.
Susan MacDonald,"Oh yeah, ABS elections. The table set up near the UC entrances that you glance at but continue walking faster. After all, it's not going to affect you. "" The ABS never does anything anyway.""  Despite the popularity of these beliefs, ABS does not stand for Apathetic Bucknell Students. Remember scholarships and talent grants? Or how about the Appropriations Committee which doles out the money for student organizations? But why vote for me? Don't worry, I'm not going to recite every office I held during my senior year to high school or list every ac tivity I've attended since my arrival here a year and a half ago. I will say that I have served on ABS for the past semester. I can't promise you that my presence is going to change the world, but I am willing to devote my time and concern to the job."
Edward Mastascusa,
Hank Schreiner,
Helayne Sherman,"The ABS Congress needs members who are open to suggestions from the student body. I am interested in promoting organizations on campus that students have expressed an interest in. As an ABS member, I will work hard to coordinate activities that respond effectively to the needs of the students. I am a member of the Dining Service Committee and one of my jobs is to represent the students' suggestions and work toward a more organized system. Active student involvement is imperative for success. For a more effective representation of student opinion, vote for me."
Bill Thum,"After attending ABS meetings for years without the status of a voting member, and being frustrated in acti vities by the lack of knowledge demonstrated by the Ap propriations Committee, I have decided once again to seek your support for my election. My knowledge and sensitivity to activities at Bucknell has been gained through three years of positive work on University com mittees, special campus events, student organizations and the campus news media. I would like to use this ex perience to both rejuvenate the ABS and legitimatize the Appropriations Committee. Bucknell has a lot of poten tial that is waiting to be discovered. It is going to take those with experience and caring if change is to come. As member-at-large, I would work to see this potential realized."
David Tyler,
Sophomore,
President,
Bob Fessler,"I have two clear-cut objectives for our class: to establish a permanent Sophomore Advisory Council and to increase our treasury. Freshman year was a time to adjust to our new environment. As sophomores, we must consolidate our class and lay the groundwork for our future years. Establishing a Sophomore Advisory Coun cil open to all concerned, hard-working class members would enable anyone to voice his opinion and guide our course. The committee would help plan and implement our projects. This plan will tap the leadership potential in many class members. By increasing our treasury through on and off-campus fund-raisers (movies, flower sales, car washes), our future years will be secure and enjoyable. My two proposed goals if executed will unite our class, assure smooth control and pave a path to three successful years for the Class of '84."
Steve Garfinkel,"During the past year, I have held the position of treasurer of the freshman class. Through this position I have learned much concerning the working of student government at Bucknell. My reasons for running are many. Primarily, I wish to serve the class; I am con cerned with what goes on at Bucknell. I seek the challenge of the office; I want to do the job. I will not hesitate to voice your views and concerns in open forums of the ABS. I look forward to a year filled with social ac tivities. I will publish a monthly newsletter keeping you informed. I intend to invite people to work with the class officers on various projects through class meetings. I did a good job as treasurer and I feel that I can do a better job as president. A vote for me is a vote for experience and accomplishment."
Vice President,
Scott Hoermer,"My first reason for running is the enjoyment I get from working with others. As class vice president for the first semester, I was given the chance to work closely with others and I found I would like to continue this. Another reason I have for seeking is the sense of accomplishment I get from seeing things done right. As vice president, I was able to blend my ideas with those of others to un cover the best possible alternatives. A third reason I have for campaigning is school pride. Bucknell is a school long in tradition, and while vice president I would do my utmost to carry on this tradition of achievement. Putting it all into one line, I would say the vice presidency is a job I want to do, a job I hope I have proven I can do, and a job I hope you--the class of '8 4 - will continue to let me do."
Sec.-Treas.,
Helayne Sherman,"The position of secretary/treasurer carries with it much responsibility and it requires experience as well as unlimited dedication from a hard-working individual. I am treasurer of the Hillel Organization and the treasurer of Bucknell Alliance Against Apartheid, and I believe I am well-qualified for this position. I am willing to listen to your suggestions and see that they are represented at class meetings. Your involvement is an integral part of our class success and I urge you to speak out and be heard. I will contribute enthusiasm, dedication and new ideas to pull our class together. Vote for me and help our class realize its potential."
Susan Stanley,"There are several reasons why I am seeking this posi tion. After having been an active ABS Congress member as Roberts dorm representative during my first year here, I continue to feel the urge to act as a communica tion link between students, faculty, administration and the ABS Congress. There is a strong need for class unity. In order to help obtain this unity, I am interested in hear ing your ideas, researching them and taking action upon them with my co-workers. Your vote for me would be a positive move toward a more cohesive class and reward ing experience at Bucknell."

Junior,
President,
Lon Castle,"If I ever run across the phrase "" class government""  on a word association test, I would probably write "" pizza study break."" This may sound unfair, but after almost two years at Bucknell I cannot think of a single class- sponsored activity other than some type of study break. To me, the function of a class government is to promote diverse social activities. For example, there is a general social lag in September before fraternities begin rush. I propose the classes, either collectively or individually, hold some sort of all campus event during this time -- possibly a band party -- to fill this void. Most important ly, I believe that a poll should be conducted among our junior class to determine what social alternatives there should be. After all, since each individual contributes to the class fund, they should have a say in how this money is spent."
Barbara Fedele,"As secretary/treasurer of the Class of '83 for two years, I have become quite familiar with class activities -- both social and fund raising. In the past two years, I have coordinated various kinds of study breaks co headed the sophomore pre-football game "" munches"" and I am currently co-organizing a baseball cap sale to benefit the Area Agency on the Aging. The office of class president is a position dealing primarily with planning social events for the class and fostering class unity, as well as being a voting member of the ABS Congress and the Committee on Student Programs. Why do I want to be president of the Class of '83? Because in two years I have dealt with many social events. Because in two years I have gotten to know many members of my class and always try to promote class unity. Because in two years I have gained the experience needed to perform the job well."

Luanne Savino and David Hawkings,
George Tsougarakis,"that the office of vice president can be an important one in planning and instituting activities of common interest. to the class. These activities, such as study breaks and pre-game get-togethers (after all, who's not interested in food?) provide a way for the members of our class to maintain ties with one another while pursuing their diverse interests. If elected, I would try to increase the participation of class members in the activities planned and look for new ideas for class projects of interest to everyone. As vice president, I would put enthusiastic ef fort into my duties and would be dedicated to maintain ing the spirit of the Class of '83."
Senior,"The official description of the office of president says that the president's main functions are the planning of social events and the fostering of class unity, but these S p / 1  -- # r C C L S  * aren't the reasons that I want to be president. I feel that ^  * the job should be more than that of a social chairman. As a member of the ABS, he should try to make our class G a i l"
Post,"play an important role in student government as a whole. Furthermore, the president should be more than just a figurehead. For example, how many of you know who our current officers are? A surprisingly large number of students have no idea and this is not only the fault of the officers, but it is also due to the apathy present among students. Therefore, everyone should try to vote and, if I'm elected, I'll do my best to let everyone know who I am and what I'm doing."
Vice President,
Anne Maher,"The reason I am seeking class office is that I would like to work to develop a spirit of unity in our class. I believe Class government serves the student body as mainly a social outlet. This past year as vice president, I worked with the other officers and the advisory committee to provide the sophomore class with numerous study breaks: pizza, cookies & donuts and ice cream sundaes. We also held two fall pre-game munchie parties. As a class we are continuing a fund raising project for the "" Area Agency on Aging""  in Lewisburg. Also, united class officers work together to hold all-campus functions such as year-end band parties. I wish to continue my ef forts next year in the office of secretary/treasurer. I feel I have the leadership experience as a current officer and the business experience after working for three summers in the accounting department of a small firm in New Jersey. The experience and motivation of all the future officers should make for an excellent junior year."
David Flinchbaugh,"After two years as class vice president, I've experi enced first-hand all the road blocks and detours that can turn the best laid plans into a pile of rubble. But through all the campaigns, meetings, study breaks and parties, I've come to know the Class of '82 as an energetic group who can overcome most any obstacle. This year, Ken, Luanne and I have tried to build a strong foundation. We've increased the number and scope of activities, in creased our ABS funding and increased class participa tion. Therefore, for our senior year, the plans will be big ger, the obstacles fewer and the successes constant. I see our class following many of the great senior traditions, but also creating a few traditions of our own. It will take lots of people and lots of work, but it's our senior year, and together we can make it the best. Most people are familiar with the office of secretary/ treasurer as a relatively insignificant position. But what is generally overlooked is that this position is one of responsibility and essential for an effective class govern ment. My active participation during the past three years as a chairman of a CA committee, Dorm Council representative, member of the Class of '82 Advisory Councils and most significantly as an ABS represen tative has given me valuable experience with University government from the "" inside.""  Moreover, I possess the drive and willingness to effectively fulfill the duties of secretary/treasurer while representing you. As an in tegral informatory link between you and the class government, I will attempt to make our senior class government more action-oriented and more responsive to your needs."
Alumni,
President,
Eric Hoemer,"I have been involved in many extracurricular ac tivities during my years at Bucknell. After graduation, I would like to actively contribute to and participate in my alma mater, hence my desire for the position of alumni class president. An active and interested group of alumni will be a vital part of Bucknell's future, and I would like to lead our class' part of that group."
Vice President,
Ray Monasterski,"It seems that too many of us have the perception of the ""alum""  as one who performs the perfunctory duty of donating money to the University and doing little of anything else. Being alumni vice-president of the Class of '81 would allow me to do more than just give money and perhaps change the traditional perception of the func tions of an "" alum.""  Clearly, the alumni constitute a vast medium which can actively aid in implementing the im provements needed in certain areas at Bucknell other than Annual Giving. In addition to serving on the Alumni Board of Directors with the president, my other duty would be to plan the reunion socials. In this capacity, I feel I have the knowledge necessary to make our reu nions events which would produce fond memories of the days of yore."
David Hawkings,
Sec.-Treas.,
Carol Christie,"In a class president, I think the Class of '82 should have someone who knows the personality and the personalities of the class, who knows what we want for an enjoyable , senior year, who knows the ways to get the class what it f j f . p  /  i l f / i r wants and who can represent the views of the group as J J L / U / I ' '82's only voting member of the ABS Congress and COSP. That's a tough order to fill, and I won't presume to say I t >> -l. ] ) ,, . . * can easily fill it. But I think I know most of you and your D C 111 u d  u , 1 ' desires for senior year. And I'm confident in my knowledge of the workings of the University after serv ing on the Bucknellian, two University committees and the board of trustees (as a student delegate.) I'd like the opportunity to put this knowledge to work for what I would hope would be the benefit of all seniors next year."
Mike Palumbo,"A major criticism of the Bucknell campus is its inabili ty to adequately provide enjoyable and original social alternatives for its students. By senior year many view the typical frat party scene as inadequate in either stimulating new friendships or expanding community awareness. The Bull Run Inn (the not so famous bar and grill) becomes the dominant community social center for relaxation, but as yet I have not heard many positive or extremely excited opinions of the "" senior haven.""  As president, one of my primary objectives would be to foster alternative social and community events that will hopefully take advantage of both the wealth of the Buf falo Valley and its senior Bucknell students. Therefore, I am asking for your support so I may have the opportuni- a __ n H n r n n tiir o e  f n r  th n  PlfltLQ o f  ' As a future alumna, I wish to remain involved in the ac tivities of the Bucknell community. I desire to spend wor thwhile time working with the Alumni Office in prepar ing the Class of 1981 Reunion Book. During January of this year and earlier this semester, I was involved, together with another senior, in writing a public relations brochure on the historical aspects of the buildings on the Bucknell campus. This was a challenging and rewarding experience in which I learned much about the origin and progress of this University. As reunion book editor, I want to be responsible for producing a publication on the progress of the Class of 1981."

The Droblem with the disposal of nuclear waste is that it can,
"never really be disposed of. The wastes may be buried, buraedor",

Weare faced with the question of whether it is more desirable to,
"bum the matter here, or to transport it for burial e^ ewbere.",
The NRC doesn't think burning the matter will pollute our at,
mosphere significantly. The radioactivity -  although of sufficient,
magnitude to require transportation by licensed earner andisolated,

New fashions,
"Every year since we've been here, bowler hats have come into",
fashion at just about this time of the spring. We've never really,
understood the phenomenon: freshman women suddenly disappear,
"from the Bison and the library one day; by the next afternoon,",
they're running and squealing like banshees as they chase after men,
in,
the strange black hats we all know as Sig Derbies.,
"We don't know what aU the fuss is about, anyway. Though ap",
"parently for a worthy charity, the Sigma Chi's in the hats do not",
know the monetary worth generated by the weekend event. And,
though former and current sorority pledges say they chase after the,
hats and glorify those wearing them for fun and to promote sisterly,
"unity, we've seen too many wounded physically in Derby combat",
and mentally by derby sexism.,
We hope the compromises affected recently by the Panhellemc,
Council and the brothers of Sigma Chi temper the zealousness of the,
chase and the outlandishness of the treatment of those doing the,
"chasing. These compromises are in our eyes long overdue, and we're",
glad both the men and the women involved in this situation have,
seen their felicity better late than never.,
It will be refreshing to have a different spring fashion this year.,

There's an air of disillusionment in those paragraphs about the,
"institution the candidates wish to become a part of, but very few",

"disenchantment, and the institution which has appeared to foster it.",
And no one had taken the time to force people to think about the,
congress -- and then to combine all these thoughts into some in,
sightful and sensitive suggestions for ways to improve it -- other,
than Phil Andrews.,

"As a former president of our student government, Andrews has",
"not been idling in academe. Instead, he spent his January chatting",
with everyone from Dennis O'Brien to a former Swartz Dorm,
Council president about ABS. And most of his conclusions make,
sense to us. The emphasis his restructured congress would put on,
representation through academic department affiliation could,
perhaps do much to shift what some people here observe as an old-,
"time ""collegiate"" social attitude into a more academic and",
progressive one.,
. . . .,
. ..,
The opinion of Phil's efforts that counts most is not ours in the,
"end, though; it is the ABS's. Perhaps the most valuable task the",
"Suarez Administration will undertake is a long, hard look at itself;",
we hope they are as up for the task as the leader of the old Andrews,
Administration was.,

Truth doesn't belong to,
BPC--who does own it?,
By Jim Castle,"Since the beginning of the Bucknell Progressive Caucus, there have been countless inter changes on the validity of certain stands the BPC takes. This is all well and good. The BPC does not claim  to own the truth; rather it claim s to question that which we have all taken for granted as the truth. When we question any opinion we admit to being part of this ques tioning process. Why, then, is there so much acrid criticism  in the form  of massive generaliza tions about the group and its stands? It is the result of those who think they own the truth, those who claim  to know the reasoning and political beliefs of all the BPC members and those that are fearful of the opinions of others. I am a BPC member."
A,"member and that is all. I do not claim  to stand for anyone but m yself. I could not even begin to describe what the ideology of the BPC is, because it does not have one that can be written into stone. It is true that we share interests but not a universal doctrine. I invite all those omniscient critics who know what the BPC is to our meetings. Because then they will know what questioning is and how little truth one can claim  to know. As far as those who criticize in dividual issues are concerned, I must encourage them to vocalize their disagreement. But to write off an entire group of people as pure idealists, communists, arm chair liberals, manrists, or whatever favorite generalism is at hand would be -- to me among the greatest of sins.

"Houseman: classy, credible and always a gentleman",". * < Um<nnmoti Aminniotoo wnrHs like ""dum-"
By Todd G. Buchholz,""" A gentleman is one who never hurts anyone's feelings unintentionally."" I think I read this quotation on a Salada teabag in the Bostwick cafeteria. Using this definition, there is no better example of a gentleman than John Houseman, who visited Bucknell last month. A rather classy and credible man, Houseman spoke of theater and acting when he addressed a capacity crowd at Rooke Chapel March 13. In an interview, though, he revealed a pointed and pithy tongue. Dressed in a tweed jacket and a polka-dot bowtie, the man who created the role of Professor Kingsfield for "" The Paper Chase reflected on his half-century of experience in American entertainment. "" Did you ever work with President Reagan when he was in the acting business?""  I asked. "" Heavens no. In those days I was a producer and he certainly would not be an actor I would have hired under any circumstances. He just wasn t ^ a, you know, he was a very routine, uninspired actor. That's alright, there's nothing wrong with that."" Houseman--speaking slow ly and authoritatively in the British accent he has maintained despite living in the United States for nearly 60 of his 79 years -- compared the filmmakers of today with the moguls of earlier years. Did the moguls have a more artistic notion behind their work? "" Not so much artistic as professional. They had been in the business for years, they loved it. It was all they knew. Today nobody is concerned with making pictures. They're concerned with finding a block buster, and they're concerned with money."" Houseman's opinion of television executives was even less enthusiastic^ which was not surprising, considering "" The Paper Chase""  had been cancelled by NBC a few years ago for poor ratings. What type of people control television? "" Well, you know. They're in it for profit. There are bright guys there; there are greedy guys there. There are scared guys there. And there is an awful lot of big money, and when big money is there, everyone behaves rather sordidly."" According to the actor-director, a lack of good writers plagues the television in dustry. "" There's a lot of bad stuff being written. The whole problem with television is a very serious one, because the amount of material that television chews up every 24 hours is vast. So what you get is a lot of very hack material with a lot of repetition, a lot of doing what was successful last week. 'Let's do it again.'"" Do people like Rona Barret and Rex Reed know what they're talking about? "" You know, they're not dummies. They get inside information, nothing very hard or sensational, but enough to keep them occupied."" Do you read your reviews? "" Sure, always -- everybody reads reviews. If they say they don't, they're liars. But you read them because they affect the box office, not really because"
THE,
BUCH,
STOP,"you're interested in what the critic has to say. But the critic does still to a lesser degree affect your box office, so you damn well read them."" It's difficult to express in print the way"
THE BUCKNELL DILEMMA,"Houseman enunciates words like "" dum m ies"" and "" liars."" They ooze forth like the final verdict of a British king, and it is this delivery which gives his Smith-Barney advertisements their credibility. "" I was delighted to do them .... they ve been very, very successful. The day before yesterday I was at a reception with the head of one of the big, big, big oil com panies. He said, 'I'm  afraid I have to confess to plagiarism when I addressed my executives from  all over the world. I said I can only quote from  television: 'We make money the old fashioned way we earn it.* 4 . "" I'm  sure his reading was not as good as mine,""  Houseman added. A true gentleman, indeed."

Festival excellent despite KKK threat,
Well rounded view o f art,
received with enthusiasm,"By ALLISON ABOUCHAR !Despite a threatened appearance by the Ku Klux Klan, last weekend's Black Arts Festival was successful, according to Admissions Counselor and Minority Recruiter Zanthia Conway, who coor dinated the event. "" The Klan caused me a great deal of concern, but I was pleased with the way the University responded. Though the threat was negative in the beginning, I think it helped give the festival publicity and create more interest among the community. It was actually a unifying force that worked for us,""  she said. Former president of the Black Student Alliance Kevon Makell '81 also said the weekend went "" exceptionally well."" "" I don't think we can deny the Klan their constitutional rights to solicit membership in Lewisburg, but their presence would have had an influence on the prospective students,""  Makell said. Conway said she was "" pleased with the turnout from  the white community. There was a full house at most every event and I hope the support continues."" Twenty-four prospective black students spent the weekend and "" seemed to have enjoyed themselves. Many confided to upperclassmen that they would like to com e here next September,""  she said. The committee for the festival met regularly for about two and a half months to span the events, according to Conway. The festival began April 9 with a lecture by Sylvia Arden Boone accompanied by slides illustrating "" Ideas and Beauty in African Art.""  The Labor Theater gave a well-received performance of "" Railroad Bill ""  the story of a trin robber who became the legendary "" Black Jesse James""  of his day, through robbing railroad cars and distributing the money to poor farmers throughout the West. One highlight of the festival, a presen tation of b.f. maiz, was precipitated by an"

Maiz said the group should be allowed to speak on the basis of the First Amendment of the Constitution, which was read aloud at the discussion. "" May I Poet With You?"" , maiz's presentation Friday evening, was an in tense recitation of poems composed and memorized by the poet. Walking about as he spoke, maiz prefaced many of ms poems with short stories explaining the source of his inspiration for the piece. While most of the poems were serious, there were several humorous works which broke the otherwise silent atmosphere in the Forum, which held a standing - room - only crowd. Maiz received a standing ovation at the end of the presentation. At "" Job Opportunities for Young Blacks,""  presented Saturday morning by John Smith of the U.S. Committee on Labor and Education, Smith presented a variety of resources for employment possibilities after graduation from Bucknell. The Woody Shaw Quintet, a New York City-based jazz group, played in concert to a full house in Coleman Theatre Saturday night.

Seniors Barry Fishel and Pat Pedro practice for their acting,
"recital ""Ephemeris"" in Tustin Gym Tuesday. The perfor",
mance will take place at 8:30 p.m. Wednesday in the Uni,
versity Center Cave.,"By LYNNE RUTHERFORD Senior actors Barry Fishel and Patrick Pedro will team for the first acting recital presented here in five years at 8:30 p.m. Wednesday in the University Center Cave. The program - entitled "" Ephemeris""  -- is sponsored jointly by Cap and Dagger and the Association for the Arts. Pedro and Fishel, both management m ajors, have each undertaken a wide variety of roles during their four years here. Fishel, seen most recently as the Stage Manager of "" Our Town,""  views the recital as a way of "" trying to extend myself in different direc- k  "" in acting here, I've learned a lot about myself and other people,""  he said. . #,, "" For me, acting fulfills a need. It's a form of self- expression, a way of getting to know m yself better and getting to know other people,""  said Pedro, who has appeared this year in "" T artuffe/' "" A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum, and"
^Our Town*^,"The two began selecting their pieces for this recital in January and have been working steadily on their presentation ever since/The recitol^  an in dependent project advised by Professor of English and Theater Harvey Powers. Although several directors, including Powers, have been consulted by the actors, most of the direc ting has come from  the participants^ themselves. For the technical aspects of the production, they have drawn on many Cap and Dagger members for assistance, especially Bruce Delaplane 82 who serves as Stage Manager for the project. In addition, Gwyn English '81, who appeared with the two in "" Our Town""  and other productions, win perform  a scene with Pedro. "" These pieces deal with restlessness, uncertainty, and growth. We want to demonstrate what we've gotten out of acting here and push ourselves m dif ferent directions,""  said Fishel, who plans to con tinue his acting career after graduation and has been accepted at The Circle in the Square Reper tory Company in New York. The individual pieces, actually short scenes from longer works, have not been advertised on publicity posters because it "" could be misleading, Pedro said. He explained people might mistakenly come to see a certain play, and then find that the produc- tion is a combination of many scenes, one of which is an original piece by Fishel. "" We want people to come for the recital itself, not just to see particular pieces,"" he said. * Pedro, who will attend law school in the fall, added "" We want to entertain and affect all those who see this recital."" . ,, Although he is not directly pursuing an acting career, Pedro plans to continue his theatrical in terests beyond graduation. "" Most people don't realize how many op portunities there are in theater, especially in the summer. I want to participate as much as my time permits,""  he said. , . ^ Both actors say they were well prepared to con tinue in theater by their studies and experiences "" The opportunities are here, but you have to take advantage of them. I did not com e here only to study theater, although I was able to make it an important part of my liberal arts education,""  Fishel said. "" We've been lucky to get such a wide experience here. In many other schools, non-theater majors aren't even permitted to act on stage,""  Pedro said."

By JESSICA WEICHSEL "" Magic to Do,""  an original sign and song show, was performed Thursday evening in the University Center Forum by Virginia Beach, a deaf student from Gallaudet College, the national college for the deaf in Washington, D.C. , Before an audience of 12o university students, deaf adults and children from the Lewisburg area, Beach danced and signed the lyrics of various popular songs while mouthing the words so that members of the audience able to read lips would also be able to understand. The program was preceded by a short introduction in which she thanked Concern and Action for sponsoring her perform ance here. In the distinctive speech of a person who learned to talk without hearing voices. Beach said she would present a visual form  of my m usic.' She ex plained that the music she hears 'comes not from  outside but from  within."" Beach then began with "" Magic To Do"" from the popular Broadway show "" Pippin.""  The dancing and signing moved the audience as Beach swayed and clapped to help keep the beat. Beach used her hands and body to create a visual image of the music she "" hears."" She ex plained she does not hear music with her ears, but with her heart. She can feel the beat of the songs and thus keeps time with the lyrics. Beach introduced her songs with jokes and made an effort to include the audience by teaching them the appropriate sign language for "" Sing""  by The Carpenters. Each half of the Forum audience learned a verse of the song and joined her as she mouthed the words. To add to her . GCLnn Arminn audience and danced around them. As she mimed and signed the song, the audience laughed and sang with her. Throughout the evening her speech was full of humor and her attitude was light, though her message was serious. Between numbers, she signed eagerly to children in the room who were delighted by the presentation. Beach, who is very open about the differences between the hearing and deaf worlds, said she wishes to inspire an interest in deaf people and sign language here. This was her fifth visit here, performing and visiting classes each time. Her appearances are sponsored by the Department of M o d e r n L a n g u a g e s Helen Roby '82, who served as sound technician at Thursday s perform ance, said Beach 'makes words com e alive with her actions. She's a phenomenal bythe Captain and Tenille, Beach person; an unbelievable led five men down from  the tress. *"

Laxmen lose third straight on,
explosive start by Towson State,
|,"By KEN QUAAS The list of the best lacrosse teams in the country is a poll of coaches known as the ""Top 15"" . . ... . , ,, . The Bucknell schedule includes four teams in this week s poll ot those teams revered nationally, and this has been part of the problem forthe2-5Bisons. , ,, . .. . , While eighth-ranked Maryland dispatched the Bisons in the Loyola Tournament over Spring Break and No. 10 Rutgers had the laxmen notched on the victory column by the first period April 8, third- ranked Syracuse invaded Lewisburg Saturday, nailing the Bisons, 13-7. ""We don't just roll over and play dead,"" Coach Sid Jamieson said, ""These schools have much bigger programs than we do. We have a tougher schedule than anyone in the country with a program compar able to ours in scale."" , Senior Tri-Captain Jim Gilbert agreed with that assessment and said ""For a program of our size, nobody plays a tougher schedule. In'addition to the Rutgers and Maryland losses, the laxmen have also been defeated by Loyola-no. 1 in Division II-and Towson State, a squad ranked 14th in the Top 15. . Like Rutgers, Towson jolted the Bisons Wednesday with an early flurry and had already assumed a comfortable 4-1 lead by the end of the first period. In a normally high-scoring sport like lacrosse, a three-goal lead does not mean it is time to relax. But an ineffective offense--the Bisons are averaging eight goals per game--was able to muster but four goals, and the Tigers prevailed, 9-4. ""Defensively we had a good day,"" Jamieson said, ""but when you re limited to four goals and don't shoot the ball well, you can t beat a club like Towson."" The Bisons took 46 shots Wednesday, the same number as Towson. And while the Tigers' three goalies combined for 22 saves, many Bucknell shots did not even come close to their intended mark. Towson's defense was tenacious however, as Rink Smith s unas sisted tallie--his first of two goals-in the first period was only matched by hard-shooting Tri-captain John Morris' '82 two scores in the second and third quarters. Smith capped the Bucknell effort late in the fourth period after a pass from Andy Fraser '83 which caught the Tiger goalie off guard. If the Towson match seemed cut and dry from the start, the Syra cuse contest stood in sharp contrast. , ,,  , ,, ,, , The Orangemen met an initially determined Bucknell group and had it not been for a ""team lapse,"" as Gilbert called it, which al lowed Syracuse to pop in two quick tallies in the closing minutes of the first half, the Bisons would have been on top of the nation s third- rdnkcd tcfliii 4--3 As it was, the letdown cost the laxmen two goals and the lead, but the close 5-4 halftime score was reverberated around campus and the crowd--already large on the sunny Saturday afternoon-swelled with considerable anticipation and intrigue. But it was not the day for upsets. After the Bison scare, the Orange men ""decided to get moving"" said Jamieson. A 5-4 edge was methodi cally increased as Bucknell was outscored by its visitors, 8-3 in the second half, jacking the final score up to 13-7. According to Jamieson, ""It wasn't so much a failure on our part Syracuse moved the ball much better in the second half. Gilbert said ""Syracuse sort of woke up in the second half and we got a little jittery after the last two goals (of the first half) . , Both Jamieson and Gilbert expressed satisfaction with the Bison defense in the last two games and thus far this season. The laxmen held Towson to its lowest point total this season while senior Tri-Captain Stu Berger recorded 22 saves in goal. Jamieson called the keeper's efforts against Towson ""super"", and defenseman Gilbert was quick to agree. ""Stu's been a god for us, he.said. Having passed through the most difficult portion of their schedule, the Bisons stand ready to take on East Coast Conference foes Lafay ette, Lehigh and Drexel in their next three contests--a breather from Top 15 competition. . . - Although both Berger and Gilbert agree that the primary focus of the team is success within the conference, there exists an underlying ambition to upend some of the Top 15 heat on the schedule. ""We've never beaten one of the Top 15 teams,"" Gilbert said, If we can just knock one off, it'll all be uphill from there. Jamieson said, ""For us to play competitively with a Syracuse is a feather in our cap. To win one of these would really boost the confi dence of our kids."" i , , ,, , . And, while an improved Lafayette squad hosts the laxmen tomor row, no. 12 Army looms in the near future (April 29) as another shot at the Top 15. ' ________ __________________"

Returning from Virginia after,
"Spring Break with a record of 3-3,",
the women's tennis team crushed,
Juniata College 9-0 Saturday. Ac,
cording to team member Ann,
"Wilbur '84, the Juniata shutout",

"Virginia, the netters confronted",
three Division I schools at Penn,
"State -- Rutgers, James Madison",
and the host Nittany Lions. The,
"Bisons lost 7-2 to Rutgers, as the",
teams of Patty Koch '83 and Cin,
dy Appel '83 and Wilbur and,
Kirsten Schubauer '81 provided,
Bucknell with its only bright,
spots of the day in winning their,
doubles matches.,
James Madison conquered the,
"netters 7-2, but things could have",
"been worse, as the Bisons were",
able to capitalize on two defaults.,
Powerful Penn State predictably,
beat the Bucknell women 9-0 on,
the diinly lit indoor courts at,
State College. The Nittany lions,
shut out the netters in last year's,
duel as well.,
The pressure lightened a bit in,
"Virginia, as the squad met with",
the smaller Division II schools.,

Sophomore Jill Jackson '83 (left) checks her Slippery Rock opponent in the Bisons' 8-6 loss,
"Wednesday. The two-goal loss was the Bisons' second of the week, giving them an 0-5 record.",
Triumphs elude lacrosse team,
Perhaps the most frustrating way to lose a game,
is by a close score.,
"If this is so, then you won't have to teach the",
women's lacrosse team the meaning of the word,
frustration. The Bisons have dropped all six of their,
"matches this Spring, but four of those five defeats",
were by one or two goals.,
Typical of this season's misfortune was Wed,
nesday's matchup with Slippery Rock in which the,
Bisons were quickly stunned by three unanswered,
tallies in the opening minutes of the first half. While,
"the score stood at 6-3 at the half, the Bisons out",
"played their opponents in the second half, but the",
laxwomen never recovered from the opening on,
"slaught. After fighting from behind the entire game,",
"they eventually succumbed, 8-6.",
"""It was a tough game,"" starter Jeanne Minahan",
"'83 said, ""We weren't coming through on the",
"basics."" Indeed, the game was marked by sloppy",
"passing from both sides, but it was the Rock that",
was finally able to take command and edge out a,
victory.,
Monday's meeting with Colgate provided a,
similar tale. The Red Raiders came to Lewisburg,
determined to avoid the long ride home carrying a,
"loss, and a physical, defensive battle ensued. The",
"checking was ""particularly rough"" according to",
"Minahan, and the end result saw Colgate on top, 4-3.",
Just as the laxwomen were hurt by the initial,
"onslaught of Slippery Rock, a final flurry in the",
waning minutes of the second half of the Colgate,
duel resulted in Bucknell's undoing.,
"Despite the stigma of an 0-6 slate, the Bisons have",
made some improvements over last year in their,
third season of varsity competition.,
While they had notched a victory over Swar-,
"thmore, 104, by this time last year, a 17-8 loss to",
perenially tough Shippensburg was improved,
"slightly by a 12-5 defeat this year. And, while",
Franklin & Marshall dumped the laxwomen by a,
"score of 12-5 in last season's campaign, the Bisons",
held on throughout the afternoon in Saturday's F&M,
"encounter, only to be turned back by a mere goal, 9-",
8,.
"Similarly, the Lock Haven contest on April 7 was",
"encouraging, despite the final 4-3 Lock Haven edge.",
"""Holding them to four goals was quite an ac",
"complishment"" Minahan said.",
While Coach Sally Starr was out of town and,
"unavailable for comment at press time, Minahan",
outlined a bit of the laxwomen's future strategy.,
"""As the coach has said, we've had some golden",
"and some disastrous moments,"" Minahan said, So",
"we're going to try to start the season over.""",
Men's tennis is stopped,
by Rutgers and weatherl,
By ROBERT BURNEY,
The seriously depleted reservoirs in central Pennsylvania have,
"surely benefitted from the rain which has fallen this week, but",
Coach Craig Reynolds can take little solace in that fact. His tennis,
team has been hard pressed to get a match in since returning from,
its Florida tour.,

",",
.,
Last Thursday the rain halted the match against Bloomsburg,
State midway through the first set. Faring no better were the Nit-,
"tany Lions of Penn State, whose stay in Lewisburg was marred by a",
Tuesday washout.,
_,...
"In between, the Bucknell netters did manage to play one match,",
"bowing to Rutgers 8-1 at New Brunswick, N.J. on Saturday.",
Although the third doubles team of senior Paul Adkins and Mike,
"Driscoll '84 notched the only win of the day for the Bisons, the",
match was by no means as lopsided as the score indicated.,
"According to Reynolds, ""Several players were either up m the",
"first set or took the set, only to lose the match in the second or third.",
We could have pulled it out if we had held the upper hana I really,
thought we could have won four of the six singles matches.,
"Adkins echoed the teams' disappointment with its play, but",
"added ""our competition outside the conference is tough, and it",
"helps us gain experience, but it doesn't lend itself to a tremendous",
"dual meet record.""",
.,
"Indeed, the Bisons' schedule includes several very fineteam s, in",
"cluding Rutgers, Penn State, Army, and Rochester. Our goal,",
"explained Adkins, ""is to do well in the ECC tournament in three",

By ARTHUR BROCKWAY,
There is still a chill to the,
"Spring air, but as the season pro",
"gresses, the Bison bats have been",
warming up.,
Bucknell's record now stands,
at 5-9 after a 2-3 week that pro,
vided just a little bit more con,
fidence for the young baseball,
team.,
Wednesday's,
matchup,
with,
Mansfield proved a defensive,
battle for eight innings before,
three unearned runs crossed the,
"plate in the top of the ninth, a cou",
ple of misplayed bunts turned the,
game into a heartbreaker for pit,
cher Ken Durr'82.,
"Durr, who pitched himself out",
of some tight situations all after,
"noon, did not allow an earned run.",Photo--Carl Jensen
"Catcher Scott Dow '81 takes a rip in the Bisons' 4-1 loss to Mansfield Wednesday. Dow, who has",
"surpassed the University career doubles record, has been the squad's leading hitter this",
spring.,
The Mansfield surge broke a 1-1,
deadlock which lasted seven in,
"nings, and upped the winner's",
record to 9-5.,
Monday's visit with Dickinson,
was a boost to morale after a,
Saturday clobbering by West,
Chester. Dickinson began the,
"scoring with a run in the second,",
but should have prayed for rain,
after that. The Bisons charged,
back in the bottom of the second,
when a Glenn Mattheis '83 triple,
brought home Jim Frantz '83 and,
CarlNablo'82.,
"With two out in the third, Scott",
"Dow '81 singled home one run,",
"and after a double steal, senior",
Captain Bill Lawrence singled,
home two more.,
Two runs were added in the,
sixth on a double by Paul Bam-,
"ford '83, and the batsmen capped",
their scoring in the eighth with,
singles by Bamford and junior,
Mika Palumbo and another Mat,
theis triple. Tom Ganter '81,
raised his record to 3-1 while,
Durr contributed two scoreless,
innings to end the day.,
While,
the,
Bisons,
were,
"creamed, 24-3, in the first game",
of Saturday's twinbill at West,
"Chester, the second game found",
"Bucknell in the ballpark, as the",
squad fell 3-2. Sophomore Ed,
Hughes pitched an excellent,
"game, which he might have won",
had the game not been called in,
the top of the eighth because of,
darkness.,
Bamford began and ended the,
Bucknell attack with a two-run,
"homer in the first inning, but the",
Golden Rams upped their record,
to 14-3 with the sweep.,
Friday's defeat of Gettysburg,
was,
a,
see-saw,
battle,
until,
Bucknell shot the Bullets' hopes,
in the eighth. Dow initiated things,
"with a triple, and after two walks",
and a fielder's choice produced,
"one run, junior George Kangos",
"singled. An error was committed,",
as two more crossed the plate and,
the batsmen sent Gettysburg to,
the showers with a 74 victory.,

Psychology professor is,

WEIL In a move reminiscent of the Stuart Rothenberg case a year ago, a visiting professor of psychology here has been passed over inher bid for a tenure-track job in favor of another candidate who was originally not one of the department's final four choices. . . . Although Nancy Cain enjoyed a substantial amount of student s p^ nort and was originally fourth on her departments list of top preferences for the position, the job was offered to another woman not on that list after the top choice for the psychology slot declined the U The membereof the Department ofPsychology vot^^anim ousiy during Spring Break to offer the job instead to Nancy Caine a -  ac- position along with more than 100 other applicants. P The job had first been offered to Judith G ibbons- a popi^tion con trol researcher at the University of St. Louis -- but she turned tne offer down March 25 to the "" !surprise"" of Keen.

"" There appears to be some question among certain members of the faculty about whether the program Is sufficiently academic,""  according to Professor of Biology Hulda Magelhaes, who is chairing the subcommittee of the Curriculum Com mittee of the College of Arts and Sciences that is making the evaluation. "" In part, this stems from the fact that dance has no real home in any department here,"" Magelhaes said.

Faculty debates writing proposal;English dept.split,By
LISA CERUTI,"The University faculty opened debate on the controversial proposal for a University writing program Monday, hotly debating the spirit and substance of the plan but failing to begin to vote on any of its dozen parts. After University Committee on Instruction Chairman Joseph LaBarge presented the first motion of the 12-part plan for school-wide writing education before the 90 members gathered for the special faculty meeting, 16 professors rose to comment on the program, with those speaking evenly split in their opi nion about the plan's merit. Of the nine members of the English depart ment who made speeches on the motion -- which presumably would have profound ef fects on the tenor and structure of the depart ment if effected -- five were in favor and four opposed. But although LaBarge asserted in his open ing remarks that "" major changes recom mended by departments""  in a formal solicita tion had been included in a revised document, acting English Department Chairman Dennis Baumwoll said "" the issues addressed in the revisions did not strike at the essential con cerns some of us had."" Baumwoll said he and other members of the department are "" left with a lack of clear definition""  of the three stages of writing courses that would constitute the hub of the proposed program. "" The feasibility of the program is questionable, particularly the vagueness of the kind of faculty participation that will be necessary,""  he said. On the other hand, Associate Professor of English Philip Withim, a member of the In struction Committee, told the faculty Bucknell still "" owes its students a coherent program to teach students how to write effec tive prose."" . Professor of History and English Michael Payne opposed the proposal, saying the first and second-level courses described are similar to courses currently offered. Payne compared the W1 courses to 100-level English courses and said the W2 curriculum "" looks familiar "" Courses which require term papers and essay exams--as stipulated in the description of W2 courses--are "" not necessarily courses in writing and I wouldn't want to pass them off as such,""  Payne said. Professor of English John Wheatcroft said the proposal "" is a wasteful, inefficient way to proceed.""  According to Wheatcroft, it is not very wise to institute "" requirements for graduation implemented by a staff (the pro posed Composition Council that would oversee the program) that will be voluntary and does not yet even exist. ' ' Other departments whose members voiced opinions included economics, civil engineer ing, political science and classics. Associate Professor of Economics Peter Kresl said it would be difficult for the economics depart ment to staff W3 courses. "" In departments with large numbers of majors, it will be dif ficult to come up with seven sections of 25 students and work within the system,""  Kresl said. LaBarge said Wednesday "" the debate at the meeting Monday was precisely what I had expected.""  The public debate is scheduled to continue Monday afternoon."

Group plans campaign to,
coincide with Klan visit,"By JEFF CROSS A group of students, faculty members and Lewisburg residents, con cerned about the Ku Klux Klan's planned appearance here May 9, for mulated tentative plans this week for a literature campaign and a public march to coincide with the visit. The group, United Against The Klan, plans to print and distribute 5,000 pamphlets containing the history of the Klan, morals-raising questions and sources of anti-Klan information, group member Britt Clayton '81 said. Plans call for a non-violent rally in Lewisburg with speakers, poetry readings and singing-- whether or not the members of the Klan ap pear to solicit new members the second Saturday in May-- according to Clayton. A discussion of "" the nature of a non-violent demonstration"" was led by Assistant Professor of Economics Charles Sackrey at noon today. Those at the workshop "" discussed the importance of non-violence at a public rally to ensure a peaceful gathering,""  Sackrey said. The publicity campaign, to be funded by contributions from students and Lewisburg residents, is also in the offing. Official plans will be resolved by the group at 8 p.m. Monday at the First Baptist Church of Lewisburg . Having a set agenda will help us stay together and prevent confrontations with the Klan,"" Rick Laboda '04 said. United Against The Klan drew 38 campus and Lewisburg residents to an organizational meeting Monday at the First Baptist Church, and more than 200 students and faculty attended an April 10 meeting in Walls Lounge of the University Center concerning the then-scheduled April 11 appearance of the Klan for a membership drive. Klan officials cancelled the appearance that day, however, when they were told it would coincide with the Black Arts Festival. By CINDY WARMAN In a reversal of official school policy, the Univer sity Committee on Complementary Activities voted unanimously Wednesday to prohibit the possession or use by students of any firearms on campus. The new rule--which is expected to be routinely approved by the office of the president--would pro hibit firearms "" including but not limited to rifles, handguns, guns, bows and arrow, slingshots or ex plosives, including fireworks and dynamite. The former policy allowed for both possession and use of firearms if they were properly registered by Campus Security and stored by the Department of Military Science. The proposal to change the policy came from Associate Director of Residential Life Gerald Com merford, who said the old policy was inadequate since it assumed that the now-defunct rifle range under the stands of Memorial Stadium would be available for the storage of firearms. Since the range is closed, there is no facility on campus for the safe storage and use of weapons, Commerford said. According to Commerford, without the use of the range for storage, he has stored students' ammuni tion in his office during this year. Although he has searched for an alternative storage area, Commerford said Campus Security has insufficient space for such a responsibility and the Military Science department does not want to get involved with student weapons. Commerford said rarely have more than 10 students registered weapons so there has never been much of a problem. Under the new policy, if students are found in violation, they will be dealt with in accordance with University disciplinary procedures listed in the Student Handbook. Any deviation from the rules will be reported, Commerford said, since more than two-thirds of students live in supervised residence halls. Activities such as the fencing club would not be af fected by the policy since their events are super vised and the swords are properly stored. If a suffi cient location for the storage and use of firearms is found, the use of weapons for that purpose will once again be allowed. Committee Chairman Bill Thum '82 said "" the new policy allows flexibility in prohibiting firearms on campus unless sufficient supervision and secure storage is available."""

Members of junior class are inducted,
into honorary Mortar Board Society,"Thirty juniors were inducted into the University's chapter of Mortar Board, the national scholarship, leadership and service honorary society in Hunt Hall Tuesday. More than 300 students were originally eligible for membership based on the 3.0 grade point average requirement for students in their junior year. An ap plication was mailed to these candidates requiring completion of an activities and interest sheet along with a faculty recommendation. Chapter President Glenn Tullman '81 said all students fulfilling the grade point requirement were considered and that completion of the application only serves to supplement previous knowledge of the prospective members. This year, two of the in ductees were chosen without a completed applica tion, Tullman said. "" Although scholarship, leadership and service are requirements for membership, service is the primary quality that is stressed in the selection pro cess,"" Tullman said. Mortar Board activities include sponsorship of the Last Lecture Series in which a professor is asked to speak as if it will be the last lecture he will give, Tullman said. This semester, Professor of English John Wheatcroft will lecture on the topic of "" Good-bye to Good-bye Mr. Chips""  at 7:30 p.m. May 6 in the University Center Forum. The undergraduates who were inducted are: Scott Armacost, Katherine Bittner, David Bresticker, Melissa Campbell, Susan Cardillo, Jeffrey Crossland, Pat D'Agostini, Jill Derderian, Pamela Ecock, Audrey Fessler, Stu Gay, Kevin High, Kathryn Kelley, Michael Kelly, Anne Kennedy, Kent Kester, Laurie Kochanek, Jan Krout, Stephen Rusher, Joseph Lee, David O'Connell, Dodie Rip- pon, Diane Schurr, Sara Sterner, Michael Suarez, Scott Thistle, Bill Thum, Susan Weinberg and Mari Anne Werson."
Caine hired to fill psychology position,"From CAINE, page 1. two students who were on cam pus and asked that they listen to the colloquium. Keen said this was "" irregular""  but "" those were the only students we could find."" According to Keen, Cain was the best qualified in the students' opinions but "" colleaguiality, research and teaching ability"" are also important and "" students do not have all the data that we have. Student opinion was not ig nored."" But, "" My main concern has been with my students,""  Cain said. "" The students felt their opi nions were not seriously con sidered. What has helped me in the classroom has probably hurt me professionally. I ' m an outspoken person and have a strong personality."" Cindy Jessen '81, who was one of the students who reviewed the original three applicants, said she "" doesn't think student input had any effect on the decision."" Students who volunteered to participate in the review process heard the colloquiums presented by Cheal, Veaith and Gibbons. There were "" between four and six students""  at each presenta tion who submitted anonymous written evaluations of the can didates, Keen said. In addition, students submitted an "" estimated 12 papers signed by two to three people each"" which recommended Cain and were placed in her file, Keen said. Keen said the four candidates were "" rated on the basis of students' evaluations and our own."" The opening in the department became available last summer when Professor of Psychology Alan Leshner, who was on a leave of absence since September 1979, decided not to return. Cain has been a visiting pro fessor since 1979."

gets guaranteed member,"From VETO, page 1. on the general election ballot only after special vote - by - proxy ar rangements were approved by the house. The ABS Constitution requires two-thirds of the voting member ship to approve of any proposed amendment while attending a regular congress meeting before the proposal can be passed on to the student body for a referen dum. But a quorum and sufficient support for the two amendments were lacking at the congress meeting April 13, prompting ABS President Michael Suarez '82 to ask congressional permission for the Steering Committee to con duct telephone balloting of those members officially excused from the meeting. The Castle amendment, which had 18 "" yes"" votes in congres sional session, and the Brody amendment, which had 22, were then given the required support by those casting ballots by proxy. Twenty-eight votes were re quired for approval of each. Suarez said the benefit of using the "" in absentia"" votes outweigh ed the problems of members voting without first hearing debate during a meeting. In each case there was a time constraint that forced action to be taken to enable the questions to appear on Wednesday's ballots, Suarez said. A s e c o n d a m e n d m e n t presented by Brody calling for an annual schoolwide vote on the Ap propriations Committee's budget was defeated, also after "" in absentia"" voting. The proposal would have allowed a majority vote by the student body to veto the proposed budget. "" The money belongs to the students, not the Appropriations Committee, and the students should have a say in how it is us ed,"" Brody said. Arguments against the pro posal centered on suggested bureaucratic difficulties and the current existence of a method to appeal decisions. Suarez said a referendum could be dominated by a relatively small group of people. He said ap propriations involve complex procedures, and there could be difficulty in both getting an in formed public and enough students out to vote. ABS Vice President Missy Campbell '82 said the alternative of an open forum where questions concerning the budget could be raised by students would be more feasible than a public referen dum. Suarez and Brody said such an open forum on the budget was very possible. "" In a student government so concerned with apathy, this is an unfortunate turn of events for a participatory dem ocracy,"" Brody said after defeat of his pro posal."
David Polsky '81 (left) and Howard Manley '81 (right) look on as Steve Grove '81 (center) casts,

University Center. The voting tables were open from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Wednesday when stu,
"dents could vote for members-at-large and sophomore, junior, senior and alumni officers.",
High voter turn-out sets record,"From HIGH, page 1. University Center had also been heavily trafficked, she said, and a total of 1050 students went to the polls. In the campus-wide election for ABS Congress members - at - large, junior Todd Buchholz was reelected with 705 votes, the highest total of the 12 candidates in the running for the eight slots. Rashid Ashraf '82 was also reelected for a third term as an at-large member with the third highest vote total, while Bill Thum '82 finished second with 675 votes. Also elected were sophomores Susan MacDonald and David Tyler and freshmen David Grossman, Christina Kounelias and Dan Huck. These congress members -- who comprise the bulk of the powerful ABS Appropriations Committee -- will take office in September. The most hotly contested class - officer election was for president of the Class of '84, with freshman Bob Fessler defeating Steve Gar- finkel by eleven votes out of 332 cast. Scooter Hoemer won reelec tion as vice president of the class unopposed, while Susan Stanley won 60 percent of the vote in defeating Helayne Sherman for secretary - treasurer. More than 43 percent turned out to vote for senior class of ficers, with Class Vice President David Flinchbaugh defeating both Mike Palumbo and David Hawkings for the presidency with 49 percent. Luanne Savino beat write-in candidate Patricia Out- man with 67 percent, while Nancy Weaver was chosen unopposed for the secretary - treasurer's post. In the only contested race for an officer for the Class of '83, George Tsougarakis took the presidency over Barbara Fedele. and Lon Castle with 48 percent of the votes cast. Forty-one percent of the sophomores also elected Anne Maher as vice president and Gail Post as secretary- treasurer in uncontested races. The lowest turnout was mustered by the current senior class, with less than 5 percent voting for four people unopposed in their quest for offices of the alumni class. Ray Monasterski, Eric Hoemer, Carol Christie and Bath Battin were all given the nod to lead the class's alumni ac tivities."

Women's Issues Group will present,
"a teach-in on sex, politics and fun","By NANCY KERVIN In an effort to make men and women aware of sexism, the Women's Issues Group of the Bucknell Progressive Caucus is sponsoring a teach-in, April 27-30, entitled "" Sex, Politics, and Fun: The Roles of Women in the 80s. The teach-in is scheduled to begin with noted feminist author Pauline Bart, a professor of Sociology at the University of Illinois, who will speak on "" Rape and Sexism"" at 7:30 p.m. Monday in Olin Science Auditoriom. A panel discussion will follow moderated by teach-in co-coordinator Laura Kinney '81 and including Bart, assistant Professor of Sociology Kim Scheppele, Lynne An- dreades '81 and Vemitia Shannon '81. A professional improvisational theatre troupe from New York will present the political satire Wax Dux, which delves into many feminist issues, 7 p.m. Tuesday evening in Coleman Hall. The teach-in will end at 7:30 Thursday with a presentation on sexual harassment in the home, school and workplace in Olin Science Auditorium. Helen Koschoff, assistant attorney general in the Pennsylvania Commission for Women, and Presi dent of Human Services Management Associates Faith Howarth will lead the discussion. Andreades, also a co-coordinator of the teach-in, said the purpose is to discuss the attitudes of sex ism on campus. "" These issues include the offensive way women are portrayed on the T-shirts printed by Third Kress this year, the sexist way women are por trayed on fraternity party ads and the insensitive and offensive attitudes towards women in 'The Bucknell Dilemma,' > a weekly cartoon strip feature of the Bucknellian, Andreades said. Third Kress resident John Held '84 said "" Women have an archtypical inferiority complex that is inevitably brought out by things such as the T-shirt--this feeling is not something we are responsible for."" "" It's a shame people who are so fanatical about certain issues often let obsessions interfere with a sense of humor. The "" Dilemma"" is not meant to offend anyone,"" "" Bucknell Dilemma"" author Steve Diorio '82 said. The Women's Issues Group was started specifically to organize the teach-in, but members are planning to reactivate some of the programs of the now-defunct Women's Concern Group, an organization, which suffered from student apathy and ceased to exist last semester, teach-in co coordinator Nina Kaminsky '81 said."

"What's antithetical, unjust and legal?",
By Phil Andrews,"Tragedy on a mass scale is a characteristic of our time. In Kampuchea, genocide and starva tion eliminated two to three million people be tween 1975 and 1979. And now in East Africa, more than a million will starve unless emergen cy food relief reaches them. Yet the human carnage in Kampuchea and East Africa differs significantly from the human tragedy and suffering in the Republic of South Africa. For in the land of Alan Paton's Cry, the Beloved Country, tragedy is institutionalized through apartheid. It is ""legal."" But ""legal"" only it is not. It is accelerating as well. The South African government is carrying"
PHILUNG,
IN,"apartheid to its logical conclusion -- the ter ritorial separation of blacks from non-blacks. They are accomplishing this by creating a ""na tional state"" for each of the 10 major South African tribes. Four have been established thus far: Transkei (1976), Bophuthatswana (1977), Venda (1979) andCiskei (1980). The South African government claims that these ""states"" conduct their own foreign policy. In fact, however, they are recognized by no state save South Africa. With economic dependency on their creator common to all, these ""homelands"" are more akin to reservations than to states. The homelands strategy has been accompanied by a much-heralded series of ""petty apartheid"" reforms (e.g., integration of sports, limited black trade union rights, et al.). Together they constitute a velvet-glove, iron-fist government attempt to consolidate white minority domina tion (18 percent) of the black majority (71 per cent). _ ,,  , Amid the turmoil of events in Iran, Poland and Central America, though, United States policy toward South Africa has received less attention than it merits. This is unwise. Apartheid is a morally repug nant law that for many black Africans and black Americans recalls painful memories of exploita tion by whites. For example, Nigeria -  which supplies 16 percent of the U.S.'s imported oil - uses its exports to influence recipient states' sup port for majority rule in Namibia and for the abolishment of apartheid. Unfortunately, U.S. rhetorical condemnation is more than offset by U.S. strengthening of the white-run South African economy. Furthermore, South Africa's location is excep tionally strategic. Eighty percent of Middle Eastern oil is shipped around the Cape of Good Hope. By tacitly bolstering the white supremacist government, the U.S. risks even tually ""losing"" South Africa. Or, the Soviet Union may gain influence with the black majori ty, and successfully portray the U.S. as an enemy of the oppressed. For these reasons, the U.S. should try to hasten the day of black majority rule, with white minority protection. A combination of skillfull U.S. diplomacy, coordinated U.S. and United Na tions economic sanctions and enlightened South African self-interest are necessary to realize a peaceful transition of power. As South Africa's major trading partner, and as the leader of the international economy, the U.S. in conjunction with other U.N. members can severely impair the South African economy. Apartheid is codified injustice, antithetical to U.S. and U.N. ideals. Woodrow Wilson once aptly prophesied, ""Unless justice be done to others, it will not be done to us."" U.S. policy toward South Africa should reflect the wisdom of Wilson's words. *"

Flying theme of yearly,
Lewisburg Arts Festival,"By ALLISON ABOUCHAR More than 60 professional and amateur artists will participate in the annual Indoor Art Show sponsored by the Lewisburg Council on the Arts as part of the Spring Arts Festival. The Indoor Art Show will officially open Thursday and run through May 10 in the Beaver Memorial Methodist Church on South Third Street. The theme of this year's festival is flying. Cash awards will be presented in both professional and amateur arts and crafts categories. A panel of professional artists from Lewisburg in cluding watercolorist Bradley Shoemaker, pen and ink artist Janette Campbell, and Molly Ross -- who is in charge of the University Craft Shop -  will judge the show. Other activities planned for the celebration include a Fantastic Flying Machine Contest, window displays, Outdoor Show and Sale, poetry reading and Kite Contest. The Fantastic Flying Machine Contest scheduled for May 2 will promote the theme of the festival by encouraging people to design and build contraptions that aviation pioneers might have imagined as they developed the modem jet plane. The Council on the Arts will present a $100 prize for the most fantastic invention. Chairman of the Flying Machine Contest Ed Miller said he hopes to involve Bucknell sororities and fraternities and he issued an in vitation to other area college groups to compete. Registration for the Flying Machine Contest, which will be held at Soldiers Memorial Park on North Water Street, has been extended until Tuesday because of a lack of entrants, according to General Chairman Marsha Scott Gori of Lewisburg. ""If there is no sizeable response at that time, the contest may have to be cancelled,"" she said. Downtown merchants will turn over their store windows for the artisans' window displays which will go up Monday. The Outdoor Show and Sale is also scheduled for Saturday from 9 i a.m. to 5 p.m. The area between Third and Fifth streets on Market Street will be blocked off for the event. Sponsored by the Lewisburg Chapter of the Pennsylvania Guild of Craftsmen, the Outdoor Show will include a variety of arts and crafts including pottery, stained glass, baskets and paintings -- all of which will be on sale. ""This year the outdoor part of the show is different because peo ple had to apply to get in,"" Gori said. ""Those accepted are usually people who earn a sizeable amount of their income through art,"" she added. Pigs will be roasted Friday evening at Soldiers Memorial Park, where a French Cafe will be hosted Saturday. Packwood House Museum, located at the park, will sponsor a display of artwork from area high school students. Music, theater and dance groups will perform on the festival stage in the Northern Central Counties Bank parking lot all day Saturday. A poetry reading including Professor of English Karl Patten, Associate Professor of English Robert Taylor and Professor of English John Wheatcroft will take place at the Valiant Trencher man Restaurant on Second Street at 8 p.m. May 4. The Kite Contest, which will officially ""fly the festival out,"" ac cording to Gori, will take place May 10 at the Little League Field on St. Anthony Street."
"Parton, Fonda and Tomlin provide light entertainment",
"man in a scene from ""Nine to",
"Five,"" which opens tonight at",
the Campus Theater.,"By DAVID BLACKMAN The light-hearted comedy ""Nine to Five,"" starring Lily Tomlin, Jane Fonda and Dolly Parton, opens at the Campus Theatre tonight, with show times at 7 and 9 p.m. The movie fails as a thematic film making a statement on male chauvinism in the workplace. It takes a serious situation that deserves realistic consideration and merely pokes fun at it. As a creative and entertaining work however, it most certainly succeeds. Set in a corporate office building, the film revolves around its three stars, all of whom hold secretarial positions in a giant conglomerate. They are stereotypically discrim inated against by the boss and -- eventually -- they decide to fight back. Their decision is solidified in a humorous scene in which the three women smoke marijuana and fantasize about killing the boss. In her film debut, Parton gives an equitable performance as the boss' sexy but naive secretary. Her comic timing is good, but her lack of movie experience becomes noticeable in moments when she looks less than at ease on screen. Fonda does well with an often simple script, but certainly her role is in no way challenging to her vast talent. The best performance of the three is given by Tomlin who, through her mistaken belief that she did in fact kill her boss, sets the major comic action in motion and keeps it rolling. The talented supporting cast includes Dabney Coleman and Elizabeth Wilson. Some surprising turns in the action -- and the hit song by Parton which brought the film an Academy Award nomination -- combine with the aura of three major stars to produce a very amusing, though by no means intellectual evening in front of the Art-Deco silver screen."

Softball falls,
to Seton Hall,
and Delaware,"By S.J. FURMAN Saturday's games proved disheartening on two courts for Terrie Grieb's Bucknell Women's softball team. First came a loss to Seton Hall 5-1, and then Delaware dropped the Bisons, 3-1. Both games were extremely close, but according to Grieb, the absence of power hitting and precise fielding led to Bucknell's defeats. Despite the unfavorable results, Grieb said she was "" pleased"" with both per formances. "" The errors were there, but what really killed the Bisons was a lack of hitting,""  she said. In the first contest against Se ton Hall, Bucknell was held to q mere two hits. Leading batter Jackie Crump '83 was held hitless throughout both games. By the 7th inning the score was tied 1-1. But the Pirates--currently 14-1- 1--scored four quick runs to pro vide the winning margin. Cindy Connelly '84 was praised by Grieb for her outstanding per formance on the mound. Connelly did an "" excellent job""  for 17 in nings as she gave up a total of 15"
Men,
'strack team fares,
poorly in pair o f meets,"By ROBERT BURNEY Count the men's track team among the ever-growing clique of Bucknell athletic teams whose memories of New Brunswick, N.J. this spring will be far from memorable. The thinclads were able to put forth only a mediocre per formance at the Rutgers Relays last Saturday, as they were unable to place anyone in meet events. One bright spot for the Bisons during the unscored meet, however, was sophomore Glenn Gibney, whose time of 30:21.8 in the 10,000 meter run qualified him for the IC4A Championship. The team fared only somewhat better Saturday at the Penn State Invitational, finishing fourth out of five teams. Gary Bartlett '82 turned in the team's best in dividual performance by setting a Bucknell record in the discus event with a toss of 140 feet 4 in ches. Other good performances in cluded junior Martin Carter's wind-aided 10.67 seconds in the 100 meters, Mike Ward '82's 49 feet 1% inches in the shot put, Ted Lewis '83's triple jump of 46 feet IV4 inches, and senior A1 Wegener's javelin throw of 203 feet. The host Nittany Lions won the Invitational with a score of 131%, followed by Fairleigh Dickinson (107), Slippery Rock (36%), Bucknell (32) and Clarion State (5). Photo--Carl Jensen"

ups season mark to 8-10,"The Bisons split their two games with East Coast Conference oppo nent Rider Saturday, losing 8-0 in the first game but winning 5-4 in the second. In the opener Rider's All-ECC pitcher Dave Malloy held Bucknell to only three hits and faced only one batter more than the minimum in shutting out the Bisons on his home mound. Ed Hughes '83 suffered the loss, dropping his record to 1-2, while Jim Smith '84 pitched 5% strong innings of three-hit ball for the Herd. The second game was a different story, however, as the batsmen triumphed 5-4 in 11 innings. Rider broke on top, leading 4-1 after three innings. Senior Captain Bill Lawrence '81 scored Bucknell's run in the second inning after leading off with a single. The Bisons tallied twice in the fourth, making the score"
4*3.,"With Lawrence on after an error, Glenn Matthais '83 singled, Mike Palumbo '82 followed with an infield single to load the bases and George Kangos '81 singled in two runs. The score remained the same until the seventh as freshman Mark Glatz -- who replaced Tom Ganter '81 after 2% innings -- held the Broncos in check. In the seventh, the Bisons tied the game at 4-4. Jim Eick '82 and Paul Bamford '83 opened with singles and, after a double play advanced Eick to third, a passed ball allowed him to score. Ken Durr '82 replaced Glatz with one out in the eighth after Glatz hurled 4% hitless innings, but the Broncs retaliated by bringing in Malloy again. Both pitchers shut down their opponents, with Malloy hurling his 10th and Uth scoreless innings of the day before he was pulled for a pinch- hitter in the bottom of the ninth. In the top of the eleventh, the Bisons went on top for the first time all day. After two quick outs, Eick singled and Bamford -- the team RBI leader -- cracked a double to left-center, scoring Eick. Durr held the Broncos to up his record to 2-4 and the team's record to 8-10. The Bisons traveled to Penn State yesterday for a double-header and visit Lafayette tomorrow for another twinbill. _____________________ By JEANNE MIN AH AN By scoring victories over Bloomsburg, 77-66, and Messiah, 77-16, on Bison turf Tuesday, the women's track team upped its record to 2-1. If the meet is a forecast of future races, the Bisons have a promis ing season ahead as they took nine first places, five seconds and eight thirds. The victory was "" a real accomplishment,""  ac cording to tri-captain Linda Accettura '82. "" We lost to Bloomsburg last year so everyone was psyched to win."" Sophomores Lonnie Fertik and Beth Bittel were both double winners for Bucknell. Fertik captured the 100-meter hurdles in 15.0 seconds and the high jump with a leap of 5-1.125 feet. Bittel placed first in the discus (113-8) and shot put (37-8.5) and also set a new school record in the javelin with a toss of 104-6, although she did not place in that event. The Bisons dominated the sprints as Nancy Russo '84 won the 220-yard dash (61.2) and Accettura cap tured the 880-yard run (2:25.6).

Julia Vaughters '84 -- who "" has been making a strong showing in the meets thus far,""  according to coach Diane Ware -- was second at 100-meters in 13.1 seconds. Classmate Sue Ladany was second in the 440-yard dash and third in both the 100-meter hurdles and high jump. Accettura, Bittel, Fertik, Hecker, Nicholoson, Russo and Vaughters were joined by sophomores Laurie VanWyck, Laura Gaydos and Katrina Bikis in the Penn Relays Thursday.

The Mudsharks defeated three opponents in State College Saturday and Sun,
day to win the State Championship for the first time in three years.,"ByRICHSCHABERG The Bucknell ultimate frisbee team won the State Championship last weekend by remaining undefeated against four other area teams in a two-day tournament at Penn State featuring the six best teams in Pennsylvania. Although Bucknell had not won the State Cham pionship in two years, last weekend's performance demonstrated that the Mudsharks remain a regional frisbee power. Saturday's games were played in harsh windy conditions which disrupted most teams' offensive coordination and made scoring difficult. But despite the restric tions imposed by the weather, Bucknell maintained an effective offense and was quite successful in its scoring attempts. As the day progressed, it became clear that the discmen would dominate all of their games. As Stalio Boyd '81 said: "" Despite our dissheveled and unorganized appearance, we fielded a first class team."" The first game was a close match, with the wind hampering the play of both teams. In the second half, however, Bucknell effectively shut down the Philadelphia Frisbee Club's offense and repeatedly turned interceptions and block ed passes into scores. Although PFC was seeded first in the tournament, Bucknell won 12-9. Bucks County and Penn also suffered losses at the hands of Bucknell Ultimate, 14-4 and 11-4 respectively. Opening against Bucks, Bucknell scored six unanswered goals before the opponent called a timeout. Bucknell's zone defense was outstanding, with the losing team barely mustering an offense. See MUDSHARKS, page 14."
"Golfers take 1st, 2nd",
at Bucknell invitational,"By JACK SNYDER The surging golf team enjoyed a winning week highlighted by a sweep of first and second places at the 1981 Bucknell Invitational. Both the Bisons and unseasonably chilly weather played grim hosts to the invitational field of Army, Bloomsburg, Lock Haven and St. John's. But the cool breezes and 40-degree temperatures prevalent during Monday and Tuesday's tourney proved no hin drance to Coach Jeff Ranck's linkmen. Senior captain Rob Wagner led the Orange team to a decisive vic tory by turning in two 18-hole rounds of 73-77 on the par 70 Bucknell course, for a combined score of 150. Following Wagner was a close pack of teammates--Kevin High '82, Peter Orr '84, Bill Francis '83 and Jeff Buley '82--who turned in scores of 155,156,157 and 171. Bucknell's Blue team placed second and was led by Bob Craig '83 with a round of 154, followed by Mike Stoyla '82 and Rick Cramer '82, both at 155. Steve McFarland '82 and John Stasko '83 rounded out the Blue team's scoring, posting 162 and 168 respectively . The overall tournament results showed Bucknell dominating first and second spots, with the Orange team having a stroke total of 618 followed by the Blue team at 626. Wagner's round of 150 led the field of 30 golfers as the Bison cap tain grabbed the individual low medalist trophy. Other individual finishes were Craig in fourth place, and Stoyla, Crammer and High tied for fifth. According to Francis, ""the win was really satisfying considering the rough start we had. Both the Orange and the Blue teams played well, proving that we can all play good consistent golf over a two- day tournament, which will give us confidence for the upcoming ECC s."" The East Coast Conference Championship will be played in Elkton, Md., Monday and Tuesday. Saturday's tri-match was also a confidence builder. On the friendly home turf of the University's course, the Bisons bested Lafayette and West Chester. Orr led the Bisons with a one-over- | par round of 71, followed by teammates Stasko and Wagner, both at 75, and High and Buley at 77 and 78. # :"

The Bisons' comeback was initiated by an amaz ing goal by freshman Dave Brumbaugh, who managed to scoop the ball into the goal out of a crowded scramble in the dust in front of the Lehigh net. The Bison offense soon began to take charge again, and sophomore John Alexander scored to deadlock the game at 14. A Lehigh penalty set the stage for victory, as Rink Smith '83 fired home what proved to be the winning goal with 5:14 left to play. The laxmen added an insurance goal minutes later as Rob Mathai '82 fed Smith who slammed the ball into the net once again to seal the score at 16-14 Jamieson said he was pleased with the improve ment of the offense. "" We decided to go back to our basic offense. We had been trying some different things, but we were throwing the ball away too much, so it was back to the basics."" >> Morris and Smith were the offensive leaders for the game, with four and three goals respectively. Goalie Stu Berger '81, who turned away 18 Lehigh shots, was cited by Jamieson for a commendable ef fort. The Bisons raised their season record to 3-6, while Lehigh dropped to 3-7.

The Bisons, who outshot the Engineers 26-14 dur ing the first half, were sparked by the offense of Junior Tri-Captain John Morris, who scored three of the first five Bucknell goals.

Bucknell was in the penalty situation three times and Lehigh capitalized with a goal every time. Coach Sid Jamieson attributed the Bisons' third quarter troubles to Lehigh's maintaining dominant control of the ball and keeping the Bison otiense from getting untracked. Jamieson also cited the three damaging penalties as a contributor to the third-quarter lapse. He said he was "" surprised"" that the Herd gave up as many goals as they did, but he cited the young defense as the primary reason. same."

Rooney packs gym,
with speech on the,
uses o f language,"By MARY LISA MURGIANO More than 1500 students, faculty and area residents packed Davis Gymnasium to hear CBS news writer and producer Andy Rooney speak on "" The Uses of the English Language"" Tuesday"
night.,
",",
. ..,
.. .,"Sporting a "" Bison"" necktie given to him that evening, the "" 60 Minutes"" pundit balanced a sense of humor with the seriousness of his talk as he discussed -- among other things what he con sidered to be the superiority of the English language despite its frequent misuse. According to Rooney, English is the most democratic and most concise language but is not perfect. "" How can a language that's perfect spell a word c-o-l-o-n-e-1 and pronounce it kernel?"" he ask ed. . Although Rooney said there is "" no doubt about the decline of the English language,"" he said foreigners who choose to move to the United Slates should "" drop their native language in exchange for the benefits of our country."" Rooney prefaced a criticism of "" Black English by saying, "" If there is anyone I haven't yet offend ed, I will offend them personally afterwards.""  He called black English "" an insult to blacks -- the im plementation of the language implies that they're not smart enough to speak English."" The second half of Rooney's hour-long speech con cerned writing for television. "" I can write for televi sion because there is a limit. I'm not overwhelmed. It's strange that more established writers don't want to share their words with pictures,"" Rooney said. He also attributed a shortage of television writers to the popularity of the more attractive jobs of television producers. "" A producer receives more money and status for easier, less creative work,"" he said."

CBS News writer and producer Andy Rooney,
Tuesday night in Davis Gymnasium. Rooney,
mixed humor and seriousness in the final,
speech of the Class of '53 Lectureship.,"The humorous columnist commended former CBS News President Richard Salant with standing up to top executive and "" forcing them to respect the news.""  Rooney said Salant has worked hard to keep the news division of CBS autonomous. Salant was one of the first speakers along with former CBS Vice Chairman and President Frank Stanton February 26 in the Class of '53 Lec tureship, and he has been the driving force behind the acquisition of speakers for all four programs in the lectureship. Rooney's appearance was originally scheduled for the University Center Forum. _________________ By JANET WILLIAMS Two surveys intended to deter mine the University's priorities and goals for the upcoming decade and to plan for the University's multi-million dollar capital campaign have been distributed to students, members of the faculty and administration and the University's Board of Turstees. Chairman of the Campaign Planning Committee and Pro fessor of Mathematics David Ray said his group's Survey on Ex isting Needs was conducted because the committee is "" trying to pull together a needs list for the upcoming fund-raising cam paign."" According to Ray, the 17-item survey -- sent to more than 300 members of the faculty and ad ministration and the ABS Steer ing Committee -- was derived from two reports distributed by President O'Brien: a 1981 draft report of the Committee on Priorities for the '80s and a 1975 document on academic needs. The questionnaire asks that respondents evaluate the desirability of 16 diverse items such as new residence halls, an addition to the Ellen Clarke Ber trand Library and endowment for faculty salaries. An additional question asks for a description of any University-wide depart mental or professional needs not covered elsewhere in the survey. The other survey--which was sent to students, members of the faculty, administration and board of trustees--is designed to "" evaluate the interests and aspirations of students, faculty and staff"" and "" establish our priorities and goals for the com ing decade,"" University Presi dent Dennis O'Brien said in a let ter accompanying the survey. Provost Wendell Smith, a member of the committee who orignally suggested that such a proposal be conducted, said all the responses have not yet been returned. Smith said die com pleted surveys will be sent to ETS in about 10 days and "" hopefully returned within two to three weeks."" Chairman of the Committee on Priorities and Professor of Psychology Roger Tarpy said after ETS has scored and evalu ated the results, the groups "" will try to write a preliminary report this summer"" and possibly pre sent it to the trustees at their fall meeting. According to Ray, the responses to the Campaign Plan ning survey will not be tallied un til after May 10. After the results are evaluated by the committee, a report will be presented during an open forum."
[Faculty takes first steps in passing writing proposal,"I i * * t n -- A 0 0 0  rti n D w a ^ a c o a i * a I R a l l d l A n S F I f l By LISA CERUTI The University faculty passed the first to parts of the 12-part proposal for a University - wide writing program by re- | sounding voice votes Monday, setting the stage for the adoption of the rest of the j plan's points this week. After the heated and evenly split first debate on the controversial plan the I week before, the overwhelming approval for the writing curriculum from the 80 voting faculty present at the special faculty meeting Monday came as a sur prise to many. And it helped the plan | clear an important psychological hurdle that those close to the debate think the writing program's opponents -- most j noticeably from the Department of English -- will have a difficult time rebuilding. Chairman of the Faculty David Ray said he doesn't see a shift in the number of faculty members who now support the j proposal as compared to the number at the beginning of the debate. "" The people who speak out are always the same ones but we can never tell how those who re- main silent will vote."" Chairman of the Committee on Instruc tion, Joseph LaBarge, agreed, and said he "" expects that things will go more quickly with the remaining motions than they did with the first one. "" The rest should fall in place now,""  he said: Although the motions that would create the program and its administration are being voted on individually, the faculty does still have the option to reject the en tire plan once the debate and ballotting on each of the dozen parts is finished. The first motion passed calls for the establishment of a University - wide writing program and stipulates that in order to graduate, each student must complete the program by passing one writing course in each of three categories. There was still some diehard opposi tion to this motion from at least six facul ty members, with the English professors still divided over the issue. Some reiterated the arguments presented at last week's meeting. Professor of Eng lish and History Michael Payne called it "" an abstraction in the worst sense which doesn't speak to the specific needs of Bucknell."" Professor of Mathematics and Astronomy Emil Polak questioned his own ability to evaluate an essay and said he foresees a problem if professors who teach the writing courses are not trained in such instruction. Associate Professor of English Philip Withim, a member of the Instruction Committee, defended the proposal in' < response to Polak's question. "" Writing instruction cannot be handled by the English department alone -- anyone who can teach writing, should,"" Withim said. Assistant Professor of Chemical Engineering and Assistant Professor of English Catherine Smith, two other com mittee members, joined Withim in lobby ing for the motion from their position in the front row of the University Center Forum, where the group has sat en masse during the debate. Associate Professor of Religion and Coordinator of Graduate Studies William Becker moved to amend the first part of the proposal by eliminating the require ment for every student to pass one course in each of three categories, but the amendment was defeated by voice vote. The second part of the proposal was passed after little debate and one motion to amend it was made. Associate Pro fessor of English John Murphy moved that each Department or Major be re quired -- rather than asked, as stated in the proposal -- to develop one or more courses in the writing program. Although the amendment was sup: ported by Professor of Political Science and Religion Douglas Sturm, University President Dennis O'Brien and others, Ray ruled that it was not in order since its nature required consideration and discussion prior to the meeting. Voting on the remaining ten motions of the proposal will continue Monday at the faculty's regularly scheduled monthly meeting %"

"Student clubs divide $74,386",
"O f 61 organizations, 10 appeal spring appropriation decision","| ^ j H | B u ckn ellian Editor David Hawkings '82 also said the newspaper would appeal the committee's "" in complete"" appropriation of $2,181 from the $10,583 requested. "" The paper generates 70 percent of its income from advertising and off-campus subscrip tions,""  Hawkings said, "" and the funds we requested should really be considered a student subscription rate of about $3.50 for the year."" "" I don't think that's too much to ask students to pay for a weekly newspaper of the Bucknellian's quality,"" he said. Brody said, however, that the final funding for the paper would almost certainly be increased after committee members had made another review of its salary expenses and capital improvement re quests. Other groups appealing include campus radio sta tion WVBU, the Tristram literary magazine, the Congress of Business Students, the French Club, the American Society of Chemical Engineers, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers and the Japanese Club. . _ , . Brody said although many groups were not The Bucknell Jazz and Rock Ensemble request _lease(j wjtj, tj,e cutSj the amount of funds available was cut from $5,074 to $1,000, and BJRE Manager severejy limits the committee's actions. While the John Stillman '81 said the group was "" rushed through its hearing. Brody said the committee didn't understand several points of the request as a result of the five-minute meeting. After cutting funds for our spring tour, they neglected to make the resulting cuts in anticipated revenues and thus we actually got a negative appropriation."" Another group appealing the decision is Current Concerns, formerly known as Interaction and Diversity. Treasurer Joanna DiMario '81 said, "" the committee makes cuts without understanding what the programs are for. The 10-minute presentation is a farce."""
BY BILL THUM,"Of the 61 clubs and organizations dividing close to $75,000 in the ABS Appropriations Committee's spring action last weekend, 10 groups are appealing the decision on their request. The committee -- which is charged with the distribution of the funds raised through the Student Activities Fee of $52 per student next year -- was forced to pare more than $50,000 from the $125,778 requested by campus groups. "" It was an enormous task to evaluate all of the re quests in light of the limited funds available for distribution,""  ABS Treasurer Andy Brody '82 said. "" Many believe the committee just sits down and makes decisions. Actually a lot of information gathering is done by all the members before the distribution process begins,"" he said. Although many of the organizations making ap peals expected cuts to be made, many of the club's leaders still said the committee's decisions reflect a lack of accurate information concerning the needs of specific programs The Bucknell Jazz and Rock Ensemble request severely limits the committee's actions. While the activities fee generates $161,200 and returns from the previous year add an additional $19,125, fixed allocations including the ABS scholarship, the Com mittee on Student Programs and support of the four classes remove $27,900. Fixed appropriations such as those for the Bucknell Student Lectureship, the ABS Jan Plan fund and the Committee on Student Programs deduct another $59,213 from the amoimt available to campus groups, Brody said. He said that with a total of $93,212 available for the spring hearings, the funds distributed leave only a $19,826 margin for ap peals and additional appropriations."

Wolf to succeed Ferguson,"From WOLF, page 1. The delay in the public announcement of Wolf's position with the University is being made "" in deference to his current employer,"" O'Brien said. Referring to Wolf only as the "" new vice president"" , O'Brien said he has "" current commitments""  that preclude formal an nouncement of his hiring until May 15. Sources said he has yet to make final his termination plans with Marts and Lundy. Wolf's first association with the University came when he served as a Marts and Lundy consultant from 1977-1979 while the firm was help ing Bucknell raise money in its $3.5 million fund drive for the Sports/Recreation Complex. Marts and Lundy will once again be serv ing as a consultant to the University during its $30-$50 million capital campaign for the 1980s, and several administration officials expressed pleasure at the prospect of a strong link between the firm and the University. O'Brien said several candidates for Ferguson's post were inter viewed here and in New York this spring, but this appointment has left him "" delighted."" Faced with a history of high turnover in this office -- three men have served as vice president for University Relations in the last four years -- O'Brien said he expected Wolf to remain in his post "" until his retire ment."" O'Brien said the University Relations office has been notified of the hiring, and several in the fundraising division said they were "" ex cited"" by the announcement. S(r)"

Richardson is named editor of 1982,
VAgenda following staff selection,"Bobbie Richardson '82 was named editor of the 1982 L'Agenda following selection by the yearbook staff April 16. A native of Rowayton, Conn., Richardson was business manager of her high school yearbook, the Daege Eagle. She has no previous ex perience with L'Agenda but has done layout work as well as photography. _ . , , According to L'Agenda Editor Jim Zimmerman 81, Richardson was among six people considered for the position. The selection was made after Richardson's qualifications were reviewed by Zimmerman and the yearbook staff. ' , , , . .. "" I have some basic ideas about what changes I want to make in the yearbook but it's too early to say exactly what they'll be,"" Richardson said. . Richardson said she will meet with several publishers next month and will choose one for next year by the beginning of June. Although a number of students are being considered, no one has yet been offered a position on the staff, Richardson said. Next year's L'Agenda will be smaller than the 1981 edition, Richard son said. This year's book will be 520 pages-the largest yearbook ever published for Bucknell-according to Zimmerman. Richardson said she plans to publish about 470 pages, since a 50-page school history supplement which will be included in the 1981 book will not be available next year. ___________ ____"

During the committee's discus sion Wednesday, Professor of Chemistry Hans Veening said the support of a proposal to complete the third floor was in direct con flict with a recent survey distributed by the Administration to determine the priorities con cerning the University's up coming major capital campaign. Veening said the proposal should wait until the response of the evaluated determine if the third floor is of paramount importance. In response. O'Brien said the completion of the third floor does not represent a new priority but rather the fulfillment of one begun 10 years old. O'Brien said the developm ent of other priorities such as science laboratories would require exter nal funds whereas the third floor could be completed by an exten sion of the existing debt of $1.8 million on the University Center to $3.1 million to be paid off in 1992. ABS Treasurer Andy Brody '82 said the use of the third floor for museum facilities could not be justified, and would not be mak ing use of the full potential of the floor. Provost Wendell Smith said there were pressing reasons for the museum space on the third floor such as the present over crowding of the library partially caused by the Kress Gallery."

Haig contradicted,
by the White House,"In response to Secretary of State Alexander Haig's state ment that a total trade embargo would result from an invasion of Poland by the Soviet Union, White House officials said Mon day this was only one of many op tions. Haig said Saturday any inter nal or external aggression by the Soviet Union would result in an "" across-the-board"" trade cutoff. Haig's comments came the day after the Reagan Administration announced the end to the 15- month-old curb on grain exports to the Soviet Union. Haig had made no secret of his opposition to this position prior to its release."
U.S. criticized by,
Japanese official,"Japanese-American relations are in conflict resulting from the United States' failure to inform Japan of the end of the 15-month curb on grain shipments to the Soviet Union. Prime Minister Zenko Suzuki -- who will visit Washington next week -- criticized the United States for not asking Japanese of ficials about their views on the timing of the embargo lift. He said although Japan was in formed of the lift before action was taken, not enough time was given to coordinate any actions Japan may take on economic sanctions against the Soviet Union."
NATIONAL,
Reagan calls for,
passage of budget,"President Reagan appealed to a joint session of Congress Tues day night to approve his budget package of spending cuts and tax reductions as "" the only answer we have left""  to inflation and unemployment. The president advocated bipar tisan support for his budget pro posal, a plan that includes $689 billion in spending for the next year, a $38.9 billion deficit and an annual 10 percent personal in come tax cut for three years. Senate Budget Committee Republicans, who earlier were divided in their support for the president's budget plan, united Wednesday and sent the proposal to the Senate floor, where it is ex pected to be approved."
Agnew convicted,
for taking bribes,"Former Vice President Spiro Agnew was convicted Monday of receiving thousands of dollars in bribes from contractors while he was governor of Maryland. The judgment of bribery and call for restitution followed a five-year campaign by three Maryland taxpayers to reclaim money allegedly paid to Agnew by highway companies granted state contracts in 1967 and 1968. Judge Bruce Williams of the Anne Arundel County Circuit Court ordered Agnew to repay the state $147,500 in kickbacks, with interest of $101,235, for a total of $248,735. Agnew's lawyer said an appeal would be filed"

Lewisburg man held,
for attempted rape,"A 19-year-old Lewisburg man faces charges including attemp ted rape after he allegedly held a knife to a 20-year-old Lewisburg woman's throat and tried to rape her in the Washtubs Automatic Laundry, April 23. Gary Lee Strahan of 324 Market St. was arraigned Friday and Lewisburg police filed charges of criminal rape at tempt, unlawful restraint, ag gravated assault and recklessly endangering another person."
A,"com posite draw ing of Strahan led to the arrest. He is currently being held in Union County Jail in lieu of posting $25,000 bail. A hearing is schedul ed for May 6 before District Magistrate Leo Armbruster."
Therapy Director,
to speak on cancer,"Charlotte Gerson Straus, direc tor of the Gerson Therapy Center in Tijuana, Mexico, will speak on a treatment of cancer and degenerative diseases through nutrition in the University Center Forum at 7:30 p.m. Monday. Straus said the Gerson Center was established to cure people suffering from cancer and degenerative diseases through an intense detoxification and nutri tion program . The Gerson Therapy, which was developed by Straus' father, Dr. Max Ger son, was strongly supported by Dr. Albert Schweitzer, who underwent the therapy for ad vanced diabetes at age 75 and lived until he was 90."

Lyons Shop to close by June,"After 31 years in business, the Lyons Shop and its subsidiary Bath-A-Bed are expected to close by June 1. The owners, Robert and JoAnne Lyons, said their decision to close the shops at 318 and 320 Market Street was because of their in volvement in many other activities, including civic affairs. The Lyons said the store, which opened in May of 1950, was in tended to cater to the tastes of college students at Bucknell and Sus quehanna Universities. The shop was featured in a September 1961 Cosmopolitan article entitled "" How to Start a Little Dress Shop. The portion on The Lyon's Shop, entitled "" Know thy Neighborhood,""  recounted how the Lyons developed their business from the time of establishing the store to its initial, early successes. Mr. Lyons, a full-time instructor at Williamsport Community College and operator of a retail consulting business, declined to disclose plans for future use of the building. sent a lecture entitled "" Three M ile I s l a n d -- A P e r s o n a l Perspective""  in the Vaughan Literature Auditorium at 8 p.m. Tuesday. Stello is serving as director of the Office of Inspection and En forcement for the NRC. He played a major role as a senior NRC representative during the accident in Unit 2 of Three Mile , Island, in March 1979. Stello received both the bachelor of science and master of science degree in mechanical engineering from Bucknell. '-The lecture is a part of the Engineer - in - Residence pro gram which is being sponsored by the Bucknell Engineering Alumni Association."

Third floor encounter,
"At the risk of being premature, we must",
expre^,
our jubilation,
>> ',"the Unlvers,ty"
"""^ A U h o u ^ ^ ^ ^ o f^ w ^ im tb e ^ ro u n d  to experience U s << .  we",
can all leave happy with the knowledge that in some small way we,
helped to bring about its completion. But perhaps even more ^ P or',
tant than the UC's imminent maturity is this knowledge that a,
rather rare method of teamwork was used by the,
the formulation of a proposal which will permanently affect all of the,
members of the University community.,
"<<>>,,dents",
"From the beginning of the development of this plan, students,",
"faculty and administrators worked in concert, active^  giymg and",
taking to produce something acceptable -- if not available,
to all.,
"For too long, students and faculty leaders have bemoaned the",
lack of input which has existed in the formulation of University,
"policy, but clearly the spirit at the meeting of the University Com",
mittee for Planning and Budget Wednesday was one of mutual and,
"rather unexpected excitement; after all the talk and delay,, all had",
some say in this happy project.,
Like drowning men,
We're not sitting here this morning to take advantage of a,
somewhat unique opportunity we have to whine publicly about our,
not getting the funds from the student coffers we think we deserve.,
We understand why the ABS Appropriations Committee decided to,
"give us the "" incomplete"" partial funding of about one-fifth what we",
"had asked for, and we are confident that -- once they are given the",
proper information in a more relaxed setting -  they will respond by,
giving us at least close to the $3.50 subscription fee per student we,
think we are worth.,
J,
. fVlQ,
We are taking this opportunity to raise some concerns about the,
"nature of the appropriations process, though. These concerns should",
be made readily apparent by the phrase offset by dashes above;,
"namely, we think there's been both a lapse of proper information",
and,
a dirth of time for that information to be transferred.,
"The two, of course, are intimately connected. Given only 10 or 15",
"minutes to outline and answer queries on a year's budget, we are",
forced to feel like drowning men watching our life pass before our,
"eyes: we'd like to relive every moment again in its entirety, but",
there just isn't time.,
.,
Suggestions-if not solutions-for the alleviation of the problem,
"are many and complicated, and may involve an involved rethinking",
"of the process of "" passing the bucks"" -  more involved even than An",
dy Brody's already felicitous endeavours. But the process of divvy,
"ing up the $166,400 pie is something we're all already involved in.",
"Thinking theater, Part 2",
You walk into Political Science 150 and get barraged with the,
"ideals of Marx, Locke and Rousseau. The professor presents the",
ideas because they will help you to learn to think; the political views,
are secondary to the development of an ability to evaluate and ap,
preciate thoughts formerly foreign to your own.,
"A similar experience occurs in the theater. You relax, stretch",
"your mind and experience the ideas, emotions and events creatively",
and artistically portrayed for your reflection.,
"Which leads us to "" Minamata.""",
The controversy over whether to present Jeffry Walker's pro,
"jected play is a healthy one, for we wouldn't want Cap and Dagger to",
approve plays suggested for the Coleman main stage without first,
thinking about their place in the community. What is worrisome is,
that these decisionmakers don't have more faith in their own in-,
terests.,
""" Minamata""  is by its nature a political statement -- on that",
brings the viewer into confrontation with potentially controversial,
"views. Its value will not come from the performers' "" actual"" sup",
"port of the message, but rather from the performers' ability to con",
vey the notion for the viewer's quiet judgment. Clearly the synthesis,
"of talents in the creation of "" Minamata""  will provide a needed break",
and an enormous educational experience for those accustomed to,
merely interpretive theater:,

LETTERS,
A shining success is result of many,"To the Editor: The Handicap Awareness Week at Bucknell April 19-25 was a suc cess thanks to a ton of people. Focusing on the word "" success,"" if only one person became educated and aware--or if even one child's face shone on Kids' Day--the week in my eyes will have gone well beyond the word "" success."" I feel strongly that this in creased awareness was ac complished in a respectful, un sympathetic manner. I enjoy life and Bucknell and I am fighting for all who have physical and mental limitations so that they too can know the joy of life, if they do not know it now. People who learned will carry that spirit to others, and I will be working on more Handicap Awareness Weeks--here and elsewhere. We have the knowl edge to solve our problems if we have the will. This is our shining hope, and it begins with each of us. The most important reason for writing this letter was not only to talk of HAW's success, but to thank you all. I believe in giving credit when it s due, and it s over due here. Thanks go first to Betsy Fisher, who helped carry out my ideas. Also to Ruth Burnham, my advisor who did more than seemed humanly possible, and to Beth Sipple and Marina Pappas, who put their "" hearts""  into the event. I also thank the entire Con cern and Action gang, the ABS, and many other students, faculty and staff. Everyone's help is very much appreciated; without you, this event would never have oc curred. Karen Wark, '81 April 29,1981"
Jokers should consider their topic,"To the Editor: Once, there were several people who desired to write for the Bucknellian. Now they do not dare. Now there are some who hesitate to even answer fhirimpllian questions because one never knows what words will be twisted, added or omitted. Last week's issue had some surprise publicity about the Women's Issues Teach-In. The article that appeared was a long way from the author's original. To set the record straight: Laura Kinney said the words attributed to Nina Kaminsky. My words took the very convenient form of an accusation rather than a simple observation about this campus. The Bucknellian staff attached the sexist "" label"" to Steve Diorio's cartoon. I was referring to the in famous "" mock""  issue. Last year's masterpiece is preserved on microfilm. You can go to the library and drool over the "" tasteful""  verbal and pictoral caricatures of women. As a response to the "" equal coverage""  in this arti cle and to others who justify their behavior on the grounds that it is funny, I would like to point out that because people are not supposed to be offended by jokes, humor is a particularly subtle way of "" keep ing woman in her place."" Sig Derby provides a hilarious situation in which women degrade themselves and worship men. Kress T-shirts are a barrel of fun and the legs contest of Sig Derby causes uncontrollable laughter. While these individual phenomena may not carry immediate consequences, they create a climate ex pecting women to be the brunt of many jokes. What you choose to do in your spare time is political and what you choose to laugh at reflects your politics. The humor on this campus reflects an attitude which says women are available for men to judge, mock or play with, at will. P.S. I suppose the cure for the "" archtypical in feriority complex,""  the latest rare disease at tributed to women, is to subject ourselves to as much sexism as possible so we can build up an im munity and come to think of it as natural. Lynne Andreades '81 April 22,1981"
Sunrise service was,
a great joint effort,"To the Editor: I want to express my thanks to the representatives of all four Christian groups on campus who worked to prepare the successful Easter sunrise service April 19. The service was joyful, meaningful and in spirational, but also significant was the fact that all four groups could work together. Their unity was commendable, and I hope that this effort is only the first of many successful joint ef forts of Christians at Bucknell to work together as a whole for a common goal. BUI Kennedy'84 April 22,1981"
Sexist event challenged,"To the Editor: deg Sig Derby was supposed to be the start of a new era. Very reluc tantly, representatives from Sigma Chi agreed upon some changes so that the sororities would participate. The first major change the sororities asked for was on the Der by Chase. The amount of violence had grown to the point that Panhell felt that the event required major alterations to insure the safety of the pledges. Hours of work resulted in a compromise which included no points for derbies, referees and a penalty for violence. The second problem occurred with the skits. It was clearly stated that the sororities would not have to degrade and humUate themselves in order to win this event. It was decided that the skits would be replaced by a talent show and lewd actions would not be encouraged by Sigma Chi. These two concessions were quickly forgotten hours after they were agreed upon, by both Sigma Chi and the sororities. The Derby Chase was held as always, the referees having little effect on the violence. The "" Talent Show""  (the title accompanied by a laugh) turned out to be exactly the same as before. The only formal restriction was on criticism of other sororities. Sigma Chi still en couraged crude comments and suggestive, degrading behavior. It is about time sororities realize what they are doing. Eight groups of educated, liberated women are participating in a morally degrading and sexist event that fosters hard feelings between the sororities. I challenge the Panhellenic Council and the individual sororities to truly unite and change Sig Derby effectively into a more enjoyable campus event. Gail Lawson'82 April 28,1981"
What's in a name . . .  ?,"To The Editor: It is discouraging to see our stu dent leaders brush aside such abominations as spelling a per son's name incorrectly on an election ballot. My name ap peared on the election ballot for Alumni Class vice president April 22 spelled Monastergle. I mean, that isn't even close. I've accepted misspellings before. I've seen Monastersk, Monski and sometimes Monas- terski, in which case I usually throw a major party and turn as green as my pants. So I can ac cept misspellings; we ethnics have come to accept this in a world full of Smiths and Whites and Halls. What is bothersome is the lack of preparation on the part of the"
ABS,"Steering Committee in preparing a simple things such as an election ballot. How can an organization attempt to be effec tive when they can't even run an election effectively? How much effort is there in looking my name or anyone else's up in the Direc tory in order to obtain the correct spelling? Worse yet was our ABS Presi dent's -- who spells his last name Soreas -- brushing off this inci dent as unimportant. Well, to me it was important, and no matter how Soreas tries to succeed in politics (if that is his future field of expertise), he will never a ch iev e anything worth repeating if he continues to employ such tactless actions. Ray Monastersk! '81 April 23,1981"
Players score many,
thanks from SAE,"To the Editor: On behalf of the brothers of Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity, I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to the entire campus for the support we received in our First Annual 24-hour Softball Marathon April 17-18. As a result of campus sponsors and com munity advertisers, the marathon suc ceeded in raising over $1500 for the Union County Heart Association and the Cor onary Care Unit at Evangelical Hospital. I also want to especially thank Gerald Commerford for all of his help and advice, President Dennis O'Brien for taking the time to attend the opening ceremony, and Bruce Corrie, Craig Reynolds and Sid Jamieson for allowing us to use the athletic fields April 17. Most of all, special thanks must go to all 26 teams for their tremendous cooperation and enthusiasm. I hope that everyone who participated in the marathon had as much fun as I know we did and will help us to make this an annual event.

By Todd G. Buchholz,"In every era, historians will tell us, there are myths and theories that hold societies together. And as these principles are disproved or debased, new civilizations are born. When Copernicus contended that the earth was not the center of the universe; when Darwin stated that Genesis was balder dash; when Apollo 11 proved the moon was not made of cheese-- these were overpowering events in history. After sober contemplation and incantation, I have decided that this week we have witnessed such a revolutionary turn. Before I divulge the answer I warn car diac patients to sit down. The Cherry Blossoms are out and are being trampled on the walkway before the parents have arrived. The theory that John Zeller controls the weather and Mother Nature has been smashed! We are free from his grasp, and from the rumors that steroids are used to program the blossoms. Some had even suggested the purpose of the new computer center is to program Spring in Lewisburg. Because the blossoms have escaped from Zeller's domain, the admissions department is worried. Polls show that the over whelming reason why students choose Bucknell over Harvard is that they prefer cherry blossoms to ivy. Without the cherries, we are as barren as Yale in New Haven. Complicating the case are the daffodils, which also decided to break the chains of serfdom and bloom early. Again, Admissions Director Richard Skelton and the math department have deter mined that the percentage of students who choose Bucknell is directly proportional to the percentage of daffodils that burst into bloom. Take a look at Freas Hall--the daffodils have wilted and died. Brenda Gordon is already offer ing the Freshman quad to the Lewisburg Farm er's Market. If the blossom myth has been destroyed, what else can go"

"He can write, but his grasp of",
English language is dubious,
By Allan W. Grundstrom,"Regrettably for Dean Chamber's kind introduc tion, and for all of us who were in Davis Gym nasium Tuesday evening, Andy Rooney's common sense did blink that night. In fact, its lids were tightly sealed for a third or more of his lecture. When Rooney spoke about writing and about the media he was humorous, serious and informative, but when he extended his comments to the nature of language--especially of English--his ideas were naive. He foolishly tried to demonstrate that English was the best language in the world--a dubious task. His criteria for awarding the prize to his own language w ere: English has the most words, it has the richest literature, it is the most concise, and it is the most democratic. Does having more words make a language bet ter? I doubt it, but it doesn't really matter because every language has the internal mechanisms to create new words forever. It is helpful to writers to know many words, but writers are not the same as languages. English is the medium of a very rich literature, but comparisons with other literatures can only be impressionistic and insulting to other peoples. Even if such comparisons were valid, they would sneak to the quality of writers, not languages. Rooney is consistent in his confusion. Concision, like vocabulary and literature, is a quality of good writing, not an evaluation of a language. "" English is democratic.""  That is concise, but not very clear. It seems to mean that it is spoken by the people. Not so in other countries? Rooney was at his most dangerous to society in his comments on bilingualism and Black English. There are few advantages to a multi-lingual socie ty, but it does seem democratic to allow children to start their education in a language they can understand. It may very well be the best way for them to learn the standard American Rooney wants for them. He was dead wrong in his characterization of Black English as illogical. It is a systematic, rule-governed, open-ended language capable of expressing all the subtleties of life. Every langauge has its own "" logic,""  unrelated to philosophical logic. I can only hope that Rooney will read a good book on linguistics before giving any more speeches on the topic. Allan W. Grundstrom is a professor of French and linguistics and is currently on sabbatical leave as Chairman of the Department of Modern Languages. parents cannot function in the cafeteria. Providing us with entertainment throughout the weekend, this tradition is reaf firmed as parents go spinning by, pushed from side to side, in and out of lines, and finally to their seats--without ever getting a tray or a sample of Bostwick's best. And it's a shame, because the food is always better on Parents' Weekend. Tomorrow, stand by the milk m ach in es and w atch as distinguished gentlemen and ladies become helpless children pushing the levers to the side, down and across, and in and out in order to get a drop. Eventually they turn to each other and mut ter, "" Oh, I 'd rather have a whisky sour anyway."" I wonder what will happen at the Synchronettes water show. Each year a father mistakes the fish formation for a mass drown ing, rips off his shirt, loosens his tie, and dives in to save his daughter. By this time, the girls"

They believe that the entire world goes to sleep at 9 when they return to their motels. So they tell their child, "" We'll meet you at 7 -.30 for breakfast."" "" Ugh,""  responds the college student, who planned to visit the bar and parties until 3 a.m. Sorry to shatter your myth, Mr. and Mrs. Middle America. But now you know why your child crawls into the cafeteria and calls you by his roommates' parents' name. Well, I warned you again, this is an exciting, dynamic epoch.

Bucknellian Dilemma forces,
the cartoonist to draw a blank,
By Bob Kallin,"Who reads the Bucknellian? Who needs the Bucknellian? In attempting to answer these questions, it became a monumental task to conjure up one redeeming factor about the campus chronicle other than that it provides cheap bedding for those myopic, wayward canines who defy state laws (can't they read the UC doors?) by settling for some shut-eye while their caretakers devour Bison- burgers. Other than providing the Bag Man with additional cargo or fueling the fantasies of budding arsonists, what positive purpose does the Bucknellian serve? Take heed! Past articles have caused turmoil among the troops, dissension in the ranks and food fights in Roy Grier ... Besides promoting the Ku Klux Klan, this numb tabloid has given the BPC an identity crisis and knowingly published sexist car toon strips (obviously an unresolved oedipal on the part of the cartoonist). To whom can we credit these disdainful jour nalistic atrocities? Who is responsible for making misery of the printed word? Obviously, the source of the problem lies with the totally insensitive, inept crew of misfits that label themselves editors, managers, writers, photographers and artists. But as the Registrar's office has argued, let us give credit (just one) where credit is due--to the Lou Grant of Roberts basement. The editor's managerial tactics have festered a staff infection, causing the editorial board to turn over faster than Gutenberg in his grave. When the major decision of the week shifts from front page headlines to whether or not to order pepperoni on the midnight pizza, someone is destined to become frustrated. But does the Bucknellian suffer from an inherent personality disorder or is this wanton weekly sim ply sacrificing quality for quantity? The New York Times has condensed its news policy into the seven words "" All the news that's fit to print.""  However, the Bucknellian seems to have adopted a modified version--"" All the news that fits, we print"" --which the production manager has affectionately changed to "" All this news gives the printer fits."" The simple truth of the matter is that, as the paper approaches press time, things get rather hec tic. The demand for copy swells, writers quit, sources are confirmed ("" Bless you, Deep Throat"" ), photographers quit, typing and layout begins, editors quit, managers quit and consultants quit. All in all, a busy night for the pink slip and the red pen. It is not surprising to see tempers flare as Flairs are tempered by editorial decree (will they print this piece?). How are we to salvage this sinking ship? I can of fer no solution for improvement; there is no hope on the horizon. My only suggestion is to enforce earlier deadlines. By avoiding the necessity of an all- weeker, the staff may adopt a more congenial at titude towards themselves and their work. I, for one, would holster quill in quiver if asked to draw a graphic for an opinions piece that arrived at midnight on Thursday. Touche. Bob Kallin, a graduate student in school psychology from Owego, N .Y., has to have his tongue rem oved from his cheek this w eek. Therefore, his article arrived too late for him to draw the accompanying graphic."

'Red Shadow ' econ. rock & roll band,
will give concert sponsored by BPC,"By DANNY CRAVEN The May Day Celebration sponsored by the Bucknell Progressive Caucus will culminate at 10 tonight with a musical performance by two doctorate-holding, radical economists from Washington D.C. The performers, Stephen Michelson and Ev Erlich are members of Red Shadow, the Economics Rock and Roll Band, composed of eight professional radical economists that plays in the Washington area and has produced two albums to date. Michelson and Erlich--who in their musical careers are known as Delta X and Beta Hat--are currently on tour as an offshoot of the larger group. Delta, who received his Ph.D. from Stanford University, is a senior partner in the prestigious Washington-based Econometrics Research Cor poration. Beta, who received his doctorate from the University of Michigan, holds the position of Senior Economist for the Congressional Budget Office. Their music, says Associate Professor of Economics Charles Sackrey, is ""political, satirical, and fun."" Beta and Delta sing about Marxism, economics and politics with a sound that is reminis cent of The Beach Boys, The Rolling Stones and Chuck Berry. Business Journal, in reviewing Red Shadow's first album Live at the Panacea Hilton said it was ""hilariously funny--even outrageous-- and, at the same time, well-equipped for a savage political attack on the capitalist system."" All of the songs to be performed tonight are originals written by either Delta, Beta, or members of Red Shadow. The titles and lyrics are obviously Marxist-oriented and poke fun at Capitalist dogma. Some of the more intriguing songs are: ""Stagfla tion,"" ""Commodity Fetishism,"" and ""Understand ing Marx."" The Cheep Amusement Band will follow the per formance by Red Shadow."
C&D selection group,
approves 'Minamata',"By ALLISON ABOUCHAR The play selection committee of Cap and Dagger, the Universi ty's theater organization, has ap proved the controversial but as yet unfinished work by a member of the theater faculty here for performance next January. At a meeting April 12, the 15- member play selection commit tee voted to recommend to the organization's entire member ship Sunday that the group stage ""Minamata"" in the third slot of four in next year's University Theatre mainstage schedule. The play is the project of Visiting Assistant Professor of English and Theater Jeffry Walker. The proposed ""Minamata"" would make a political statement opposing the dumping of mercury by the Chisso Chemical Corpora tion into Minamata Bay, Japan, and the decision to stage it in 1982 ""did not come without controver sy,"" Professor of English and Director of the University Theatre Harvey Powers said. ""Each Cap and Dagger produc tion reflects on the reputation of the organization. Some Cap and Dagger members felt that by put ting on 'Minamata,' the organiza tion would be endorsing a political statement they don't support,"" he said. Members were also hesitant because the script has not been completed, Powers added. Play Selection Committee Chairman Cynthia Lempert '82 concurred with Powers, but said ""People weren't too happy"" with Walker's presentation of his ideas at the April 12 committee meeting. ""There is always some discus sion over plays, but in this case people just got a little bit more antagonistic towards one another,"" while discussing the politicality of the work, she said. In addition to the play selection committee, several members of the Bucknell Progressive Caucus attended the meeting three weeks ago to support Walker's proposal, and several theater organization"
CYNTHIA LEMPERT,"members said the BPC's presence sparked much of the debate. ""There was also dissension on the basis of the problems that arose with Walker's first produc tion -- 'Early Stages',"" Lempert said. ""Early Stages"" was produced here in March 1980 and featured six students and Walker presen ting a collection of experimental and improvisational skits and solo performances, some of which were criticized for their overt political messages by both Cap and Dagger members and the audience. ""Though the play will be very political, I think the University is the place for that type of thing,"" Cap and Dagger President Dodie Rippon '82 said. She explained that most people voted for ""Minamata"" because of its experimental nature, which she said will help fulfill Cap and Dagger's goal of presenting a varied slate for next year. The names of the other three plays to be mounted next year have not been finalized. Walker--who is presently on tour as part of this semester's leave of absence -- was unavailable for comment."
'Postman' is laden with many intense sexual symbols,
Nicholson and Lange fiercely sensuous in performance,"By JESSICA WEICHSEL An impressive movie which contains vivid scenes, ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" should not be missed. Directed by Bob Rafelson and based on the novel by James Cain, the film portrays two lovers made slave to their animal lust for each other. The film presents Jack Nicholson as Frank Chambers, a vagrant with a crimimal past who travels through southern California during the 1930s. Chambers stops at a roadside gas station and restaurant and converses with the Greek owner, Nick Papadakis, played by John Col- icos. Chambers accepts a job from Papadakis after seeing the store owner's beautiful wife, Cora. Frank and Cora- portrayed by Jessica Lange--become lovers and, through an intricate plot, kill Papadakis. The rest of the movie details the consequences of the murder for the couple. The film carries an intense message, which becomes ob vious as each scene progresses. Director Rafelson and screenplay author David Mamet designed the scenes to be laden with sexual symbols, and the audience can easily see the relationship between Frank and Cora to be little more than uncontrollable animal lust. The most memorable scene takes place in the kitchen of the restaurant when the two have their first sexual en counter. Rafelson achieves his fiercely sensuous message by filling every frame with sexual images, taking in the loaves of unbaked bread around the kitchen and the meat knife Cora grasps in her frenzy. Nicholson's performance is reminiscent of his role in ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest."" His talent brings strength and expression to a difficult character: Chambers becomes both hero and villain through Nicholson's presentation, and the audience drifts between hating him and feeling sympathy for him. In each shot the power of Nicholoson's eyes causes the viewer to feel the frenzied passion or desperate pain Chambers feels; Nicholson vividly portrays his uncontrollable passion for Lange. Lange brings beauty and powerful expression to her role. The viewer can sympathize with this young woman isolated in the squalor of existence with her immigrant husband. The loneliness of life at the side of a California highway compels her to attempt escape. Colicos' portrayal of Papadakis is convincing, but it is difficult to believe that the Greek restaurant owner was not aware of the affair between his wife and employee. ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" opens tonight at the Campus Theatre.Showings are-at 7 and 9:10p-.m:"

frisbee practice this week. The Mudsharks are the second,

____________,
Ultimate Mudsharks take four,
of five in weekend tournament,"By KATE CROSS Bucknell's Mudsharks were a dominant force in the Frisbee regional playoffs for standings last weekend at Glassboro, N.J., winning four of their five games. The Mudsharks are seeded second for tomorrow's Eastern U.S. tournament in Purchase, N.Y. as only the world champion Glassboro Gang scored more total goals for the weekend. After a loss in their first game to the highly respected Jersey Jam, the Mudsharks rampaged through their next four games, winning all handily and racking up a total of 97 goals. The altered zone defense effectively limited scor ing by opposing teams in the cold, windy weather. Moving an extra man to midfield created a virtual wall against the opposition's efforts to score up wind. The Ultimate Airspace and George Mason bowed 14-6 and 208 to the Mudsharks' tight defense and ag gressive offense Saturday afternoon. The Mudsharks walloped Bucks County, 33-6, and the Philadelphia Frisbee Club, 25-8, Sunday. Team member Rich Schaberg '81 commented, "" We gained confidence as the weekend went on, and we knew we could win."" Bucknell and Glassboro, who have perenially turned out top-rate lidspinners, copped the top four positions with the Jersey Jam and the Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove. Sporting such seasoned diskers as John Sinnenberg '79, Bob Bruin '78 and Fid Speer '79, the Sages showed great strength Saturday, piling up 71 goals in three games. "" Individual performances by all players were outstanding which was necessary in our man to man defense,""  Britt Clayton '81 said. "" Intensity on defense was the key to our game."" This weekend's Eastern playoffs at Purchase, N.Y., will be the spring's big tournament, with teams from the New England and Mid Atlantic regions expected to participate. Invitations have also been extended to clubs from the South and Midwest."
Pair of water polo squads impress in BU tournament,"By JEFF CROSS "" What a disappointing way to lose a game""  said goaltender Tony Paxton '81 of Bucknell's senior squad after the conclu sion of last weekend's water polo tourna ment in Freas Rooke Pool. After pulling to within one goal of the New York Athletic Club 'B' team on senior Mark Gensheimer's score with 30 seconds remaining in Saturday's championship game, the Senior Uighurs went into a tun court press in a desparate try for the tying goal. However, a three quarter length of the pool shot eluded Paxton and all Bison defenders to give the NYAC 'B' the title with a narrow 6-4 victory in the unofficial tournament. Scott Schulte '81 scored two of his tournament-high 25 goals while classmate Marc Corl notched the first Bison goal The Uighurs reached the finals by outscoring Cornell, the Philadelphia Aquatic Club and the Bucknell Varsity by a combined score of 52-13 and edging the NYAC'A' 13-12. The Varsity--a group of players who were mostly substitutes on the squad that took seventh in the NCAA Championships last fall--edged Navy, 10-6, Fordham, 9-6 and the NYAC 'A', 10-9. In addition to los ing to the Senior Uighurs 16-2, the Bisons fell to eventual champion NYAC 'B', 12-6. Tom Butler '82, the assists leader on last fall's varsity, led the team with 12 goals in the tournament, including six against For dham. Junior Dan Dougherty and sophomores John Simone and Jeff Payne chipped in with six apiece. Freshman Scott Mutschler (with four goals), sophomore Dan Goss (two) and junior Dave Inglefield (one) also scored for the Bisons. Goaltenders Mile Hoffman '83 and Bill Porter '84 were credited with 24 and 11 saves in the five games, respectively. The tournament concludes the spring season for the water polo squad."

Tennis tunes for ECCs;,
"is trounced in final, 8-1","By DAVE KIRKPATRICK The men's tennis team traveled to Lafayette Tuesday, losing 8-1 in its final dual match before the East Coast Conference champion ships at West Chester this weekend. Coach Craig Reynolds' netters should have known it would be a long afternoon when, due to inclement weather, there was confu sion among team members over whether the match would be played. As a result, one player missed the trip, causing the regular line-up to be shuffled. An injury to fifth singles player Mike Driscoll '84 and a forfeit at third doubles further hindered the Bisons' chances. Last week, the team recorded two tight wins, winning 5-4 over conference rivals West Chester Monday and Delaware Friday. About the West Chester match, Reynolds said, ""We had to change the starting at the last moment, and this earlier time led to some sloppy play."" Reynolds' point was emphasized when the first three singles players for Bucknell lost. The strong play from the doubles tandems of juniors Bill Beneke and Scott Simpson and Driscoll and Paul Adkins '81 pulled the match out for the Bisons, however. Starring in the Delaware match was first singles player Steve Haas '83, who ""played his finest match of the year,"" according to Reynolds. Bucknell streaked through the singles matches 4-2, but needed clutch performances from Adkins and Driscoll in the doubles to win the contest. Looking ahead to this weekend's ECC championships, Reynolds said, ""Dual meets are really only played to determine seedings for the conference championships."" He picks Temple to win its sixth straight crown, and considers Bucknell, Lafayette, and Lehigh ""very capable"" underdogs."

Track excels in ECC tuneups,"By MIKE DeBRAGGIO The men's track team finished its preperation for this weekend's East Coast Conference Cham pionship meet with some fine per formances in two meets Friday and Saturday. Despite relatively poor racing conditions, Bison trackmen turned in some very impressive marks at the Penn Relays in Philadelphia last week. T h u rsd ay night, Bill Reifsnyder '84 and Jim O'Shea '81 ran IC4A-qualifying marks in the 10,000-meter (6.2 mile) run. Reifsnyder clocked in at 29:45 for sixth with O'Shea five seconds back in eighth. Sophomore Mark Hulme, running the 5,000-meters (3.1 miles), also met the IC4A qualifying mark in his event with a 13th-place time of 14:25. In action at Penn Friday, junior quartermilers Rocky Thompson, Steve Craig and Michael Jackson all recorded 50- second splits in their respective legs of the 1,600-meter relay. The fourth team member, Mike Geraghty '84, was tripped in his leg, eliminating the Bucknell en try that could have possibly finished third in its race. Several Bucknell entries in Saturday's contests fared quite well. Junior Rick Sayre recorded the Bison's highest finish of the week-long meet in his specialty, the 3,000-meter steeplechase. Sayre finished second to Ken yon Solomon Chebor of Fairleigh Dickinson. Chebor ran with the pack for five laps and then opened up a 20-30-meter lead on the group with a strong, quick move. Sayre also broke with the pack but was never able to make up the deficit. His time of 8:46.5 was more than eight seconds off Chebor's winning effort of 8:38.1. In the javelin, senior A1 Wegener continued his recent im provement with a personal best toss of 205 feet. Wegener has con sistently thrown over 200 feet all season. Bucknell athletes also com peted in a four-team meet at Clarion State Saturday after noon. Although snow and wind hampered most of the times on the track, there were noteworthy performances in the field events. Freshman Steve Mackay picked up a first place in the discus with a toss of 131 feet, while junior Mike Ward's 48-foot effort in the shot put was the day's best. Bill Miller '84 took another first for Bucknell with a leap of 6-4 in the high jump. Despite the conditions, there were some good efforts on the track where Paul Gutowski '82 won the high hurdles in 15 seconds and Mark Shaffer '81 took the intermediate hurdles in 57 seconds. Looking toward the ECC cham pionships at Lehigh this weekend, Coach Art Gulden cited ""competitive attitude"" as the key to winning the title. ""We can score in almost every event--the question is whether we do or not."" Gulden also noted that it will be important for his squad to score some big points. ""That's what hurts us in doors,"" Gulden said. ""We scored in a lot of places, but there weren't enough of the big scores we needed."" The Bisons are not the favorites in the conference meet. Although Delaware is the three-time defending champion, they are more vulnerable than ever, ac cording to Gulden. The Blue Hens' strengths lie in the weight and distance events. Temple, the ECC indoor cham pion, scores heavily in the events from the mile down and the jumps; however, the loss of their top sprinter figures to undermine their strength considerably. Bucknell brings in a more balanced attack than they have in the past few years. The Bisons are capable of scoring--and scor ing big--in almost every event."

Pennsylvania Grand Dragon Jim Locke, the state leader of the Invisible Empire, Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, said in an ex clusive interview with the Bucknellian Wednesday that a recruitment drive here scheduled for Saturday had been called off after he had received threats of violence. Locke said he had received "" threats that more than 200 pro testors from the Jewish Defense League and Black Brotherhood of America would violently oppose any Klan appearance in Lewisburg."" Locke said although only 20 Klansmen would have par ticipated in recruitment, "" more than 300 Klansmen would have come to Lewisburg for support-- with 80 percent legally registered to use firearms.

Sexual harassment of women here is ndegtJ!JSPS2Pmon,"By ANNE CLEMENS The sexual harassment of female students here by male students and faculty -- although not uncommon -- is a problem that frequently goes officially unreported, according to various administration of ficials. A list compiled by Campus Security of all reported incidents involving "" sexual harassment"" in this academic year numbers 18, the most common of which in volve a male "" prowler"" -type -- described variously as a "" Peeping Tom,"" a "" suspicious"" male in or near a woman's dormitory or an actual intruder into a woman's bedroom or hall bathroom. Eleven of these have been called to the at tention of Security since September, ac cording to the list. The record, which was made available to the Bucknellian this week by Vice Presi dent for Administration and Finance John Zeller, also includes four "" assaults"" rang ing from a man trailing a woman on foot to physical conflict between a romantically involved couple. "" National statistics on 'sexual harass ment' indicate that only one-tenth of such cases are reported,""  according to Assis tant Dean of Student Affairs Joe Mam- mola.

The first three classes who have seen their gift omne to fruition -  1968, 1969 and 1970 -  have all voted to give scholarship funds to Bucknell, he said. By N ANNETTE COOKE The University will install a new phone system this summer which will enable students living in University housing to dial directly from their room phones and accept collect calls 24 hours a day. . . Vice President for Administra tion and Finance John Zeller said although students will be able to dial directly--which was not possible with toe present closed- circuit system--toe new system will require callers to dial seven digits instead of four for on- campus numbers. The student in each room whose last name comes first alphabetically will receive toe monthly phone bill for toe room's phone from the University which is billed by the Buffalo Valley Telephone Company. The billing procedure is explained in Section B. of toe 1981-82 Residence Hall Room Application and Contract, which students who went through room picks this week had to sign. According to Zeller, there will be problems in collecting phone bills and an office will be set up on toe first floor of Marts Hall to handle toe monthly billings. ""The real advantage to toe new system is that it will permit students to take advantage of toe lower direct dialing rates, Zeller said. ""The only real disadvantage to the new system is that callers must dial seven digits instead of four for the emergency 1111 fflgm"

According to Zeller, toe revised phone system has been in toe planning stages since the spring of 1979, but has not been installed yet because of toe costs as well as the rewiring that will be done during toe summer, when most rooms are available for repairs.

More proposal passed despite opposition,

LISACERUTI,chance to come up with an alternate pro- $ g j
HARRY GARVIN,"By LISA CERUTI The University faculty passed toe third, fourth and fifth motions of toe proposal for a University-wide writing program Monday despite a motion to postpone further discus sion and voting on toe remaining motions until October. Although three parts of toe proposal were passed at toe regularly scheduled monthly faculty meeting, there is still opposition from some faculty members, including fessor of English Harry Garvin, who moved in an impassioned speech, to table voting on toe pending sections. But his motion was re jected by voice vote. . The three parts passed Monday describe provisions for remedial writing work, upper-division credit for unconventional 1 courses and toe duties of toe Writing Center. Garvin cited advantages for toe Depart ment of English, toe Committee on Instruc tion and toe faculty in postponing further voting until the fall. ""If we postpone voting, other members of the faculty would have a chance to come up with an alternate pro posal,"" Garvin said. Acting Head of toe Department of Engllsn Dennis Baumwoll, who strongly opposes toe proposal, said he ""doubts that people will devote time to creating an alternative writing program when one already exists. Garvin said ""toe Department of English has been by-passed"" by toe Committee on instruction while toe proposal was being composed. ""We saw drafts but those who were originally in favor now oppose it because we see it's not what we would have designed,"" he said. # _  :. _ Associate Professor of English Tucker Or- bison -  supporting toe Instruction Commit tee's efforts -  disagreed with Garvin, say ing ""I don't accept that the English depart ment has been by-passed. We've been con sulted at every turn."" . . ,, J nnUlll Much of Monday's debate centered on the ""ambiguity"" and toe ""need for clarifica tion"" of toe proposal. Garvin said during discussion of the fifth motion that ""perhaps over toe summer toe Committee on Instruc tion could transform toe current proposal to make it more concrete."" In addition, Associate Professor of English John Murphy asked for clarification of toe Writing Center's ""other duties as mentioned in part five of toe proposal, and Associate Professor of English Philip Withim replied that ""if the committee knew what toe other duties were, we'd put them in."" English Department Chairman John Tilton moved to amend toe fifth motion of toe proposal by deleting toe rol(r) ministration in assigning toe ""other duties of toe Writing Center. Tilton called for a little integrity"" and asked toe faculty not to leave it open to toe administration to prescribe what toe Writing Center will be. The motion to amend part five was passed. Voting on toe remaining seven motions of toe proposal will continue Monday at another specially scheduled meeting."

Klan supports policy of segregation,
for students in the Klan Youth Corps,"From KLAN, page 1. and today. Many are confronted with a collapse of our justice system and grasp at straws for support. Although some of our membership comes from this, many more join from a belief in our ideals,"" Locke said. While official membership is secret, Klanwatch, operated by the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Ala., estimates the Invisible Empire is the fastest growing and most mili tant KKK group in America. Im perial Wizard Bill Wilkinson, who broke from the older Knights of the Ku Klux Klan in 1975 to form the Invisible Empire, is describ- "" too much into weapons"" . Locke said ""Wilkinson is very, very militant. While he doesn't advocate violence, he wants to be prepared for the coming race war. That's why we love him."" "" While I dread the 'thought, particularly because of my children, there is just too much racial hatred in the world which will inevitably lead to war. We want to be prepared,"" Locke said. Locke gave an example of the determination of the Klan by describing Klan justice: "" Sup pose a man is convicted of seling dope to elementary school kids. Typically, he will be let off lightly and continue his trade. The Klan will not stand for this and will first warn him to stop his ac tivities. The next step is to tar and feather him, men finally make sure he will never hurt our children again. This is necessary due to the ineffectiveness of our judicial system."" When questioned about the ex istence of a guerilla training camp in Alabama, Locke con firmed this and said, "" the camp is not a training ground for offen sive tactics. Instead it is used to instruct members in security methods and weapons handling in case a confrontation arises dur ing Klan activities."" When asked if such a camp ex isted in Pennsylvania, Locke refused to comment. Locke said the greatest pro blem that faces our society is a disintegration of the basic moral values. "" In the early '60s,"" Locke said, "" Soviet leader Nikita Khruschev said he would over come this country without firing a shot, instead attacking through our society's base."" While Klanwatch reports that attempts to recruit children are one of the most poorly in vestigated aspects of the Klan, Locke confirmed that the Invisi ble Empire operates a Youth Corps in Pennsylvania. "" Membership is open to youths 10 to 18 years old. An LD. card is provided for the $6 yearly fee along with a set of business-like cards imprinted with the 'Get on the Klan-Man' motto. Members also receive a monthly copy of The Klansman, the Invisible Em pire's magazine,"" he said. Locke said it was true that a flyer distributed to children read in part that, "" an attempt is being made to undermine young peo ple's respect for the values of our nation and race. Black studies g l o r i f y  m y t h o l o g i c a l achievements of the black race. Christian values have been replaced by Jewish history. Little notice is given to the violence against students by the black savages who roam the corridors at will. Murder of white students by black students is on the in crease."" Locke also confirmed that youths are taught how to use and care for firearms by the Klan. "" We follow the National Rifle Association age requirement of 12 years old for the kids and b e l i e v e  t hey  shoul d be knowledgeable and responsible in the handling of weapons whether for hunting or protection."" The Youth Corps program is further directed towards organiz ing white youths along white lines, a "" get-tough"" policy with arrogant non-whites and segrega tion of classes followed by even tual segregation of schools. Locke agreed with the segrega tion requirement and said, "" every human being must have freedom of choice -- integration is forcing students into associa tions they don't want.""  Locke also supported Wilkinson's state ment that "" segregation has work ed for 300 years and therefore there must be something good about it."""

A new student handbook and course,
guide is written by student groups,"A new student handbook intended to "" fill stu dent's needs""  is being written by student commit tees directed by the ABS Congress. B e ring Bucknell will be published to supplement the University's present student handbook, which "" doesn't do enough to guide student life, according to one of the guide's four editors, David O'Connell '82. "" The main point of the guide is that it s being written for and by students,""  O'Connell said. The handbook will consist of four sections : a short history of the University including "" strange facts and interesting sidelights"" , descriptions of student organizations, a guide to "" cutting through Universi ty red tape"" and information about useful shops and services in the Lewisburg community. According to O'Connell, the project has received $3,500 from the ABS Congress and editors are hop ing to sell copies to cover the costs of printing which will probably be $3,900."
ABS,"President Michael Suarez 82 is formulating a plan of action""  to compile a course guide whose "" purpose is to inform students and also to en courage excellence in teaching among the faculty. Suarez said he, the rest of the Steering Committee and other congress members will be organizing ui the fall to gather information on the University s courses and professors. "" The problem with the existing guide is that it really doesn't say what students have found out about courses and professors. "" There is no hard data and students have to get everything through the grape vine,""  Suarez said. Suarez said his committee will have the new course guide written in the late fall of 1981 and it will include descriptions of courses traditionally offered for the fall of 1982"

Faculty discuss,
a new proposal,
for curriculum,"By LISA CERUTI Dean of Arts and Sciences Robert Chambers asked the faculty of the College of Arts and S cien ces W ednesday for "" guidance""  on how to proceed with a working paper drafted by the Special Committee on General Education which describes a program for cur ricular reform. The "" Proposal for General Education""  was presented to the Arts and Sciences faculty at a special meeting by members of the com m ittee. The draft describes the group's rationale for a general education cur riculum, the academic major, the perspective requirement and a General Education Council -- all of which are tentatively included in the plans for curriculum reform. The eight-member committee was appointed in January by Chambers at the request of the faculty to come up with a "" proposal for reform that would be both workable and stimulating for students and faculty alike,"""
ROBERT CHAM BERS,"according to Chambers. The informal discussion of the proposal at the meeting was led by Chambers and was concluded with a request for written remarks from the faculty about the draft. The ABS Congress passed a position paper at its regular meeting Monday which "" en dorses the spirit of the proposal,"" according to"
ABS,"President Michael Suarez '82. "" The current system of requirements needs to be critically examined and we will urge the committee to pursue the development of the pro posal,"" Suarez said."

"" I think it's good to have a woman on the security force because representation of women here has been ignored un til now."" In a series of interviews, the Bucknellian was told of approx imately one dozen incidents of sexual harassment involving female University students that have never been officially reported. One of these incidents -- which occurred in the fall of 1979 -- in volved a then - sophomore woman and her boyfriend on their way to a fraternity party on University Avenue. As they walk ed by a group of people convers ing outside one house, one freshman in the group made a comment, then reached out and inserted his hand under the woman's blouse to grab her breast, according to the woman.

In response to the letter from the officers requesting an end to their link with the UPGWA, the union filed similar intentions with the Na tional Labor Relations Board two weeks ago, and Vice President for Administration and Finance John Zeller told the Bucknellian this mor ning that he had received word from the NLRB today saying that the union's certification here had been removed. "" Now it's official,""  Zeller said. "" The security force is no longer represented by any union."" According to Roberts, Security was not pressured to sever ties with the UPGWA by the University. He said Zeller was "" careful"" in his statements, and he did not interfere with the relationship between the union and the officers. "" It took joining the union to get their attention,""  Roberts said, but "" now we're giving them a chance."" Roberts added he hoped the University would "" respond in good faith.""

Sands dies on 66th,
day of hunger strike,"Irish Republican Army hunger striker Bobby Sands died Monday in Belfast, Ireland, on the 66th day of his politically motivated hunger strike. Sands, who was serving a 14- year sentence in the Maze Prison for a firearms violation, demand ed from the British government that he and other Irish na tionalists jailed on terrorism charges be granted political status since they view them selves not as criminals but as soldiers in a war of in dependence. He refused to eat un til such demands were met. Although Irish Prime Minister Charles Haughey appealed for more flexible prison administra tion in Belfast, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in sisted that "" there can be no com promise with murder and ter rorism."""
East-west relations,

The communique, made public at the end of the NATO countries' two-day conference of foreign ministers in Rome, signaled at least a preliminary verbal step by the alliance in the direction toward the Reagan Administra tion's views on the Soviets. But it also followed the American announcement Mon day that the U.S. would be willing to discuss certain limitations on nuclear missiles in Europe with the Soviet Union before the end of the year. _______ _"

The votes, a prelude to the ex pected adoption sometime today of the $689 billion budget en dorsed by President Reagan, followed two days of debate in which the liberals pleaded for the restoration of programs they con sidered vital to the poor. Meanwhile, the Senate Finance Committee also took a knife to budget fat, approving legislation Tuesday that would cut $10.3 billion from a wide range of social program s including welfare, Medicaid and unemploy ment compensation."
Information Act to,

In an announcement that the Reagan Administration has begun a formal review of the Freedom of Information Act, Smith said the change rescinds the requirements--established by then-Attomey General Griffin Bell in 1977--that agencies wan ting to withhold requested in formation must prove such disclosure would be "" demon strably harmful""  to the govern ment. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press Director Jack Lawdow said the new revi sion "" will surely restrict the public's right to know govern ment information."""

Lewisburg resident,

Union County Coroner James Schwartz, Mifflinburg, pronounced her dead of a broken neck and multi ple internal injuries at the scene of the accident. State police at Milton said the car--driven by Mrs. Wise's son, Thomas, of 118 Market St., Mifflinburg--was travelling at an apparent high speed when it collided with an auto driven by Kathleen Radel, 27, of Penns Creek. The Wises were thrown about 50 feet from the vehicle after it left the roadway and went into a wheat field, striking an em bankment."

Additional work on the steel frame of the bridge--which spans the Susquehanna River from the eastern end of Market Street into West Chillisquaque Township-- began Monday, and will continue from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. weekdays for the next three or four weeks, according to a State Department of Transportation spokesman. Periodic delays to motorists are expected, he said, and Mon day was the first day the bridge was open to only one lane of traf fic at a time. The river bridge was closed for deck repairs from July 14 to Sept. 12 last year."

That's a clear-cut case of sexual harassment which shouldn t,
happen anymore because we're civilized -- we're even college,
students -- and we know that type of thing is intolerable.,
But it does. And it happens here. Campus Security reports docu,
ment at least 15 incidents of sexual harassment here this year.,
Surveys show that only one out of ten incidents is reported.,
The University took a positive step when it hired Donna Digin to,
complement a previously all-male security force. Digin's training,
in dealing with cases of sexual harassment provides some,
"reassurance, but we would like to see increased action on the part of",
"the counseling service, Student Relations in Sexuality, and the Of",

"The key word on the subject of sexual harassment is awareness,",

"promptly be taken, so we can all be protected.",

LETTERS,
This is straight from a Sig's mouth,"To the Editor: The Bucknellian has once again failed to follow up on something it started. Also, the newspaper likes to try and stir controversy instead of covering the events that take place here at Bucknell. Since the Bucknellian has not come to me or to Sigma Chi about Sig Derby, I will offer the en couraging information of a most successful event. First off, I feel everyone should know that no less than $1,000 will be sent to Sigma Chi's national service pro ject, Wallace Village, a facility that treats youths afflicted with minimal brain dysfunction. This year funds were raised through our Sig Derby Program, a raffle, the legs pictures and the drink-a-thon. We at Sigma Chi would like to thank our alumni for their donations, and also the faculty member who made a donation. In reflecting back on Derby Days '81,1 feel proud to say that all ran fairly smoothly in the end, and that most everyone enjoyed the festivities. The results of Sig Derby saw Coach Joe Claffey lead Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority to victory while Coach Tim Christie's inspiration ena bled Alpha Chi Omega sorority to earn the Spirit Award. It was a tough competition right down to the wire, and for that I'd like to thank all the coaches and the sororities for a job well done. Special thanks also goes to all those who helped me to make Sig Derby a success and a most memorable time for me. To the Bucknellian, thanks for allowing me to report on Derby Days '81, and I hope next year the school newspaper spends a little more time reporting on the events of this campus. Donn Zacune '81 Sig Derby Chairman May 5,1981"
Nice guys aren't so bad,"To the Editor: Item: The marching bands of Yale and Harvard have half-time shows depicting muggings and sexual innuendo, while the marchers wear diapers. Item: Students in schools like the University of Michigan and University of Pennsylvania engage in a game called KAOS: Killer As Organized Sport, where they run around campus staging mock assassinations; the person with the most victims wins. Is this the modem college experience? Somehow I don't feel so bad about going to a school where the main fault of the student body is that it's nice. Jim Snedeker '81 May 6,1981"
A 'private'public issue,
that should be discussed,"To the Editor: It is still possible radioactive tritium and carbon-14 may be in- cincerated at Bucknell's power plant. Jack Harclerode's letter to the administration suggests, "" The only possibility that comes to mind is that perhaps incineration could be done at Bucknell's power plant. I would like to request that this avenue be explored by the Physical Plant and that in the future we dispose of radioactive wastes in this fashion if at all possible.' ' I feel this is a public issue, and, I asked Harclerode, John Zeller, Wendell Smith, and six others to "" have an open panel discussion to inform this community about radioactive wastes that will be created and disposed of here, and how they might affect our en vironment and health.'' Two weeks later, I had gotten no response. After asking again, I finally got an uninformative note from Wendell Smith saying "" an ad hoc committee of science and engineering faculty will be asked to review NRC's data."" Why are there only science and engineering faculty on this com mittee? Ask other community members whose lives are affected. For example, Dave Mann of the Susquehanna Valley Alliance in Lewisburg has studied nuclear power and radioactive wastes and has said, "" I'll be glad to help if I can."" Our questions concerning the use of radioactive waste and its ef fect on our health and environment are still unanswered. Our ad ministration should inform us about radioactive wastes on campus. Why is the decision on this campus issue left in the hands of a few? Charles Eaton'83 May 5,1981"
"The groups are the same, but meaning is missing",
By Tom Madigan,"While strolling down a dark, lonely street late one night, I heard a voice call to me from one of the garbage-filled alleyways, "" Hey, got a minute?""  I curiously replied, "" Sure,""  and out of the darkness of the alley stepped a rather disheveled man in his early thirties. "" Who are you?""  I asked. "" I used to be a folk singer, but nobody wants to listen to that kind of music anymore,""  was his re ply. A folk singer, I thought to myself. Another one of those lost flower children of the '60s. You never know, though, this might be "" Candid Camera""  or something. I confidentially asked him to explain, all the time making sure to keep my best side facing the camera that might have been hidden in the trash can. "" It's rather complicated,""  he replied. "" I was big at one time. We had the kids ques tioning everything--the war, poverty, the government, the whole works. But that was a long time ago, when the people buy ing the albums really cared about what the music was trying to say. Jefferson Airplane, Tom Rush, Donovan, The Byrds--there was always a message in their music, not like this garbage they're selling today."" "" Wait a minute,""  I interrupted. "" You can't talk about my music like that. If this music you're talking about is so hot, how come I never hear it on the radio? "" He let out a sigh and rolled his eyes. "" You're just like all the rest--you don't understand at all. Back then music had a purpose other than pure and simple enter tainment. Musicians wrote about political and social issues. Songs had a message..."" "" OK,""  I shouted, "" but what about musi cians like Bob Dylan and the Rolling Stones? They were big then and they're still popular now. And what about Jeffer son Airplane? They changed their name but they're still recording. What about that, you hippie freak! "" "" Their music has changed,""  he replied. "" Dylan sings about God now. Jefferson Airplane used to write songs about a revolution, now they write songs about miracles."" "" So the music's changed. But that's nor mal. The stuff you're talking about was a big change from the music of the '50s,""  I stammered. "" Exactly. The music is a reflection of the public's values and concerns. Today's music is a regression to the 'Richie Cun ningham' stuff of the '50s. It's an anesthetic, just like television. It all diverts the public's attention away from what's really going on in the world. "" Sure, the dosage used today is stronger than that of the fifties--sex and violence instead of high school romances and cars--but it has to be; there's a lot more to divert attention away from today. People don't want to know what's going on, so they absorb themselves in things totally re moved from the 'real world,' like new wave music. You know, leave the prob lems for somebody else to handle."" "" But what about punk rock?""  I replied meagerly. All those musicians sound real angry and dress so weird and everything."" "" Well I've got to admit, I thought punk was the real thing for awhile there. But, the bands that really had something to say were all from Europe, and they never real ly picked up a following here."" "" That's true, and disco is so regimented and style oriented...I mean..."" But it was too late. The musician--sensing a possible recruit, exclaimed "" Right! Right! You're starting to understand. No time to worry about real life problems--You've got to get the choreography straight... "" This was too much. What would my friends think? What if that really is a camera over there? "" Look pal, I agree with some of the things you're saying, but....um, like, I've kind of got to get going, you know? Can I lend you some money ? "" A dejected expression replaced his smile. "" That's OK,""  he said, and slunk back into the darkness of the alley. Tom Madigan '82 is a double major in eco nomics and political science. He lives in Dun kirk, N Y ."

Phil's final offering: words of wisdom and warning,
By Phil Andrews,"Albert Einstein, the man who did as much as anyone to help us understand the world in which we live, once said, "" The most incomprehensible thing about the world is that it is comprehensible.""  This is not to say that any one person can sum up the human condition at this particular time in history. And it would be wise to cast a wary eye on those who claim they can. __________________________"
PHILLING,
IN,"Nevertheless, I think it is important col lege students attempt to fathom our human condition, both because one thereby achieves a better understanding of oneself and because leaders of American society should have reflected on such things before attaining leadership posi tions. That said, I offer the following observa tions for your consideration. Critical thinking is on the wane. Half the world's population lives under totalitarian rule, with no decrease in sight. Alfred North Whitehead noted, "" Civilization ad vances by extending the number of impor tant operations which we can perform without thinking."" Is it not true most Americans will do almost anything to avoid being alone with their thoughts? If an American is alone in a car, it is a safe bet a radio or tape player will be on. By itself, this is not significant. But it seems to be reflective of a larger and worrisome trend. I've also wondered whether the U.S. could survive as we know it without televi sion. Assuming the average American watches two to three hours a day, it takes but two days for the nation to spend a billion hours in front of the set. Imagine what we could be doing instead. We live in an increasingly intercon nected world. Robert Penn Warren describes this beautifully in AU the King's Men when he says "" the world is like an enormous spider web and if you touch it, however lightly, at any point, the vibration ripples to the remotest perimeter."" In very practical terms, a corporate boardroom decision in the U.S. may have severe economic repercussions for the citizens of another country. It is crucial that those in powerful positions realize as Jack Burden eventually did in All the King's Men that there is no escaping responsibility for their actions. To improve the chance that people grasp the direct and indirect effects of their ac tions, colleges should emphasize an inter disciplinary and holistic approach to education. It is folly to separate knowledge to the extent we do. Consider the problem of scientific literacy among nonscientists and the implications that has for public policy. Nationalism is on the rise. We live at or near the peak of the sovereign state era. It is the state that commands the first loyalty of most people in the world today. Kenneth Boulding has said, "" the only religion that still requires human sacrifice is na tionalism."" Paradoxically, the state is increasingly unable to control its domain. Multinational corporations, exported inflation, acid rain and refugee flows are just a few of the many interstate agents of Change that are slowly eroding the sovereignty of the state. How long the sovereign state will last is unclear. What is clear is the imperative of some form of world federalism to provide for a nongeographical criterion for the distribution of world resources. Nationalism, when placed above love for humanity, is idolatry. To whom or to what is your first loyalty? The need for "" I-Thou,""  rather than "" I- It""  relationships is pressing. The terms are those of Martin Buber, a Jewish philosopher. His message was that it is wrong to treat a human as an object in stead of as a person--a unique individual. When people are relegated to the status of things, they become less than human to the people categorizing them. It then becomes "" acceptable""  to treat them as outlaws--as persons outside the protection of the law. Attitudes toward the enemy in wartime provide the best example of the conse quences of treating persons as things. The tendency of men on bombing missions to disassociate their actions with the carnage on the ground below is an illustration on an "" I-It""  relationship. Ominously, "" I-It""  appears even more likely with nuclear weapons, because of the tremendous separation between the point of fire and the point of impact. I have taken a stab at making sense of the world. It is of course skeletal and !in complete, but I hope it provokes thought and interest in the subject. I leave you with a quotation from Micah 6:8 that I find valuable as a guide for liv ing. The words may be found as well on the back, of Rooke Chapel: "" What doth the Lord require of thee but to do justice, to love mercy and to walk humbly with thy God."" voeoooccoeosoooco:"

Bourgeois liberal gains perspective,
& loses some liberal preconceptions,. - r _____ m irM io  fin o p rs heea:
By Dan Huck,"WASHINGTON--It was dubbed the "" Progressive Express"" to the March on the Pentagon here, Sun day, but when my alarm blared and I awoke at 5:57 a.m. Sunday, I felt anything but progressive. During my varying-heat shower (well-known among Kress residents), I began to have second thoughts about sharing my day with those "" bandana-bearing leftists"" of the Bucknell Pro gressive Caucus. The march was foremost, however, and so I sucked in my preconceptions and headed for the University Center. My back and legs immediately started aching when I saw a school bus instead of the Greyhound Ameri-Cruiser I had been sure would be waiting. But I stepped aboard, grabbed a front seat and waited. The others came in a quiet hum -- half pro fessors, half students -  with banners, signs and backpacks. As the bus filled, someone asked, "" Does so-and-so have the machete?"" ; no one laughed, refused to be paranoid and tried not to think about the paper due the next day. The Pennsylvania countryside soon began rolling by and I scrunched up with a Congressional Report on CIA activities in Chile. I though it was more ap propriate than Geology. My end of the bus was quite awake, and we talked and laughed about everything from politics to the Celtics-Sixers' basketball game. Everyone was willing to share the conversation, but my prejudices crept back and let me hide. The food was also shared liberally; oranges, breadsticks, celery, candy and other tupperware-contained goodies circulated freely. But I waited until Get tysburg, where I wolfed down a bourgeoise Big Mac and fries. . All of a sudden the bus was in Georgetown, then downtown Washington, then the Lincoln Memorial. After nulling up to the curb, the first salutation was from a policeman who told the driver, "" If you're not out of here in five minutes, it'll cost you 50 bucks. Not wanting to anger anyone in blue that day, I quickly beat some circulation back into my legs and got out. , . . , .. . That wasn't the only one of Washington s finest "" attending,""  though. They were there on foot, they were there in riot gear, they were on top of the Lin coln Memorial, they were on motorcycles, on mopedes and on horses. And they were in a helicopter that periodically buzzed the crowd, until"
INTRODUCING,"a chorus of up-raised middle fingers began to discourage them. __ ,, ,, A softball field near the State Department was the "" pre-rally""  point. Button and bumper-stickers salesmen had a field day while speakers launched emotional verbiage on everything from ElSalvador to the Palestine Liberation Organization. Those who could sit through the socialist bombardment might even have heard some salient points made. The marchers were then asked to assemble, and a band of 14-year-olds played anti-government disco to set the pace. A group psychologist must have planned the beginning stages of the march, because thousands of the people were moving the length ot a football field in the space of 100 feet. Eventually we "" hit the street"" and made a one-block loop past the State Department. I didn't realize until later that the chants and banners were directed at an empty building. (Sunday, you know.) As the procession crossed the Arlington Memorial Bridge, I began to notice not just socialists, com munists and "" progressive "" marchers, but also mothers, teachers and businessmen. The crowd was not just radical white kids from college, but also contained the liberals and moderates who had sat at home years ago and watched Vietnam on the six- o'clock news. , , . The chants ("" No draft, no war, United States out of El Salvador"" ) didn't last long in this procession. One hundred thousand people were there to make a statement just by their presence. Others--like Jef fry Walker and his professional and interesting "" Theatre Preserve"" --made more obvious statements at the Pentagon. Speeches at the "" post-rally"" continued on m emo tional repetition, and the time came to head back to Bucknell. We all shared some laughs and some beers, and this time, I even ate my middle-class meal with some of the BPC members, when we stopped in Gettysburg. The trip Sunday helped me make a personal state ment on El Salvador that no other method could have satisfied. Certainly it was not enough, but perhaps we members of the 100,000 have m some way sparked yours and this country's conscience. And to the BPC marchers I'd like to say thanks. You've given this bourgeoise liberal a better perspective and a few less preconceptions. _________ s / Don Huck, a freshman from Marietta, Ohio, plans to major in international relations and Spanish."

David Crosby's concert here is lacking,
Buskin and Batteau well-received by audience,"By JEFF CROSS To the dismay of many in the audience at Tuesday's David Crosby concert, the Bucknell Concert Committee's second presentation of a solo performer in the intimate confines of Coleman Theatre this semester proved less of an artistic success than its predecessor. While the Feb. 28 David Bromberg concert was generally acclaimed, Crosby gave an uninspired performance in a pair of shows. Whether it was caused by the mellow midweek atmosphere in the audience or the crowd's long ing for a return to the customary stand-up-and-shout concerts in Davis Gymnasium, Crosby's desultory effort left the audience wondering why they had paid $6 apiece to see a member of one of rock and roll's legendary groups. While some in attendance ap pealed for a solo rendition of Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young's stinging protest tune, "" Ohio,"" they had to settle for an evening of quiet acoustic guitar work. By contract, the talented warmup of David Buskin and Robin Batteau gave a thoroughly enjoyable performance that over shadowed all but Crosby's closing numbers, when his melodious guitar work was nicely com plemented hv the appearance of Carl Schwindeman on electric guitar. Crosby's soulful vocals and spirited playing on his final two pieces, "" Drive My Car""  and "" Wooden Ships,"" and the encore "" Long Time Gone"" were easily the highlights of the evening, drawing boisterous applause. Although the crowd sat silent throughout most of the early go ing of the 70-minute appearance, including two nondescript unreleased songs, "" Distances"" and "" Delta,""  the old favorite "" Guinnevere""  was more popular ly received. Buskin and Batteau gave a more lively show by delivering fast, lighthearted songs that kept the audience amused. After a hilarious dialogue con trasting life in Buskin's native New York City and Batteau's hometown of Cambridge, Mass., the pair sang their first mellow song, "" Cambridge Blues."" Buskin and Batteau's finest work was their final effort, "" The Boy With The Violin"" that, showcased Batteau's talents on the violin and mandolin with Buskin's accompaniment on the piano. Too bad the headline per former, with the exception of his final three songs, could not main tain the same level of intensity. Photos --Charlie uerul"

The quartet's members -- Christopher Rowland, Jonathan Sparey, Alan George and loan Davies -- studied together at C am bridge U niversity in England, where they formed the group in 1974, and their visit to the United States in 1978 initiated a series of appearances at various locations throughout the country. Among their recent ap pearances was a performance at Carnegie Recital Hall in New York in October. The quartet has exposed American music lovers to the music of Shostakovich in a flavor and style which is uniquely its own, and has been acclaimed by music critics as the foremost in terpreter of that composer.

"'Stir Crazy,",
',
"an entertaining comedy,",
portrays a 'great escape ' prison saga,"By DANNY CRAVEN "" Stir Crazy"" , a somewhat entertaining comedy from Columbia Pictures directed by Sidney Poitier, portrays two framed convicts in a spoof of the ar ch etyp a l "" G reat E sca p e "" prison saga. The film presents Gene Wilder as Skip Donahue, an unpublished New York playwright who possesses the reassuring, humanitarian romanticism that Wilder so aptly demonstrated in his previous role as Willie Wonka in the "" Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.' (1971) Also starring is pre- free-base Richard Pryor as Harry Monroe, an unemployed actor who--unlike his friend Donahue--has adopted a. realistic and somewhat caustic attitude towards life. Frustrated, Monroe and Donahue meet in a Manhattan bar and decide to head west to Hollywood for fame and glory. Short of cash, they stop in a redneck south-western town to earn money by dressing as woodpeckers and dancing in a pro motional skit for a local bank. During a lunch break, their ridiculous costumes become the disguises of bank robbers and the innocent Donahue and Monroe are sentenced to 125 years in prison. It is here that they plan an escape. Under Poitier's deft direction of a screenplay by Bruce Jay Friedman, it's the teamwork that counts. There is, for example, the glorious moment when Pryor tries to teach his pal how to behave in a stir-- by "" walking bad,""  ""talking bad,""  and "" looking baaaaaaaaad as they come."" Academy Award winning actor-tumed-director Poitier is a "" stickler for detail,""  according to Wilder. As such, most of the movie was filmed on location at the Arizona State Penitentiary using the inmates as extras. The concept of realism in com edy is a hard technique to execute, but Poitier does it with ease. "" When you lift a rock under Sidney's direction, you lift a real rock -- not a balsa wood phony. When you dig a ditch, the earth better move for you baby. In one scene, I'm confined to a torture chamber called 'the box', a sealed metal compartment 3 feet by 5 feet, as punishment,""  Wilder explains. "" It was 95 degrees outside and hot enough in the 'box' to cook a steak. I came out dripping perspira tion with my legs wobbling. Sidney was delighted. 'You're really acting,' he said. 'Who's acting?' I asked."" The contrast between realism and romanticism that Pryor and Wilder provide is entertaining. They have established a unique rapport with each other that is also evident in an earlier film "" Silver Streak""  in which they co-starred. "" Stir Crazy""  is not great, although it has grossed more than $100 million at the box office. However, it is a funny film, good for a lot of chuckles, a few hearty belly-laughs and an hour and a half of enter tainment. Shows begin tonight a 7 and 9 p.m. at the Campus Theatre. The film, rated "" R "" , also stars Georg Stanford Brown, Jobeth Williams and Lee Purcell."

C&D committee selects four productions for '81-'82,"Cap and Dagger members gave final ap proval Sunday to the controversial play "" Minamata"" and three other works as the four shows that will be staged by the group on the Coleman Theatre mainstage next year. Minamata--a work to be written and directed by Visiting Assistant Professor of English and Theatre Jeffry Walker--will premiere in mid-February. The play is ex pected to make a social and political states ment about corporate misuse of the environment, and its selection was exten sively debated by the Cap and Dagger Play Selection Committee before the choice was made. John Osborne's "" Look Back in Anger,"" a modern British human drama dealing with personalities, will be directed by John Braile '83 and staged on Parents' Weekend, Oct. 2-3. Auditions for the pro duction will be held on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday evenings at 7:30 pm. Next on the roster will be Shakespeare's comedy of mistaken identity "" Much Ado About Nothing,""  which will be directed by Professor of English and Director of the University Theatre Harvey Powers and presented in early December. The Kander and Ebb project, a musical review involving a collection of unpub lished songs will be directed by Jim Den ton of Watsontown, who is currently writing the production. The performances of the as-yet officially untitled work will be held on Spring Parents' weekend in May 1982. Cap and Dagger members also elected officers for 1981-82 Sunday. Will Walters '82 will serve as group's president, David Blackman '82 was elected vice president, Donna Hansen '83 will function as Play Selection Committee Chairman and Nancy Sanford '84 will serve as secretary.

An unidentified Bison batswoman eludes an attempted tag by the,
catcher during Bucknell's 11-5 trouncing of the Engineers on the West Field,
Saturday. The team finished the season at 7-11 despite a late surge.,
By S.J. FURMAN,
Just as the BuckneU Women's SoftbaU,
Team was beginning to play well together,
-  exemplified by a 2-1 victory over Sus,
quehanna Tuesday -  the season abruptly,
"ended, leaving the Bisons with a record of",
7-11.,
Action began in the fourth when the,
Crusaders scored their only run. The,
Bisons responded quickly and made it 1-1,
as junior Stephanie Buck led off the bottom,
"of the inning with a single, senior Patty In-",
"chalik singled, and a Crusader error enabl",
ed the runners to advance to second and,
"third. Alison Brown '82 walked, loading the",bdS6S.
"Two outs later, with the Susquehanna in",
"field back, Kay Swartz '82 successfully",

"again the fifth with a walk, a single and",
two sacrifices to make the final score 2-1.,
The Bisons played host to Lehigh Satur,

Golfers take eighth in Districts,
Bisons trail Temple by 77 with 54-hole score o f 970,"By JACK SNYDER "" We are through!"" a relieved Coach Jeff Ranck said after the golf team wrapped up its season Mon day and Tuesday with an eighth place finish in the NCAA District II Golf Tournament. Ten schools competed in the two-day tournament to qualify for the Nationals at the renowned Hog's Neck Country Club in Easton,Md., and the course proved to be a tough challenge for the Bisons as they struggled over the 7,100 yard shot-demanding track. Champion Temple showed no sign of fatigue as it ran away with the 54-hole tournament with a com bined team score of 893. The"
runnerup,"team, Penn State, was an astounding 50 strokes behind them, as Lehigh followed with a 947. Bucknell finished nestled in a tight crowd of seven schools, all within nine strokes of each other, to finish eighth at 970, edging Rutgers and Colgate which shot 971 and 972, respectively. Bill Francis '83 was low medalist for the Bisons, turning in a 54-hole round of 239, followed by Senior Captain Rob Wagner '81 and Peter Orr '84 both at 244. Mike Stoyla '82 and Kevin High '81 finished at 246 and 255. Although the team did not qualify for the Na tionals, Ranck said that Wagner stands an "" outside chance""  of qualifying individually for the Nationals based on his "" good consistent play through the year, with the exception of the districts."" Wagner must first be notified by an NCAA com mittee, which will determine his eligibility for the national tourney to be held at Stanford May 27-30. In the East Coast Conference Championship, held April 27-28 at the Brentwood Golf Club in Elkton Md., the team finished a disappointing sixth, with a 36-hole stroke total of 777. Wagner placed sixth individually with a 148 and Orr took 16th with a 152. Other leading Bucknell scorers were Stoyla with 158 and High at 160. The golfers had a relatively poor season this year due to a "" lack of interest and dedication""  on the team's part, which resulted in inconsistent play, ac cording to Ranck. The team had such shallow depth that at some matches Coach Ranck recalled "" the biggest question we were faced with was who wanted to play."" Despite the coach's dissatisfaction, however, the golfers finished with a winning 5-4 record."

Baseball drops a home,
twinbill to Bloomsburg,"By ROBERT BURNEY Back in the optimistic early days of the season, Coach Tommy Thompson confided that one of the biggest obstacles facing his baseball team was putting all aspects of its game together at one Never did that necessity become more apparent than during Monday's twinbill with Bloomsburg, in which the Bisons put on a show Lou Brock would have enjoyed--stealing 19 bases in 20 I attempts--but stiU managing to drop both games. "" Our pitching really hurt us,"" lamented Thompson. Freshman Mark Glatz pitched three strong innings in the opener before being touched up for five runs in the fourth, the big blow be ing a three-run homer by Jack LaCesa."
I,"a pair of errors by Carl Nablo '82 in the sixth paved the way for four more unearned runs off Jim Smith '84 effectively sealing the game for the Huskies. The Bisons' turns at bat were far from mundane, however, as they stole bases off Bloomsburg catcher Jeff Koscelarsky. Ed Hughes '83 led the assault with four swipes, while George Kangos 1 '81 and Paul Bamford '83 had two each; and Jim Eick '82, John Cor ned '84, and Bill Lawrence '81 and Jim Frantz '83 grabbed one apiece. Not to discriminate, the Bisons went to work on new catcher An dy Marcantonio in the nightcap and stole eight more sacks. Kangos, Bamford and Eick each grabbed a pair, while Lawrence and Comeil made off with another each. With four stolen bases on the day, Kangos set a new Bucknell | career record for steals, as his 27 eclipsed the mark of 26 set by Dave Kasputis '77. Unfortunately, pitching again served as the Bisons own worst enemy. Starter Tom Ganter '81 had to be yanked after giving up four runs in one-third of an inning. Rich Bongiovanni '82 gave up three in the second and two more in the third, before giving way to Smith who surrendered only one run over two innings. Ken Durr '82 pitched the final two frames, allow ing a pair of unearned runs. Bucknell pushed across two runs in the first, three in the third, i three in the fifth and one in the sixth off Ron Lockwood and Paul | Gibson. But nine runs weren't enough, as the Huskies made it a sweep, 12-9, and the Bison record fell to 6-8. Lafayette Coach Norm Gigon .got two complete-game victories from his starters when the Leopards paid their spring visit to i Lewisburg Saturday. Scott Bail6y scattered 11 hits and four runs in the opener for an 8-4 victory, while Hughes took the loss for Bucknell. Lafayette's Ed Vore came within five outs of a no-hitter m the nightcap, as Kangos' single in the eighth was all the offense the Bisons could muster. Durr pitched well for the batsmen, going the distance in the 4-0 loss. "" Durr has had some awfully tough luck this year,""  remarked Thompson, "" for the season he had there's no way he should be 2-6."" _____________ ________"

Women ruggers hobbled,
by 1st season's injuries,"By DAVID HAWKINGS Despite a one-day wave of in juries and a steady loss of in terest as the spring season has worn on, the women's rugby team has concluded its maiden voyage. It really wasn't much of a first- year season for the lady ruggers, though. They opposed another college only once, and were smashed and shutout 12-0 by an experienced Franklin & Marshall squad April 22. It was during that contest that the novice rugby squad took its worst beating, both in terms of the score and the rash of twisted ankles, separated collar bones and battered limbs that plagued the team all afternoon. Five Bison women were treated for such injuries during and after the contest. When asked about the torrent of injuries, sophomore Captain Patti Cullen cited the team's in experience in "" real"" match play. ""We just didn't know how to fall properly or take getting tackles,"" Cullen said. The afternoon in Lancaster was not a total loss for the team, however. The Bisons second- string squad -- with a little help from a few F & M ruggers who were recruited to round-out the "" B"" team -- scored a 6-4 victory over the F & M reserves. Both scores came from Bucknell players, however, as Claire Myers '82 scored a two-point tie and Cullen added a four-point field goal. .The only other formalized com petition this season was a 4-4 in- trasquad match played last week. A previously cancelled match with Dickinson was rescheduled for today, but was called off by the Red Devils again Thursday. The season began auspiciously enough for the team. The concept of a women's rugby squad first appeared on campus in mid- February, when senior Rugby Club member Jeff McConnell and Louise Bristol '83 called an open organizational meeting for a possible team which 70 people at tended. Encouraged1, McConnell and Bristol began a regimen of out door, often snowy practices three times a week -- within a few weeks, the number of women still interested in the new team had dropped to 50. Now the squad numbers about 30, although there are only about 22 that are willing to enter into match play, according to Cullen. Team m em bers remain hopeful for a fall season, however. Matches with Dickin son, Shippensburg, Gettysburg, Rutgers, St. Bonaventure and Penn State are now being arrang ed, and the women ruggers plan to apply for official club status -- and ABS funds -- in September."

Junior Bill Beneke advanced to the finals of the second singles bracket before losing to third seeded Rick Stassa of Lafayette, 6-4, 6-2. The unseeded Beneke upset the second and fourth seeds in straight sets en route to the finals. Beneke teamed with classmate Eric Simpson to finish in the runner up position at second doubles for the second consecutive year. The third seeded Bison due swept two opponents before bowing to Delaware's Ken Dill and Mark Kurla, 6-3, 7-6 with the final game being decided in a 5-4 tie breaker. Also reaching the finals was the first doubles team of sophomores Steve Haas and Mark Greenawald. The Bucknell pair bowed to Delaware's second seeded Steve Quemer and Ran dy Cerce in another tie breaker 7-5, 1-6, 7-6, after leading 5-2 in the final set.

In first singles, Haas and Simpson reached the semifinals -- at first and fourth singles, respective ly -- only to lose to the eventual winners of their brackets.

Trackmen score an upset victory at ECCs,Photo--Dove Folsom Martin Carter '82 set a Bucknell record in the 200-meter run during the Bison's upset victory at the East Coast Conference meet in Bethlehem last weekend.
Team title is first for Bisons since 1977 as,
balance gives a 40 point margin over St. Joe's,"By MIKE DeBRAGGIO BETHLEHEM--The Bison trackmen are cham pions, again. Despite being underdogs in the East Coast Con ference Championship meet Saturday and Sunday here at Lehigh, the men's track and field team swiped the team title going away, tallying 141 points to St. Joseph's 101.5 and Temple's 74. Three-time conference winner Delaware had 69.5 while Lafayette grabbed the fifth spot with 53 points. It was the first time since 1977 that Bucknell won the meet. The trackmen displayed a unique team balance, completely overwhelming their nine opponents. The field event athletes contributed 50 of Bucknell's 141- point total; the distance runners, 47, and the sprinters, 44. "" We had people placing everywhere,"" junior miler Steve Bigotto said. In fact, orange and blue-clad athletes qualified in all but two of the twenty events contested. The Herd fared well Saturday evening, the first day of competition. In the three final events that night, Bucknell tallied eight points behind the third place effort of senior A1 Wegener in the javelin and the fifth place performance of Gary Bartlett in the hammer throw. Bartlett, who was BuckneU's outstanding field athlete for the two-day meet, threw the hammer 44.78 meters for a new school record. Bucknell also qualified eight runners for the Sunday finals in trial races held Saturday night. The momentum continued Sunday afternoon. In fact, the momentum never shifted, as the trackmen controlled the first gun. Nearly every runner, jumper and thrower who wore an orange jersey did what they were capable of doing. Led by Bartlett, Bucknell's field events picked up where they left off the night before. Bartlett added a third place in the shot put with a toss of 15.12 meters, while his 44.24 meter effort in the discus earned him an individual conference crown. Junior Mike Ward and sophomores Jamie Dodd and Ted Lewis all placed second in their respective events. Ward threw 15.31 meters in the shot, Dodd went 14 feet 6 inches in the vault and Lewis cleared 6 feet 8 inches in the high jump. The only other Bison firsts came in distance races. Freshman Bill Reifsnyder won the 10,000- meter run in a meet and track record time of 30:30.26, while junior Rick Sayre's 9:09.69 easily out-distanced the field in the 3,000 meter steeplechase. Just as impressive in the latter race was the per formance of another freshman, Mike Dechert. After finding himself in eighth place early in the race, Dechert slowly moved up, finishing a superb sec ond. His time of 9:15.69 qualified him for the junior national meet and the IC4A championship meet later this year. Bucknell's sprinting corps was as awesome as the field and distance athletes. Martin Carter '82 earned top honors in this category with three second place finishes and a school record. Carter ran 10.93 in the 200-meter (good for the new record) and was on Bucknell's runner-up 4 x 100 meter relay (49.62). Another workhorse in the sprints was junior Rocky Thompson. Despite a slightly-pulled leg mus cle, Thompson ran on both relays and placed fifth in the 110 meter high hurdles. The competitive attitude that Head Coach Art Gulden cited as the "" key"" to winning the meet was best exemplified by junior 800-meter runner Mark Kaplan. While on a short run Saturday afternoon, Kaplan severely twisted his left ankle. Student trainer Sal Baglio '82 kept the swelling to a minimum, and Kaplan went out that night and qualified for the finals in his event with his best time all year. Despite the impressiveness of the Bucknell win, it was not all that unpredictable. The trackmen had a frequently sluggish spring, but the potential was there, and their dominance of the ECC meet proved it."
